5,"My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semibusy Saturday morning  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better

Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary  It was phenomenal and simply the best Ive ever had  Im pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it  It was amazing

While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete  It was the best toast Ive ever had

Anyway I cant wait to go back"
5,"I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place It goes to show you you can please everyone They are probably griping about something that their own faultthere are many people like that

In any case my friend and I arrived at about 550 PM this past Sunday It was pretty crowded more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said well be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else We were seated at 552 and the waiter came and got our drink orders Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server The prices were very good as well We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 602 We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small Heres The Beef pizza so we can both try them The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one personal and got the small 11 pizza Both were awesome My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but thats how I like my sauce

We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 642 So everything was great and not like these bad reviewers That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues"
5,"Rosie Dakota and I LOVE Chaparral Dog Park Its very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths a desert xeriscape baseball fields ballparks and a lake with ducks

The Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded  You can find trash cans and poopypick up mitts located all over the park and paths

The fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run play and sniff"
5,"General Manager Scott Petello is a good egg Not to go into detail but let me assure you if you have any issues albeit rare speak with Scott and treat the guy with some respect as you state your case and Id be surprised if you dont walk out totally satisfied as I just did Like I always say Mistakes are inevitable its how we recover from them that is important

Thanks to Scott and his awesome staff Youve got a customer for life  "
5,"Drop what youre doing and drive here After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more  The food is that good

This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadnt been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the Grand Opening sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy  A new place to try

It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor smell and cleanliness inside  I ordered dinner for two to go  The menu was awesome  I loved seeing all the variety poblano peppers mole mahi mahi mushroomssomething wrapped in banana leaves  It made it difficult to choose something  Heres what Ive had so far La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show  So much flavor  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros mmmm such a delight  The salsa bar is endless  I really stocked up  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot in fact it all was but Im a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers The horchata is handmade and delicious  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus

As if the good food wasnt enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did  Im a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah  Theres a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar its amazing  All the paintings are great love the artist"
5,Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu Carefully crafted features with much to drink Start with the pork belly buns and a stout Then go on until you can no longer
5,"The oldish man who owns the store is as sweet as can be  Perhaps sweeter than the cookies or ice cream

Heres the lowdown Giant ice cream cookie sandwiches for super cheap  The flavor permutations are basically endless  I had snickerdoodle with cookies and cream ice cream  It was marvelous"
5,Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises
5,"They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza not sure how long its going to last but let me just say it was amazing  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had  I have tried other things too like the tomato basil soup and many of their sandwiches  very good very fresh  every time  

The 5 stars is for the pizza but if I were to rate Jasons Deli over all they would get about a 4"
5,okay this is the best place EVER i grew up shopping at the one in los gatos and the one in Oakville i was shock when i saw the best store in the world in Scottsdale and then not surprised at all the have all the good stuff from cheese down to wine i cant tell you how happy i am that this store is here in Arizona now if we could just get dean and deluca
5,This place shouldnt even be reviewed  because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself  
5,first time my friend and I went there it was delicious  The food garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine  We will be going back ALOT
1,U can go there n check the car out If u wanna buy 1 there Thats wrong move If u even want a car service from there U made a biggest mistake of ur life I had 1 time asked my girlfriend to take my car there for an oil service guess what They ripped my girlfriend off by lying how bad my car is now If without fixing the problem Might bring some serious accident Then she did what they said 4 brand new tires timing belt 4 new brake pads U know whys the worst All of those above I had just changed 2 months before What a trashy dealer is that People better off go somewhere
5,"I love this place I have been coming here for ages
My favorites Elsas Chicken sandwich any of their burgers dragon chicken wings chinas little chicken sandwich and the hot pepper chicken sandwich The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool"
5,"I love love LOVE this place My boss who is into healthy eating recommended this place I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers The food here is so good We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees So also ordered the Kaleaid All of the dishes were yummy 
I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad I always have to get the Kale aid 
Once a guy at the next table uprooted a whole plant by mistake on the patio and was highly embarrassed as was his date Ever since I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness I dont think I can live without True Food"
5,"Disclaimer Like many of you I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been repurposed into restaurants I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo

That being said I absolutely love having lunch here the other day I unknowingly arrived at 205 5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner but was served anyway I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit The sandwich was excellent served on perfectly crisp chewy saltimbocca bread The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese Really really delicious

I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable though a bit small This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby"
1,Disgusting  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out  Very outdated and gaudy 80s style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos  The food itself was pretty bad  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all  After trying it out Im positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them
5,"Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before only in Texas and their service has been great all the time I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect I was pleasantly surprised The store had a good amount of parking and the store front was clean open and had adequate seating around the perimeters There were already 56 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative All the guys working there were busy helping someone yet were saying hello to us and reassuring theyd get to us very soon I didnt wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally He inspected my tires recommended a plan of action gave me options and we headed back into the store After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires he checked their stock and unfortunately they didnt have them there BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed Great The prices were not as heafty relief and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced it took exactly the amount of time theyd told me 45 min They apologized for the wait but no need for that The guy who helped me on the 2nd day Im sorry I forgot his name was also very professional and great I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely Thanks guys

TIP If you know you need to bring your car in you can make an appointment with them online They take walkins but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier and that in turn benefits you"
1,"Ive eaten here many times but none as bad as last night
Service was excellent and highly attentive
Food absolutely horrible

My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood After all they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye 
What I was hoping for was a 1 112 thick steak cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered 
What I got a a 34 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat gristle and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style 
Salad similar to something you could get at Chick Filet
Veggies blah
Bread basket ample but day old and if not it certainly wasnt fresh 

In addition to bad food we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables listening to conversations ranging from someones recent bout with pinkeye and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French until the waiter showed up then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English 

Ive had it with this place
If Im going to pay 150 bucks for dinner itll be at Mortons or Maestro where the steaks are 112 in thick cooked to perfection and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle"
5,Unfortunately for me lux is close to my house  I walk there nearly every day and am much poorer because of it  The coffee and pastries are amazing  They always play really great music too
5,"Fred M pretty much said what I would say so I wont beat a dead horse  Ill add though that they offer a wide variety of deepfried quesadillas  

Did you catch that

DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS"
5,"Alright I have been away from Yelp for quite some time and I feel that this place is fitting to be my comeback review

Chicken and Waffles  Yes chicken and MFin waffles  

In the ghetto  Check
Has sweet tea  Check
Has nononsense quick service  Check
Ridiculously long wait  Check
Best thing that I have eaten in the last year  Check

I have to say not the best fried chicken I have ever had but pretty damn good it could use more seasoning  Now the waffles probably the best ever  The waffles are deliciously soft inside a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them  The seating is cramped but it doesnt matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness

If you are in Phoenix this is a requirement  Come real early or be prepared to wait  Dont forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have KoolAid if that fits your fancy  Even after I came home from Arizona I couldnt stop talking about LoLos for like 2 weeks  Shoot two months later and I am still drooling thinking about it"
5,"This restaurant is incredible and has the best pasta carbonara and the best tiramisu Ive had in my life All the food is wonderful though The calamari is not fried The bread served with dinner comes right out of the oven and the tomatoes are the freshest Ive tasted outside of my moms own garden This is great attention to detail

I can no longer eat at any other Italian restaurant without feeling slighted This is the first place I want take outoftown visitors Im looking to impress

The owner Jon is helpful friendly and really cares about providing a positive dining experience Hes spot on with his wine recommendations and he organizes wine tasting events which you can find out about by joining the mailing list or Facebook page"
1,"I have always been a fan of Burlingtons deals however I will not be shopping at this one again I went to return a belt pretty simple Instead I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buyingputting things on layaway It took three other staff to help her out There were no words said to me except Hold on I was pissed When the lady was finally done the employee at the service asked what do you want Serious help is needed there
 If you work in the area of customer service I think you should have some"
1,Another night meeting friends here  I have to laugh  Waited another 20 minutes for my beer to be refilled at the bar  A girl even took my empty without even asking if I wanted a refill  A new brunette girl that I dont recognize left the bar and sat down with her guy friends on the customer side AT 925 ON A FRIDAY NIGHT  Another bartender had to ask her to come back and work  Management  Pull your head out of your ass  Sad to watch  I need to talk my friends into another place
1,"Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones Hmmmmm Well asked the waitress about it and she said they try the best they can  hmmmmmm isnt this a fish restaurant 
They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back"
5,This an incredible church that embraces the principle that Christ Life Church exists to bring people into a lifechanging relationship with Jesus Christ  Three campuses allow Christ Life to reach into several locationsonline Tempe and Casa Grande   The wonderful childrens and youth programs appeal to a wide perspective of people
5,This is our favorite breakfast place The food is good They have the best biscuits  gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at The wait staff is friendly The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed so there can be a wait to be seated
5,I had looked at several invitation websites along with catalogs with no luck in finding just the right balance of wedding colorsdesign  Thomas at Alphagraphics helped me every step of the way of designing and printing our wedding invitations and programs  I knew I wanted a bookletstyle but needed a little design creativity from Alphagraphics which they nailed  I highly recommend Alphagraphics to anyone needing any print work done  not just wedding invitations  Thomas and his crew are stellar
1,"Yikes reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasnt unique As a server I make a very laid back customer I like pretty much everything I eat and dont require a lot of attention from the waiter 

La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house Our guy though adorable and friendly was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer though charged us for it The ahi tuna highly recommended over the other fish options he said was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken Like other reviewers mentioned he was frantic and made that clear to every customer At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking  they need another person 

I left super stressed out from the experience which is very very unusual for me You can either have bad service or bad food but not both"
5,"I absolutely love this little spot Its a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that I dont have to drive clear out to Scottsdale to find Ive been shopping at Vignettes for about 8 years Whenever I am in a quandary about what to get someone this is the first place that I head to Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand Whether its something for the garden a gift for the new bride or baby a unique piece of art or heavenly scented candles  you will not be disappointed

The owners  staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion  need And they do the most amazing wrap jobs making gift giving even easier

The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it  "
5,Came here with a large group a while back  We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour Happy Hour pricing was fair The food was pretty good The very best thing there is the beer  They had like everything on tap MMMM
1,This is my first year participating in Arizona to sell clothing just wandering how busy its goona be in there  little worried can any one reply me 
5,"Beeror Yoga

Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache is an amazing classy studio for the MindBody connection

Mr Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel After seeing his body transform to only 162 body fat all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had destressed a lot since he started the practice

Luckily she opened up a studio recently and it simply goregous The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from workschool Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery creepy But the gem is truly the practice space Hardwood floors high ceilings a beautiful staircase tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS  

That is right the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and whoever isnt focusing on their tree posturenot the entire class It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks

As for Tish Hegel she is simply outstandingshe has so many credentials you have to read her biography for yourself She has been practicing for a loooong time and her handson instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now bring those shoulders down 

So far I have done  Ashtanga Inspired Flow pretty intense really hurt for 3 days would recommend after getting into yoga for a while Sivananda ditto  Focus Class did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybodys body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga Morning Movement and Flow which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards  She does tons of modifications is always making sure we are okay and is just super personable

I did the huge package since I didnt renew my ASU gym membership for this summer but you can do dropin 

Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending 

NAMASTE"
1,"really I cant believe this place has received such high reviews from people

my lady and i walked in and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone name please instead of a warm friendly french welcome to this rather charming looking place we didnt have a reservation which from the looks of how dead empty the place was didnt seem like a problem until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained shed try to fit us in it was 6pm the place had one other couple dining and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 730 we werent really looking to hang out it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here because if you dont youre automatically a piece of shit according to the staff sorry i dont plan very much ahead next time i will and it wont be here

anyways after debating for a minute or two with herself the hostess decided we could squeeze in and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant she informed us that we could cork our own wine for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars in words only office space could adequately describecoup des tartes what is it exactly that you do 

the food was good nothing spectacular for 25 a plate we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese which was served warm now this is the first warm salad ive had all of my life and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert but i believe salad should be cold and crisp not soggy and warm yuck the cordon bleu was tasty and filling however the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken but it was solved with no thanks to the staff by placing a jackinthebox gift card under the leg i will admit the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best ive ever had my lady got the pork tenderloin which had a strange pepperysweet pairing which i didnt particularly care for we were broke for desert so unfortunately we didnt get to try any tarts you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus other than a 15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos

this place was rather disappointing i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasnt it presents itself as being so high class and french and ohlala wee wee but when it comes down to it its still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland maybe if it were located in the biltmore id give it a bit more cred"
5,"Figured it is time to write a review after going here for quite a few years for dinner on special occasions or just to have some of the best seafood and Bone in fillet around 

First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is
 I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining

If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily

The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right but often wanting more  

Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining 

you will not be disappointed"
5,I cant describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste They literally MELT in your mouth a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken Dill Salmon and the Stilton  SteakBon Appetit everyone And dont forget about the all day everyday3 car bombsyou cant beat that price their happy hour is amazing too
1,"I was really excited about this event maybe my expectations were too high because I was really underwhelmed  Very little shade ran out of water by the time I got there at 1pm other obligations 20 of the vendors were out of food and by the time I ate my way through some everyone else was already out   60 bucks for that  I dont think so  

And when I mentioned it to the person in charge he was patronizing invalidating and kept telling me how happy the chefs were  Well Im your consumer big guy  

Sorry Devoured wish it could have been better 

What food I did try was pretty good"
1,"The beach paradise of IxtapaZihuatenejo awaited usunfortunately so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places

Long story short13 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone chargernot to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my sons baby food and milk for litmus tests

I looked on the bright sideat least we didnt get deported "
5,"So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor Premium coffee roasted inhouse in the middle of the desert no less Who would have thunk it

Baristas were profesh and friendly They even warmed up our pastries upon request Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale where great coffee is few and far between"
5,Awesome subs clean and friendly well priced
5,"I LOVE Chic Nails

I used to go to Tip  Toes on 48th street and Ray Road until one day they were too busy to take my friend and I in for pedicured We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since 

The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price I highly recommend this nail salon over any other

PS It is extremely close to CKs Bar  Grill to go for happy hour after "
5,After the Padres Spring Training game we had reservations at Don  Charlies in Scottsdale   None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlies your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League  Colorado  Coors Light  Texas Shiner Bock Chicago Old Style and San Diego Stone IPA etc  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great I wasnt thrilled with the side dish potatos au gratin which is a 250 upcharge  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out this place was packed  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself  He was signing his book or a baseball for a 200 charitable donation to his foundation Needless to say I m not bringing home any memorabilia myself
5,Best food super friendly staff and great prices Love it
5,Christy is an amazing cake artist  She has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity  Her cakes are amazing and are truly oneofakind  She also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you   She has made several cakes for our family and I have been impressed with everyone of them  I was also excited to see her compete on TLCs Ultimate Cake Off show early this spring  If youre looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party then I recommend you call Phoenix Cake Company
1,See the huge sign outside that says 250 Yeah thats for shirts only I was caught off guard when I brought in my skirt and got nailed for about 379 As I sadly handed over my 5 bill the lady at the counter said a lot of people had told her they felt betrayed by the sign outside No kidding I had originally been heading down the street to Regal on 7th Avewho does a fine job in half the pickup timefor the advertised fake price here Trying to make the best of it  I told the lady at least Id learned they had an onsite alteration service and maybe that was worth a buck UH OH Picked up my skirt a few weeks later with some Jersey Shoretype chick at the counter and was told I owed another 379 I flatout refused to pay twice She screamed at me chased me to my car wrote down my license plate and said the police would be visiting Niiiice
5,"After driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office building in the 60s my husband and I found the amazing Fuego Bistro We had a perfect meal there Amazing ambiance twinkly lights in the courtyard live musician Great wine Food was so unique and delicious Id describe it as SouthernSpanish fusion This meal was the highlight of our trip to Phoenix 

If you live in Phoenix you have no excuse to not come here I live in Chicago and Im sure Ill be back"
5,"Its just like pizza bianco without the wait This pizza is a 99999 and bianco is a 10 This place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for 

If bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here"
5,"As mentioned earlier the best thing about this place is the super cheap but super delicious lunch bentos  You get a main dish rice salad and an orange for under 4 If thats not enough you can get double meat for a buck or two more  I highly recommend the ginger pork or the katsu  My friend I normally go with is a big fan of the white fish fried or grilled  The sushi here isnt bad  Its nothing super special but I dont come here for the sushi so its not a big knock against the place

As they would say on ebay A Great Seller Would eat here again"

1,"Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat dont expect the best service  Entrees cost about 2038 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 520 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar  They also have a big cheese selection 

I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal  He didnt even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese  it comes with jellys and such   

My meal was good I had the duck  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy  Not fresh at all  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe  maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce Nothing too special  

Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar  If we dont want to give 25 dont charge it plain and simple  

Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part  

Two thumbs way down"
1,Take your money elsewhere unless youve got kids  I really try to like this place  A family member signed me up for the discount card so Ive been going more often but I just dont love it  Its simply ok but the prices are outrageous  And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the soso food  The cocktails are alright but again the price is not right  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the lightup cocktail glasses which cost extra  Ive seen a lot of happy families in here though so I bet its better if you have little ones to bring along
5,Took my fiance there for Valentines day Birthday  I did a lot of research of romantic places around the Valley and this one really caught my eye  Immediately after walking through the door youll notice a dark and romantic ambiance with a lot of candle light  Seating is a bit tight but it wasnt bad enough for me to give it a lower review  We began with an appetizer called Table side guacamole which was incredible to say the least  It literally is made in front of your table  Then it was onto the main dish Buildyourown  Pork tacos  Talk about tender meat  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork  The tortillas were exceptional and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze  So the food was absolutely deliciousbut the service was equally impressive  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night and I drink plenty  Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said Happy Valentines Day and Happy Birthday to my fiance which made the experience even better  A fantastic place that Ill have no problem recommending to others to visit
5,"I have had a great experience every time I have been there  The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant  

Portions are reasonable not huge Im a big feller and I was satified every time I ate there  

Very pleasant environment clean spacious and calm"
5,I love this restaurant I have been a fan of the Newport Beach location for years Scottsdale definitely did not disappoint The staff is friendly and knowledgeable The drinks are fresh worth the extra wait for the tasty Cucumber Jalapeño marg And the food Goes without saying its CRAVE worthy This is a new location so I expected the usual growing pains But overall a great dining experience Welcome to the neighborhood SOL Cocina
5,"That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome 5 stars 

The smoked corn was a little Meh it was oily like not butter oily not a huge fan of the texture either I like corn crunchy and it was not 

Service was great 

I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing but bugs have to eat too right still 5 stars lol"
1,"My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are I tried it but it didnt do anything for me  The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway but twice the price  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich 

What I had
Ham cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta one was parmesan and the other was macaroni Maybe it was the panini bread I think the parmesan pasta was made there but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton It wasnt anything to brag home about 

I found out the head chef made my sandwich keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers no personality whatsoever I asked for his suggestion and his reaction was anythings good 

Normally when I go to AJs I go for their desserts Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price  I can take an assortment home and have them for later 

Our company does use them for their catering and Ive had many compliments on their dishes but pass on the lunches"
5,Very friendly and knowledgeable guys
5,I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet  Good food good service no complaints   Still have never made it here for happy hour but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal  The staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another  Ive only ever eaten sushi here but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh  I would recommend trying this restaurant
1,Absolutely horrendous  This post office will lose your mail repeatedly laugh about it to your face lie about it blow it off make it seem like its your fault and make you wish you had sent it UPS
5,Im from Chicago so Im picky with my pizzathis place does it right NY style I love the hole in the wall feel Every customer that walked in was a regular which was a good sign I ordered the Mozzarella sticks and a large Monster Pie Sausage pepperoni bell peppers onion and cheese The mozzarella sticks took a little while to come out but they were cooked to perfection They also threw in a few garlic knots which was awesome The pizza was unbelievableI think the crumbled sausage really did it They have great deals like large pie  20 wings for 20 which I definitely will be taking advantage of during football games on Sunday Glad to have found a new place where I can also be a regular
1,"Other than the really great happy hour prices its hit or miss with this place More often a miss 

The food is less than average the drinks NOT strong  at least they are inexpensive  but the service is truly hit or miss

Ill pass"
5,"Perhaps it was foolish for me to give La Condesa only four stars at first given the fact that I really liked it  What can I say  Im critical by nature  I knew I was going back soon so I felt like I had to save the last for a return visit  Well it just got it

This place is fantastic  In fact if CenPho lets this one go under I will personally hold all of you responsible watch out for a citizens arrest if I ever see you  However that is unlikely to happen because the food is damn tasty  

Today the Oaxaca black mole chicken taco had me swooning topped with pickled onions the chicken is tender and simmered in the lovely sauce  The Soronan carne asada taco chargrilled over mesquite charcoal is no slouch either Id rate it right up there with some of my favorites in town  

Go to this place I have a feeling Ill be here at least weekly  When and if they ever get a beerliquor licenseprobably more"
5,Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee Their hot chocolate is amazing
1,Been here for many years but have seen a recent decline in quality service Felt scolded by the bartender today at lunch Felt disrespected as a customer Service sucks stay away bad service  bad review
5,Hands down the best breakfast Ive ever had anywhere It definitely feels like home cooked breakfast Ive never been to this place on the weekend when it isnt packed out the door Im not the only person that loves this place
5,"This place is fantastic

We went in on Sunday the 29th of July around 500pm The guy behind the counter told us to enjoy ourselves take our time ask if we had any questions We wandered around for a bit I found a bottle of Argyle bubbly that I wanted and then began to stare with lust in my eyes at the selection of Absinthe 

Girlfriend wandered over to ask the guy to recommend a white that wasnt a Chard as we both really dont like buttery oak anything He took a few cues from her and found a great bottle of white which we drank with great glee last night 

This was a test for the guy behind the counter She didnt set a price limit just said show me your favorite He could have done what many others have in the past and shown us a 50 bottle but instead he showed us a kick ass bottle at the 14 price point This is the mark of a good wine seller Find you what you want without bending you over on the price Yes sometimes I want to spend 400 a bottle but not all that often Id rather get my drink on at the price he found and he turned us onto a white we both REALLY liked which is super rare as we have very different tastes

Well absolutely be going back to buy more fermented grape from this place

Prices are on par with Total Wine but what youre really paying for is the help of someone who knows what they sell and likes their job Great job Sportsmans see you next Sunday for afternoon drinking"
5,Recently moved back to Mesa I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal A sandwich made with seared lightly breaded haddock sliced hardboiled egg fresh basil romaine lettuce tomato Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll The brioche was amazing It was light and fluffy The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce This was perfectly done The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me This is a mustvisit lunch time destination Dinner review shortly
5,"What a wonderful night It didnt start out that way I found this restaurant on yelp not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at I heard the grief all the way there Come on honey its an adventure 

We arrived and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table Zach our waiter was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious 

I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special gluten free menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat Zach even brought us some special wheatfree dipping sauce for the Summer rolls He showed great care provided great customer service  and the sauce  was delicious

The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special Oh the bathrooms were clean too Thanks Zach and thanks Malees It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating Yes she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it"
5,I am a way more frequent visitor of the bell rd location but sometimes I have to travel downtown for work When I do I make my route pass by this place because I have to have dutch bros  The guys at the bell location are pretty familiar with me by now but these guys still treat you as if you are there best customer And its the best coffee Ive ever had
5,Even more great newson Tuesdays there is a special of 35c per ounce Not that I needed another incentivebut this is GREAT
5,"Where to begin

This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever Ive been frequenting Carolinas for years and never once have I been disappointed Some might compare it to Filibertos or any of those insert surname herebertos but this is on a whole different level

Atmospherewise its one step above a sketchy holeinthewall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks I dont know their secret but their beans the tortillas the salsa its all to die for And ITS SO CHEAP Like seriously Id dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake 

Its almost always busy but its always worth the wait Always

If you havent gone youre missing out"
5,"I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens  We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 500pm but decided to give it a shotit was worth it  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 500pm and several walking areas were being used for weddingsreceptions who could blame these people but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife  We managed to get in for free not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though which totally made the park that much more fun  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if Id had to pay 5 to get in

The little desert ratsqirrels and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows  I felt like a little kid oohing and ahing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers and have to give this place the ultimate rating   If youre ever in Arizona please give this place a try its very well put together and a beautiful site to see"
5,"Being Indian and having grown up in London I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix Ive tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time Ive left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come

Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and Im stoked Its not as good as the stuff back home And Im sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York But if you are looking for something closer to home you cant go wrong

Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too Cant be bad"
1,This place is not there anymore
5,Gaylee is great She is super sweet and so professional Her work is amazing I found her through one of those online deals and now I am convinced that I will never go elsewhere Keep up the great work
1,Rarely do I give a 1 star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this  After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek SLOW  and they are charging us 64 a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs  Furthermore I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding  Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax  As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse
5,The praise and worship with Pastor BJ just sets up a God Filled service with the charismatic and awesome Pastor Maiden  Going the Past 18 months has made our Marriage Stronger and Faith Magical
5,"I come here probably at least once a week The prices are right theres a good variety of ethnic food the cashiers are quick and friendly and theyre just helpful I locked myself out of my car when having a spacecadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out 

Fresh flowers  great selection of wine and cheese  all the essentials 

They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they dont have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible  GO TJS"
5,"I have only gotten the cafe sua da iced coffee here but its the best I have had yet When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk I dont get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful rich dark and creamy coffee This is strong stuff that first sip is so good The richness full flavor creamy caramel flavors are heavenly  And as the ice melts it mellows out the flavor a little and its still great I cant say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley but what I have had this is my favorite 

Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho"
5,"Hippies scare me     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an online Canadian pharmacy which I have been taking for three days now  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippieland

It was all for nothing No hippies around just a teenager behind the counter  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level I dont know how anyone under 76 could easily eat off of them  

Anyways for 5 flat you get a kick ass burger a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skinon fries and a can of soda   Its true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick

Id be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say its organic dont panic  

Jerrys dead but this place lives on  Thanks hippies"
5,"Man do I LOVE a restaurant with REALLY GOOD food and friendly service Liberty Market is definitely that 

Funny thing is that I was originally going to eat at Joes Farm Grill but ended up here after a search here on YELP

Nice laid back decor too

You wait in line to place your order pay and they give you a stand with a number on it like at Sizzler then someone brings your order

I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too

I forgot to try one of their dessertsthe last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me maybe I had a look of panic on my faceWOW This service is rare to find

The restrooms are quite amusing Saw a similar setup in NYC Each toiletwatercloset is individualno stalls They were VERY CLEAN too ok I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a mens restroom since it was all unisexno worries

I cant wait to visit here againbut after I check out their other place across the street Joes Real BBQ YUM"
5,Great experience from start to finish  Host who was the owner seated us at a table with a view  Was given house made foccacia bread and olive oil  Was awesome  Some of the best bread Ive ever had before a meal  The olive oil was seasoned perfectly too  My grandma got the burger and I got the pesto penne primavera  The pasta came with shrimp squash and some other vegetables  I love pesto so this hit the spot  Good serving size but not too much  The food tasted fresh  They make their own pasta which was delicious  The burger was huge  Looked like you get your moneys worth  The ice tea was even good  The place was clean and sleek  They played good music and the service was perfect  It has been a while since I had such a good overall experience with no complaints  I will be coming back  The host who we later found out was the owner was working that night and asked us how we liked everything  Ive said it before but that is a rare and good touch for any restaurant  Well done
5,Great customer service competitive rates and I always get a call right back from Jeff Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers I would recommend giving him a call
5,We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was Im sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day My date was equally impressed so Im sure I will be back
5,Screw Disneyland Sephora is the happiest place on earth  They have everything a girly girl or a girly guy could possibly dream of and then some They have all the best brands in cosmetics skin care and perfume and theyre always adding new items to their extensive product selection  To me getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again  Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes lip plumping glosses lashextending mascaras and antiaging face creams what more could anyone ask for I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora but they do have some products for guys too although not many  As far as I know Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale but even as great as it is it still cant beat the one right on the strip in Vegas  Theyre open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand what could be better than that
5,I loved this little slice of heaven  Reasonable prices tiny dining room very personal service  Pablo was laid back but with only 4 couples in the small establishment he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of
1,"What a load of absolutely hideous uninteresting crap

Take every single onestar review written by Yelpers below copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with

I have no reason to ever come here Certainly not free will The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend"
5,"AZ88 is at once chic urban fun and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face as a tshirtandjeanswearing overweight guy

Youll first notice the atmosphere and with good reasonits perfectly lit with noticeable but not mindnumbingly blaring music and even better they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your WednesdaySaturday evening dining experience When I first hit AZ88 it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers Overall a very different fun look

Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound and while they typically have a rocksteady delivery more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friends purse to her chagrin That aside the food is fantastic and even though its a bit hard to get out of here for under 30 per person because you simply must try the cheesecake and drinks are pushing 14 its worth it as a classybutcasual night out that you can really enjoy

They have a great patio the burger is dripping with flavor and in fact cheese and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything Great salads and sandwiches help round things out and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake youll have the good chance to try Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense these people know how a cheesecake is done It is rich thick with just a hint of sour and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom

Overall a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them in good humor or as appropriate not Weve never run afoul of that rule but you wouldnt want to I assure you"
5,Fun with caps if I did that sort of thing The whole experience was great you wont get any specifics this review is 3 weeks after I cant remember sorry Service was by that waitress who does everything perfectly Explain food wine doesnt stay too long Nice interesting big room decor Looking forward to the next time
5,Who dosent like Cosco I love this place The pizza is cheap and good
5,A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night The food  service was great I think we scared our poor server Mike but he was wonderful
5,"I love this restaurant even though its a chain and I can hear my brother saying its just a glorified Red Lobster 

I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon stuffed with crab shrimp and brie cheese which was unbelievably amazing I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious but could barely breathe after eating all that food 

The service was outstanding although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying 

I cant wait to come back here"
5,"On one of my many visits to see mi amore he took me to this fantastic little pizza joint The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45 yes folks 45 So the 2 12 hour wait was expected and very VERY worth it The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut either You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage pepperoni slices salami slices arugula fresh basil leaves tomatoes etc Basically what Im getting at is this is beyond words delicious classic LEGIT Italian pizza Around the dining area you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated The smell in that place is heavenlyincredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen

PS GET THERE EARLY"
5,"The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix  It is light airy and tasty and does not give you that I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour feeling

The ingredients are fresh and delicious  

I am hooked"
1,"Wednesday 7pm  This place is your average over priced lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different 

I have to say I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews now Im starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food

Serviceslow
Foodjust tastes like salt
Noiseloud and they do a dancelike a lot

Go somewhere else and skip Joes Crabs"
1,"I had not been to an Oreganos in like 10 years They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try so why not

Ill tell you Why NOT we has two thin crust pizzas and I even hate to call them that More like crackers with melted cheese and some toppings

That was some of the worst excuse for pizza Ive ever had Most of the fastfood delivery pizza Ive had beats it  and I do not like at all delivery pizza

Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust god it could not be worse

It only deserves one star for the good service other than that is the another subpar overpriced gourmet pizza joint

If you want expensive and good pizza there are many good alternatives Pizzeria Bianco Grimaldis etc"
5,I was a regular at Mias first location in WrigleyvilleChicago Scott the original founderchef and present owner is the reason Mia Francesca is what it is Not sure if us folks up here in Scottsdale know how lucky we are he landed on our door step Food service vibeif I could give it six stars I would
5,"Excellent service and food           

enjoyed live music on patio"
5,Love Krista
5,"I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers and had to leave with one Luckily she offers great discounts after her classes

Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer dont know how I lived without one all these years and also a wheat grinder Everytime I go in here I find something I cant live without

Shar has great classes and tips on how to utilize all her products Well worth it to attend a class I just wish the store was closer to Glendale

So glad I found shars now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too"
5,"Need fig preserves Theyve got it Fennel Its beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end The butcher has your back Duck fat Just take a peek in the freezer section Sometimes its the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars

AJs closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel I came up empty handed on both items I say simple items  but its amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise AJs carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for

Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I10 freeway courtesy of my phone company but cant find fennel within a 10 mile radius

This my friends is why I love AJs And as someone who watches Americas Test Kitchen as though it were food porn I can say that any other grocer doesnt stand a chance against Eddie Bashas high end store

You truly do get what you pay for For all the employees at AJs I say THANK YOU for the great service you provide and the products you offer"
5,"Love me some hidden house 

The music is too loud The drinks too cheap The clientele too local But Ive never had anything but a good time there Whether its karaoke or weird shit on the weekends youll have fun if you dont expect it to be Merc cuz Merc it aint And not for one moment in its life has it pretended to be But I love it for what it is and thats an experience"
5,"Cowboy Ciao is one my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale  To start with they share a wine list with Kazimierz  My favorite menu item is the Stetson Chopped salad  My only wish is that the serving was bigger  I cant get enoughand Im too embarrassed to order two  The flavors in this salad are amazing  Smoked salmon Israeli cous cous creamy dressing

For dinner I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry  The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadnt had before  Its great

I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this  It was not good at all  It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of baconick  Thank God my husband ordered the ChocolatePeanut Butter pot pie so I could steal from him"
5,"Great Mexican food 
Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes 
Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada
Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish"
1,I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong Not cheap I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit  almost 30 for a twopiece suit after they tacked on their 6 designer brand surcharge no I am not kidding Despite branding as green the suit still reeked of solvent the green silicabased solvents have never left an odor in my experience No differentiation to justify these absurd prices  a lot of good alternatives in the area Be warned
5,What a fabulous dining experience My boyfriend and I are always looking for new places to try and came upon this place on Yelp when our regular Saturday spot decided to no longer be opened for lunch Saturdays Right upon entering we were greeted by someone behind the register and he sat us down at a booth The decor was great and the place was spotless We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items The Monte Cristo was perfection and the home made blueberry and strawberry jam was excellent The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and eggs cooked perfectly I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and this is now going to be our regular weekend breakfastbrunch place
1,Where are the managers   It took 1 12 hours for our meal to come out at 815 in the evening  Items came out at different times so we couldnt all eat at the same time  The asparagus tempura was inedible because they didnt cut the ends  Waitress just took it away and did not comp us  Waitress knew next to nothing about the sushi menu  She sat and talked with the hostess the entire time instead of waiting on her tables  Food was WAY over priced and I couldnt speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud  One of the worst dining experiences in a long time  Paid 70 for a dinner for 4 and went home hungry  HORRIBLE
5,I was sad to come back to lai lais and they no longer had the Mongolian  boo but i took my mom there and we were starving so we decided to order off the menu My mom is allergic to  msg and they helped us with what we should order and she didnt get sick woo hoo we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her  my bf and myself and we stilll brought food home and I dont think we spent over 30 bucks for all that food it was very good to i love good cheap food Ill be back they are always friendly
5,Very good My wife and I stopped by randomly on our way back and had beef pho and veggie pho I eat large portions and this is the first time ever I didnt finish a bowl of pho If in the area we will stop again for sure
5,"Went here today Sunday about 850 and it was crowded but not to bad about 12 hour wait Im warning you now dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in 

About 10am is when it really got packed just about when we got done I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup heaven I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me 
My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish my sons and mine where not that much food especially for 9 We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper Not complaining because it was good but be ready 
There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns they both only made thru about halfway  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right My son really didnt like his reeses pancakes
Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w gravy chicken fried steak w hashbrowns bannana pecan caramel french toast"
5,Love this location at Gainey Ranch Great food consistently
5,Our server Gary was awesome Food was amazingan experience
5,We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club  Everything was so tasty juices are freshsqueezed  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early  Be sure to give it a try
5,I had other piercings done here and then went out of state and got my nose pierced with a friend and when i got back I was having problems with it I went in and talked to them and they changed out the stud for me gave me a discount on the jewelry and were really fun friendly professional and very informative This place is top notch Wont go to another place for my piercings again No way It is very clean and these guys know their stuff Really impressedI could go on and on I wont get my jewelry anywhere else eitherthey have a a great variety and if they dont have something you want they order it easy peasy Love it
5,The food here is awesome every time I come here we have a great time And the waitress kimberly Couldnt ask for better waitress
5,"OK Ive decided that other coffee shops sell swill I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way like unstressed people think about sex I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning Seriously I would be there every day 

The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up even on the mushiest afternoon No bitterness not overly sweet just blissful in an Ivejustbeenbitchslappedbycaffeine sort of way of course 

Oh and the sandwiches I complained about Replaced by real deli looking ones in clamshells Far more appetizing But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake 

Dont make me break out the voodoo Dazbog Just open at 600 am like any other coffee shop and well be BFFs"
5,Whats not to love Herb n Flavors uses local high quality ingredients the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian vegan and glutenfree friendly I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip We will definitely be back soon  
5,Excellent New Mexico style food great hatch green chile
5,I love this location The food is always great and the service is good Wifi is a plus especially since I am going to school I come here almost everyday I recommend this location to everyone
5,"Awesome country club Great new remodled gym heated Olympic pool for year round use  Love the family like atmosphere plenty of planned family eventspool parties 

Only complaint wish members who didnt pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis   Regardless courts are top notch great facilities and friendly staff"
5,This is probably the sweet I crave the most Salted Butter Caramel Yummmm When I cant make it up to Scottsdale I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good
5,"This was the first real ballet I have ever been to and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years 

Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning When I walked in I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures The bartenders we bought our drinks from was very friendly and accomodating 

I cant say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers the sets the costumes etc Just incredible I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season"
1,"Still quite poor both in service and food maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak MandarinCantonese I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation 

The dish came out with zichini and bell peppers what  Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion On pointing this out all I got was  Oh you like peanuts ok I will put some on and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken

Well at that point I was happy that atleast the chicken pieces were present else she would probably end up sprinkling raw chicken pieces on it like the raw peanuts she dumped on top of the food 

Well then  I spoke a few chinese words and the scowl turned into a smile and she then became a bit more friendlier 

Unfortunately I do not condone this type of behavior It is all in poor taste"
5,Great service
5,My favorite Starbucks in Mesa Its not even the closest one to my home but worth the experience GREAT staff
1,First I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant  Second we miss the bloody mary bar too  Hubby  I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong  Okay she doesnt know beer  We liked the chips  salsa it was a good start then I took a sip of my water  What the  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like but this was weird  The aftertaste made me cringe I couldnt drink it even with a slice of lemon in it maybe it was the ice  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas which he orders practically everywhere and it was so bad he didnt finish it  My meal was not memorable either  I wanted to love this place or at least like it  We walked out of there terribly disappointed I doubt well go back
1,"Id say Ive been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue By all means no But there are some very common themes among the shows Ive seen here even though the artists were different genres different crowds and even different times of year 

The sound quality is terrible The last three bands that I have seen there and have seen in other venues as well all complained that they couldnt get the sound right on their monitors or in the house To me thats a major turn off if the band isnt happy with their sound are they going to be very motivated to play Maybe its a slighted observation but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue are the ones that play music where the sound quality isntlets say sacrificed or as important metal hardcore thrasher hiphop whatever you call it 

The venue is also hot I dont read the reviews of others before I review a location because I dont want my opinions to be skewed but I noticed someone said dont wear pants honestly thats a really good tip The last show I saw here was in June I know its Phoenix in the summer suck it up But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly cooler than inside the venue weve got issues can they not afford to run the ac 

The answer to that question is maybe not The bar is understaffed and patrons seem to be lined up 3 deep all around Sometimes youve got to spend money to make money Hire more bartenders customers get served faster thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more That means you can sell more which means you will make more money What a concept 

Hate to just destroy a business but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively Until then remember if youve always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a lowfi format heres your chance if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons I support you and finally you should craft a clever way to hide a flask since you wont get served although this might be difficult sans bottoms"
1,Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for but this one is worth skipping The service Ive experienced each time Ive been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold
5,The food was flavorful and plenty of it Eating with only your fingers is quite fun  make your momma proud My girlfriend won the best dish of the night  lentils and chicken and cabagecarrots It all had kind of sweetishbitterishspicy flavor I had the lamb and jalapeño dish which was kind of greasy You eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you  a tartish type crepe which goes well with the food Id be happy to go back and try something different  If you are used to frozen pizzas and Burger King you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume
5,"I honestly have only positive things to say about Postinos since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between this place does it all right If you go here hungry you should know that your options are basically a panini a salad or some bruschetta Ive had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you cant go wrong the the bruschetta I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto

Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if youre planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company you might be better off getting a bottle A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 12 glasses extra Bonus

Someday Ill actually take advantage of their 20 deal for wine and bruschetta"
5,"we went back here again this past weekendactually we went there 3 more times this past weekend alone  we couldnt resist the awesome service and great pricesand great live music  this is definately going to be one of our regular joints  if you like the countrycountry girlsand good old rowdy shitthen stop by and check it out for yourself  i bet you will like this place  
there is a large dance floor for some shit kickin about 3 pool tablesbig buck hunter and an outdoor area for smokin and boozin and dart throwin  i love this place  this is what toby keith should have been singing aboutseriously"
1,"How does this restaurant generate so many 4 and 5 star ratings 

I know it was on the food channel but honestly the food was subpar Maybe it was just an off day but I have a feeling it wasnt The prices were not outrageous but it wasnt cheap either The atmosphere was nice if very cafeteria like

But the food was way way too greasy And bland And my stomach now aches after eating there"
5,I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there I wouldnt have found it otherwise  This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler  Its a quaint little diner with modest décor  I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly  As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients  Cheddar isnt better its all about havarti folks  I neednt look further I knew thats what I was having  Hawaiian bread French toast bacon turkey egg and the havarti  absolutely delicious  Cant wait to come back and bring everyone I know
5,"The mall of malls for sure So many designer boutiques so little time On this trip I was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the Fossil storewhat fun they were I enjoyed a smoked chicken  black bean salad  Z Tejas next and the service was excellent I then perused the new styles at Aqua before finding a great pair of shades at Solstice  shoppers bliss 
This review is a bit late I visited the center on 12712  and Ill be back "
5,"What an unbelievable night we had at Mastros City Hall Steakhouse Everything we ate was top notch the atmosphere is fun and the service is spectacular How many steakhouses play Jim Croce Beatles and Beach Boys Its a very welcome change

Its dark its sexy and its probably the best steakhouse in Arizona 

The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters crab legs claws and huge shrimp My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat Ive had all year Gorgonzola mac  cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well Im not a dessert person but the warm butter cake should be illegal its so good I was stuffed already when it came to the table and then I ate all of it 

The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp and when I told the waiter dont worry about it he said ok and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on its own bed of ice It was a really top notch recovery This place is absolutely amazing"
1,My wife and I live around the corner hadnt eaten here in a few months We got food for take out Mongolian beefkung po chickenpad Thai noodles  Mongolian beef there were more white onions then scallions and it was very bland Kung po chickenlots of white meat chicken the whole dish only had one peanut and the taste of this dish was non existent Very very Blah Pad Thai noodlesthe dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump It tasted like plain noodles i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge toadd to it Then it was edible  We will not be going back to GS Very disappointed  From now on it will be Jade palace on 92nd street For take out Asian   Do yourself a favor go elsewhere 
5,"So your going to Scottsdale via Paradise Valleyor your coming from Scottsdale heading eastyour stomach is growling but you dont want the usualthen look no further than Jasons Deli I was in that situation on Friday night and decided to give this locale a tryand I must say I was not disappointed I had the Smokey Jack Panini with Smoked turkey breastguacamoleprovolone cheeselettucetomatobacon on the side which I gave to my wifeLOLsince I dont eat red meatand Russian dressing However sandwich was made to order and pressed perfectly on the grilland the flavor was outstanding They give you a pickle and homemade potato chips on the sideand I also had some lemonade which comes from a fountain with free refills 

I almost missed out on the free Ice Creambut I seen people walking around with cones of Ice Cream and I had my wife ask was it free Indeed it was and we both enjoyed a nice Ice Cream conemine was chocolate vanilla swirland you can also get it in a cup as well The service was great and the whole place had a real nice neighborhood feel to itI look forward to returning here very soon Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends"
5,"After a year in the Valley one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar  I really like the atmosphere  It was sleek yet cozy The night we went in it was hopping but not overly crowded  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded pretentious Scottsdale hotspots 

As I get older I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill  Also I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause  SideBar is just that kind of establishment  If anyone is on Twitter follow buzzcation  SideBarphx has let buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours  Its a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples "
5,"Ive been a bunch of times for takeout and took a seriously picky foodie friend this past weekend  Everything Ive had here has been excellent and I mean excellent  

In the past Ive had the margherita pizza eggplant parm and fried calamari  All good  This weekend we had the comp tapenade beef carpacchio lasagna and one of the pizzas cant remember name  had olives art hearts ham and   All delicious  The lasagna was so delicate but melded perfectly with the sauce

My very particular picky friend LOVED the place  Seriously loved it"
5,As good as it gets  We ate here for a birthday celebration and we were taken away by the great food and service as usual  We requested the V Lounge and were given a nice corner booth  When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant  a very nice touch  For appetizers we had oysters and the best crab cakes anywhere  Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine  Overall just incredible  Completely up to par with Eddie Vs standards  comparing to Houston and Austin  My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her  We also got a followup phone call the next day asking how everything went  For those special occasions or a fun happy hour Eddie Vs never lets you down  Also their Bananas Foster is divine  Save room for it or just stuff your face and go to the gym the next day  delish
1,There really isnt much I like about Michaels to begin with  I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing  but this location was a particular disaster  Clean up your aisles for goodness sake I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around  its like the clothing section at KMart but possibly worse
5,Heart be still I loved this place Way better than I expected I had the spicy noodles and they were delicious flavor great and quality was on point For desert the sticky rice with mango I dream about it now Highly recommend if you are in the mood for Thai food Ill be back
5,Still 5 stars but sadly Amber is closing up shop  Dont feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her  Damn her  I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts all at 60 off  So hurry over and pick up some bargains  And wish Amber good luck
5,This is my favorite spa in the world Hopefully Ill make it to othersbut if I could only get to the Camelback Inn Id be in heaven Heres the rundown of how I enjoy the place Early morning appointment for massage  Rose does fantastic hot stone  I like her the best Then I shower and get into the eucalyptus steam room Next I head out to the pool and savor the view of Camelback Mountain and the amazing desert landscaping theyve procured I drink some water and as I lounge there I order a small healthy and very tasty meal usually breakfast I swim a little lounge a lot  regardless of the time of year  If I have planned it I then head back into the showers and clean up for my next treatment I spend hours there and if I feel like I might be pressed for time I reschedule
5,"3 syllables for this place 
AMAZING

The best Phoenix has to offer"
5,Ive been coming here since the 70s when it was across the street and had a screen door I know the staff and the daily specials by heart  When I lived away from PHX it was the place I wished for When I go to NYC I have to take RM food to my friends The whole family agrees I dont understand the negative reviews The reviewers must have had a bad day I love the food and so has everyone  I know
5,The food and service were both amazing Ive had the gyro pita orzo and greek potatoes All were fantastic Try the gelato also Its the best in town The owners are very friendly and happy to speak with each customer
5,"Ritas Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn While this may be a hotspot for hotel guests I think that locals might be missing out on its charm 

I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Ritas Kitchen is no exception This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night 

Breakfast 

Breakfast at Ritas is sublime and pretty reasonably priced They offer a breakfast buffet for around 23 which includes eggs made to order including omelets pancakes waffles pastries fresh fruit bacon sausage and hashbrowns Its a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast Just today was Mothers Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet I did catch a glimpse of the Mothers Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant patio and RBar but they also had an extensive dessert area with buildyourown sundaes freshly made cotton candy in an old fashioned cotton candy maker and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain 

Lunch

Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind If the weather permits sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains views of the mountain and tropicaldesert setting"
5,"We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner  When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me  i asked them to put me in first available and they said 1520min and then 45min for a booth

Ok Ill wait

Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time  We were there for about 10min already  Thats when she said to us Your table inside is ready  she walked us right there and we were sat  WOW  that was quick

We ordered drinks and food  I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow they were delicious  For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish  It definitely hit the spot  My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside  I wont let that affect the rating though

Awesome place"
5,We stayed at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch during spring break and had a fabulous time We ate at SWB for lunch and enjoyed it so much we ordered dinner that evening to eat in the room with our kids My husband ordered me the chocolate caramel tart which turned out to be one of the best desserts Ive ever had I tried looking for the recipe and couldnt find it so I figured it wouldnt hurt to ask for it Surprisingly I received an almost immediate response from the hotel that they would let the chef know Within a few hours the recipe from the chef was in my email with additional tips Now I call that customer service We loved the hotel and loved the restaurant Looking forward to going back someday
5,Called these guys when an evap cooler water pressure line at my office burst  A guy with a clean white shirt tucked in to his pants introduced himself to me assessed my problem and quoted a very fair price to fix it This guy was way too clean personable and professional to be the plumber He went right to work and had everything back to normal for me in no time You have to understand I am use to a dirty loud intrusive  plumber that smiles with his butt  These guys won me over and their telephone number 6239774458 is in my cell phone now  I highly recommend Palmers Plumbing
5,"I got a coupon at a past Yelp event to try them out and Im SO glad I did  Massage Envy really exceeded my wildest expectations for a chain that offers affordable rates for massage therapy  I was pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and professionalism that I experienced

My massage therapist was Dannie and she worked through my trigger points and loosened my tight muscles with an intuition that I have rarely experienced

I highly recommend this place and hope to return soon"
5,Ask for Alex  he is very helpful and knowledgeable with products in the store He is a young college student and works part time but always has a great attitude and finds the best deals for our family Thanks Alex
5,"Its the place to be 

I went before heading over to Symphony Hall and seeing Ballet AZ perform Giselle Having heard great reviews about the place its food and the vibe I had to try it

Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store Hannys has the feel straight of of New York City The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy intimate feelings and with long pew style seating with individual tables the vibe is very posh

My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza Very good choice The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side so be wary of that but it was delish The pizza was much bigger than we expected For 10 you really do get a good deal 

We each orded drinks A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling Wasnt a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan hed ever had which I believe

Hannys has a modern feel with a touch of Mad Men and I simply cannot wait to go back"
5,Definitely one of my favorite places to eat hands down  I love their enchiladas verdes combo  Their refried beans are THE BEST  I have been eating here for over 15 years and the waitresses are mostly the same  Definitely feels like you are at an old friends house when you are there  Yes it is in a bad area but that hasnt ever deterred me from telling everyone I know that if they want really good real Mexican food at a great price to head down there  And their green salsa for dipping chips is amazing
5,"This is a great QT for when youre driving through Phoenix on I17 Its right off the freeway so its perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack

Plus its a QuikTrip there isnt really any part of it that isnt awesome"
5,flemings is always top notch we went for the thursday night wine tasting 20 wines for 25 introducing there new 100 wines by the glass The selection was good from lite whites to deep reds a great way to sample a portion of there new wine list then to top it off we received 25 gift cards for dinner so we stayed and had the AZ resturant week pre fix dinner for 39 the food was wonderful salads soup lamb chops and filet i guess to sum it up you cant go wrong with a meal from flemings they also have a great happy hour
1,"oK first i broke my promise to myself and went here again i figured by now things have got to be better i ordered something that i wouldnt care if it was cold French Toast ok so the french toast is good but it wasnt worth waiting 40 fucking minutes to get it and on top of it my friends food was cold again one of them would rather eat glass then eat at this place so refused to order a cold meal but since my other friend was paying she said fuck it ill go

well she ordered toast and some sausage as sides and my other friend ordered the mish mash his review of the place is more generious then mine but hes only been there once and said it wasnt so bad lol

so anyways toast soo cold the butter couldnt even melt and cold sausage to boot the friend with the mishmash lol i saw the bottom of the bowl and it was all a weird watery substance at the bottom how hard is it to drain poached eggs before dumping them in a bowl

i was going to give palatte 3 stars based on the french toast but it was hardly warm i so badly want to like this place cause its close and Matts is always packed

can i please get a breakfast place in the roosevelt area that is large enough to seat more then 20 people and serves good breakfast"
5,"I really like this place and I must say its the best pizza I have had West of Chicago  The sauce is on the sweet side but I like that  Its kid friendly so its a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it

The lines can be a little long at times but I think its worth the wait"
5,Green is by far one of my favorite restaurants to eat at  My husband loves it too and he is a carnivore  Our favorite things to get are the boneless buffalo wings and something that another customer shared with me while waiting in line that is not on the menu the Wendys pickle sandwich It is amazing  Another special they have from time to time is the big WAC and I must say it is better than the real thing
5,This is a must try for any Mani Pedi fan I use to drive to Scottsdale for all of my services until I found this spot Get the pedi no metal file pedi once  and you will NEVER go any where else Have fun I doCustomer service  top end Thanks
1,They have some rude employees its unbelievable Im trying to give business to them and ordered 6 smoothies and the cashier and her employee gave me a dirty look Not customer friendly At all
5,"I had the best culinary experience of my 8 years in Phoenix tonight First time at Switch Started off with some appetizers pesto  sun dried tomato risotto marinated chicken breast Mac n cheese All delicious  

Next my wife orders the blackened salmon I looked at her with my wtf scowl We dont even eat seafood It looks interesting she says Whatever It gets to the table and its the biggest hunk of salmon Ive seen We simultaneously stab into it with our forks take a bite and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love The combination of the salmon bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top 

We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 15 minutes Jason is touched by the hand of God He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrows dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night 

I never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod Got home plugged the iPod into the stereo and continued the concert danced with my dog and made me a latte  Perfect night  

Thank you Jason and Switch"
5,New to the Scottsdale area Ive been searching for a nail salon for a few weeks I stumbled upon this place and was very happy Although its in a weird strip mall its really relaxing inside My gel manicure was perfect and the shoulder massage was a nice added extra Totally recommend
5,"The pizza is incredible they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust

I want someone to mark that this post is funny so I will add a joke

Mushroom walks into a bar Bartender says sorry we dont serve your type here Mushroom says why not Im a fungi fun guy"
1,I really dont get why everyone is raving this place  Ive been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito  The portions are really small for the price that they charge  There is too much tortilla for the meat  I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley
5,RIP AZ Coffee Connection    I stopped by two days ago unaware that they had closed  I am severely bummed  This place is irreplaceable  Damn you Starbucks and McDonalds
1,"I have had it with the meat department at Whole Foods Market on Scottsdale Rd  the Mayo Blvd They really suck

I gave them another chance out of desperation really and they blew it  I am so disappointed  I purchased some turkey breasts there 3 of them at around 3000 for a 4 lb breast I came home froze two and cooked one It smelled but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats

I trusted his opinion and cooked it Upon slicing it up for dinner I found that the free range turkey was very fatty It was gross but no one got sick luckily

Well now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is It is definitely bad

And it gets even worse As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one I pulled out about 8 inches of thick fatty I dont even know what from it Lets just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too What ever that stuff is it is all gray and rotten

They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money I have had it with them 

I am not surprised They have always been trouble Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty I dont care attitude

I spent over 10000 there on Turkey ground  whole and he Frank still charged me for the breast bones  and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash

The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time It is really gross top dollar for top trash My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the questionable meat instead of throwing it out  

I am still nauseous from the smell sight and from touching all that gray rotting gross stuff BLEECH I think I ate that in the last one"
1,"just say no

this place is truly awful 
too bad its taking up valuable space on monroe"
5,"I am ready to update you to a five because the last three times I have been there your service has been better the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect I have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and I want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute 

If you were still serving breakfast at 6pm I would come eat you now"
5,I have passed this place for 20 years and had always heard good things Well one night when we were kidless we went It was pricier that we thought but we forgot the price once the meals arrived We were both very impressed Warm homemade bread Awesome salads I tried the escolar its a fish that a friend of mine loved but I had never tried it and it absolutely melted in my mouth My husband enjoyed his sausage and peppers We will definitely go back
5,"Once again Wildflower proves why its my favorite breakfast hangout Jeff the Manager on staff today rocks 

Some of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working mealand sometimes during that time Nature callsso I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue The busboy was upset that hed turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescueafter apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um overly proactive in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away

He handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table

Kudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone hereand to the couple who took my table if you are reading thisdid you REALLY need that booth I mean when I came out of the can there were like I dunno 5 empty tablesseriously Like did you propose there or something"

1,Food middle of the road The staff is rude Seems like it starts with the owner I think she makes the staff pay for everything that goes wrong so in turn they dont want to fix issues with poor wrong food etc  I think she tends to forget the customers are actually what keeps a business open For a long time it was the only choice in the area Now there are multiple choices  If your in the area Chilis or Connolys is much better choice in my oppinion
1,"If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars I might have  The chips and salsa are the ONLY thing that requires a star here

The service was less than average the food was hotter than the surface of the sun and the drinks were teeny tiny and didnt much taste like alcohol  My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red the server said nope thats what green looks like  WOW

Sorry but I dont think I will be returning"
5,I have been here many times pretty much cant go wrong here prices are good service is prompt and friendly
5,"As an artist Ive come to be very picky about the stores from which I purchase my art supplies Arizona Art Supply is a GREAT store Every time I visit I overhear the staffs experienced recommendations they take the time to ensure that every customers needs are satisfied 

I am always immediately welcomed as I delve into the fully stocked and wellorganized aisles Yes this is my kind of art supply store  As I browse the expansive selection of everything from  drawing supplies to paint easels and canvases to ceramic tools an overwheming desire to create comes over me AZ Art Supply has a HUGE selection of my favorite brandsPrismacolor and Golden Paints  

Although this store is smaller the prices are reasonablethey beat out Michaels prices for nearly every item If youre looking for exceptional quality a diverse selection and a knowledgeable staff Arizona Art Supply is your best bet"
5,"So yummy in my tummy My sister and I went here for dinner and the food was as always very yummy We had the marinated BBQ pork and the seafood hot pot at hot We finished half the of the plates because they give you a lot It would be better of the price wasnt as pricey But overall awesome service and yummy food We will be back

They first serve you lil condiment plates from seaweed to kimchi spicy marinated cabbage that has been fermentated When they serve you your food they will ask if you want egg in the soup of course They crack it in front of you in the sizzling hot soupdrools Serving you some extra rice for the soup and pork We had to pack to go boxes because it was a lot of food 

Today we went again for Fathers Day and our family agreed this was so yummy We had the BBQ pork again with Dumpling Tofu soup YumO Rachael Ray and Bibimbap with rice The Bibimbap was okay but everything was excellent Our family of five finished nearly everything D so GOOOOOD Going to come back soon 

Check this place out"
5,LOVE the food
5,"I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their backoffice staff

First and foremost talk about a professional classy organization Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman No matter what questions I have he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like Im bothering him 

The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesnt want the chance to purchase discounted tickets 

The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously You wont be disappointed"
5,These guys helped me out with my rear windshield wiper  They could have just shrugged their shoulders and said they didnt have the part but they worked with me and tried a couple of different options until we found a solution  Everyone I encountered was great
5,Eating in is a decent experience but for delivery I have yet to meet their match  When I order delivery I always get a 16 chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times  Its always tasty fresh and is my preeminent food for delivery ever period
5,"I love boba drinks but hate the word boba I always feel like an ape when I say that word 
 
Anyways

There was a period where I use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when I was living in San Francisco so when I say I love something I really do or is it more like a creepy obsession So When I found a boba place here I got excited especially when I saw that they had green milk tea

I cant vouch for all of their drinks as Ive only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow but every time I have ordered them they have been super good"
5,I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cakecupcakes Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 12 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available I met Jennifer about a month prior my fiance and I knew we wanted a peanut butter  jelly cake and she happily obliged I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried She went above and beyond my expectations The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations I highly recommend Cake Frenzy she is professional she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable
5,"Love it

Last night I dropped into Romanellis for the first time after driving past a time or two  Glad I did

Its a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats cheeses and breads  They also sell all things culinary Italia  

When I stopped in it was 3040 minutes to close  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try  I opted for Georges Special ham capicolla salami mortadella pepperoni provolone and hot peppers  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh  The sub is easily the best Ive had  Amazing

I also purchased a cannoli  Im picky about these things  Too many places fill em and stock em and the filling makes the shell soggy  Romanellis fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark NJ until last night the best cannoli Ive had  The cannoli was top notch  Simply the best

Right here in Phoenix on one night I had one of the best meals ever  I cannot wait to return  I only open they were open past 6pm"
1,One stop has one goal and that is to get the 80 diagnosis fee and split  Francisco told me i needed to spend over 1300 for parts the manufacturer only charges 316 for Stay away I intend to file a complaint with the Attorney Generals office today hopefully they will stop this nonsense
1,"this another place that i would give no stars to if possible 
its been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases and even more impressive because i dont know a single person who goes there

i went in there one time for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars Ive ever seen for some reason its right by the door instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables

after seeing that first off i wouldnt dream of ordering food here the place is also dark and dirty and theres never anyone inside of it

seriously Im really curious how this place survives awesome little neighborhood wing and live music joints like long Wongs get torn down for high rise condos yet gross ghost town ruby Tuesdays hangs on the corner of main and main of Tempe what is wrong with the world"
1,1 star for service but the food is not ok  they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco I let that go  figured was a mistake When I went again ordered different item  same result Little to no meat I will not be going back
5,"My Fiance and I went here today for the first time We shared a meat pie
and a serving of the largest  Bosnian Sausage dish 
     ALL of it was amazing I cannot speak highly enough of their food Service was very prompt and the waitress courteous and quick The food was very reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was very charming and nicely decorated All over the ambiance was pleasant I look forward to returning"
5,"Buckle is a really cool store  They carry both men and womens clothing and they have a huge selection of jeans  From Silver to Lucky theyre all there  

They also have really cute tops from casual to dressier ones you could wear out to a club or bar  Its nice because this store has its own stylekinda casual a little funky but definitely different than anything youd find at Macys or Nordstroms  

They also carry some shoes and accessories and the staff is really helpful  Youll also get a little punch card with your first purchase and after so many punches youll get 10 or 15 off

The clothes range in price but generally Id say everything in the store is pretty reasonable  This location is in Paradise Valley Mall check it out"
5,Like others I found this studio through a Living Social coupon  It is a great studio  Kim is so friendly and fun  I would highly recommend the yoga classes  They are both challenging and relaxing  It is a small studio but that gives it a really nice intimate feel  I definitely recommend it
5,I freakin love this place My favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused Now thats just funny My first time I was the same way like what the hell do I do here Now Im a pro Stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing Soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook Mmmmgood
5,"If you want to go back to the future at the movie theater Silver Cinemas is the place for you I felt like I was in the 1980 the decor LITTERALLY says it all I kid you not I am as frugle as the come and you get  more than you pay for here 300 everyday except for tuesdays 150
have I mentioned the minnie arcade Epic place to relive your childhood on date after drinks next door "
5,"Until Bobby Qs entered my life i wasnt a fan of BBQ anything made me kinda sad to see so many people enjoying some messy ribs but anyways I i digressThis place has changed my life for the better Their St Louis ribs are fall off the bone AMAZING and their Mac n Cheese is a must have I have to admit this place has made me a bit of a ribs snob if something doesnt come close to Bobby Qs i automatically right that place off

A short review but you get the gist of it"
5,"WOW this place is good  SO good  And not just yummy good but intrinsically good  Check out their amazing list of environmentally responsible business practices  httpessencebakerycomessencebakeryenvironmentallyfriendlyshtml   

That and its cute  And it tastes Yummy  And they are SO nice  SOOO nice  And their deserts are just disgustingly cute and beautiful and freaking good  I almost bought the mini box of 4 cupcakes for just 350  Bite sized so not too bad but if I bought them today theyd be gone before I got home 

I got their grilled cheese w mozzarella basil and tomato on grilled buttery brioche bread with a light and tasty green salad on the side  It will be hard to not come here every week  I love that all the drinks are refillable  and its up to you to refill them  Coffee tea or soda just walk on up and fill your glass  And I love that its all so fresh and local  

Important note  You order at the counter they give you a number and bring out your food  If youre paying w debit card they will ask you if you want to include a tip  That threw me  Id been in the place less than 2 minutes  how do I know if its worth the tip  or how much of a tip its worth  Bring some cash or plan to deal w that question accordingly"
5,What a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall  Would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino  He is world traveler so its a  must try if its the best cup hes ever had  He was right  Dont know if its in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top  My hubby and I loved the caramel brulee taste  My son loved the hot warm cocoa  Yeah we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd  Everyone was really friendly though The sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude   We will be back
1,"I was here for a conference and saw their sign for a 10 lunch special which wasnt available that day  Took over an hour to just get a lunch salad  The waiter had major attitude
Avoid this place"
5,Love it Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again YUMMY
5,"I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it  Must have eaten there twice a week minimum  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name they didnt  It was a different restaurant  

I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline and lo and behold there was Salazars tucked away in the Frys parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall  

The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices

I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce  Its pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort  Comes with pico and guacamole  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well I take Mountain Dew with my burritos"
5,I have now visited Herb n Flavors several times I love supporting local businesses who have sustainable practices This place uses local farms for their produce safe from GMOs and pesticides So I was already a fan before I walked in Everything I have tried has been delicious and the owner is such a cool guy always so friendly to the customers The food always tastes so fresh and full of flavor They have a little something for everyone I am a gluten free vegan and my husband has no dietary restrictions We always both leave happy I definitely recommend this place I would like to see their business continue to grow and stick around for a long time 
5,Tried them out for Restaurant Week  The food and service was excellent  I will certainly be back and loved the atmosphere We sat at a booth and very comfortably sat 3 adults  The wait staff was non stop on refilling drinks bringing more bread making sure the food was cooked to order
1,My family and I ate here just a few days ago It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine Once the rest of our party showed up at 1007 we were not seated until after 1030 When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults Well there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again Seriously We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess We all ordered and the food arrived quickly This was the only part of the experience that was good sadly to say We received our food order for 7 of us within 1520 minutes which was excellent My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast it was black not just black around the edges  The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather Overall none of us will be returning to this place It was is so overrated We are headed back to RANDYS here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast
5,"It does not get much better than this fellas

BS West is hands down the best gay bar in Phoenix

Friendly bartenders cheap drinks goodlooking crowd great musicits definitely got it all

Best night to check out is the obvious 241 Wednesday 

Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if youre into karaoke Saturdays are a nice alternative if you dont really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam its a different crowd

It definitely has a Cheers feeling to it not pretentious whatsoever Great patios too especially the back one with the new video screen they installed

Oh and their Halloween bash is THE party to be at 3000 people attended in 2007"
1,I was severely mislead by Frank As Its hot but the food aint bad review  It was very cold and by far the worst food Ive ever eaten  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return
5,I really like this place alot their pizzas are really different but really good I wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection Major thumbs up
5,"Sportsmans is on top of the game when it comes to wine The staff is more knowledgeable and helpful than any other place that I have bought wine at before I didnt feel like I was being judged for trying to find a cheaper bottle and there was no pretentiousness in the air While I was inquiring about dry resling one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar  and came back with TWO samples for me to try 

Sportsmans also has a very intriguing liquor section  I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of 

Several times a month they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled  They also have a full service restaurantbar off to the side where they have a huge by the glass list  you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store they cork it free of charge and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner  

The portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them 

My one complaint is petty their website  Its overrun with text and finding important information is difficult it also needs to be better updated with their amazing tasting events"
5,Alright went back last night felt bad because we were the late nighters and everything was perfect  The pizza the salads and the wine were all so well done  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone  OMG amazing  Im currently craving it the day after  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love
5,I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite  They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink  I LOVE their sugar free avalanches
5,This is one of  best libraries I have ever been to  I live very close by and it is very easy to stop by to pick something up or drop something off  This is always a must visit before road trips to California to pick up books for the adults and kids as well as DVD s for the road trip  We visit this location at least once a week and the kids love it
5,Loved the burgers and the onion rings were fabulous  This place is a must visi if you are in the Phoenix area anytime soon
1,"Would have to agree with Rana A below I think she said it best

Actually I had several folks tell me this place was lousy before I went it even fell below my already low expectations

Given that I just left the real Barcelona in Spain part of me was truly crying inside that night OK I gotta admit everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona the city and they say you mean the one in Scottsdale there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back"
1,"when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid therefore i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends

well i hit the jackpot 15 coupon for a FEAST the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get a huge steak shrimp and lobster PLUS 2 sides there were 3 of us this was PLENTY 

it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes not even lying if that says anything about the crowd for you

our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend then back at the waitress ill have a diet coke

then our waitress writes it down and doesnt say anything but looks at my other friend

i lost it and started laughing why isnt she talking to us this is so weird 

we ended up asking for a different waitress then found out the coupon was a big fat liar you didnt get all of that it just says you do but you dont the food ended up being nasty probably one of the worst meals ive ever had 

as were leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldnt control laughing 

awful food awful service AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in 

if walmart ran a restaurant this would be it"
5,"Our company held our fourth annual user conference here and compared to our previous venues this one was a smash hit in terms of facilities  It compares particularly favorably with the doudy sour old St Francis in San Francisco a venue I hope we never book again

The standout quality of this place is the hustle and quality of the service  Our opening night reception included an array of food service stations with different themes including a noodle bar that was particuarly well done  The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable attentive extramile oriented staff  They were reading the nametags of our 200 guests and calling people by name whenever possible and chatting us up in line to make sure we were all happy

The event coordinators were all over the venue throughout the ensuing two days  Where at the St Francis we struggled with temperature and electrical problems and grumpy uncooperative disinterested staff here at the Fairmont the very few glitches drew aggressive responses by people who cared about our event"
5,Nooooooooo  Curse the the gods of all that is delicious for Huauchinango is now CLOSED  Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas thanks for that  So not only did you replace a great eatery but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound  So I dont think Ill be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon  Huauchinango you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory You shall be missed
5,This is my favorite hotel of all time so far at least of the Kimpton ilk I experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed organic and local products a lovely shower and general happy relaxation I love that the gym and pools are open 24 hours a day The decor half Asian deco and half Southwestern works works works
5,"Hands down my favorite coffee shop in town They used to be located inside the Conspire art collective but have now moved into the old Hood Rides digs up the block and its awesome

Plenty of seating room at the bar and also a really cool little room next door  where you can pull up a seat and hang out From what I understand there will be seating outside too

Most importantly however is the coffee They use a special mix roasted specially by Cartel Ill be the first to admit Im no coffee connoisseur but I do know this every drink Ive had no matter whos behind the bar has been perfect Not burnt not too sweet and not a hint of pretentiousness

Sooooo why go to Sword Bucks when you can get a better cup of coffee up the street Oh and for those of us who burn the midnight oil on more than a few occasions theyre open until 12am EVERY night"
5,Tacos tacos tacoshow can something so simple be this great Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny I have a thing for always trying the odd menu items so Ive tried the tongue tacos and cabeza headcheek burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu This place is rather small which makes it perfect if youre there with some friends or a special someone My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself Go to this place for some great authentic local and quite tasty foodprobably some of the best the east alley has to offer
5,"This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that  good This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill The cherry on top is the games they have to offer Bocce and Bags

Drinks
1 Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order made with VodkaGinger beer and fresh lime juice 
2 If you bring in your own pimp cup any size They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup

Food
1 VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing
2 Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that ive ever had so I highly recommend getting them"
5,Handsdown my favorite pizza place in the East Valley  I have been going to Sourdough pizza for close to 15 years and it is consistently delicious  I grew up in Mesa now live in Phoenix but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area  The decor definitely leaves something to be desired as they are in a stucco strip mall and their interior probably has not been updated  all that much in the 15 years Ive been there  But I could care less when the food and prices are this good
1,"HELLISH HELLISH SUMMER WEATHER March thru October
it hurts my lungs to breath

I couldnt get transcripts because I had a parking ticket I needed to pay
The problem is i DONT OWN A CAR I dont drive I dont even have a drivers license
 aside from that one minor incident

I paid 9000 USD a semester to receive a so and so education
I graduated with a magna cum laude I have attended other universities However I couldnt help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered

For example you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes

Business school was so and so a lot of repetition
Very little handson and help with internships
Way too much groupwork and freeriding
They do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events

Oh and professors rarely teach the courses
They have their teaching assistants teach us

Also there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes
 Junior year when you get admitted into the professional program the level of the classes and transition isnt too smooth

The campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if youre having trouble with classes usually lower level

There are not enough chairsdesks in some classes
The students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls

Also the classes dont teach you how to think critically which I think is crucial in college
Please dont waste your money especially those of you from out of state Its not worth it

Expect to wait in line wherever you go
ASU accepts way too many people
It would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them

Thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need
The advisors are walking advertisements of the business school
They are not informed enough to advise you

I got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level even after preregistration
I got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate

Tuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000  in Fall of 2007
Gross

One thing I liked was the student theatre performances The admission  was reasonable and quite entertaining

The College of Architecture and Environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security

ASU is not the most safe neighborhood
I have been approached by many shady people

do NOT live on campus Especially the dorms on north campus
They are beyond crappy and overpriced
You have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads
The freshman year experience bullsht they pull on you dont buy it
and Please PLEASE please dont move into Manzy Hall Manzanita 15 stores with triangular windows

I lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest rats unhealthy mold pot circulation most promiscuous place on campus

Again please dont bother wasting your money especially if your an out of state or international student 
Hope this helps"
1,"Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail No personal message on his answering machine at all Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does
I tried to call here  653pm tonight and againno one picks up the phone So fed up with flaky contractors Do they want work or not"
5,"Im not a fan of ice cream I just dont find it appealing and its too high in caloriessaturated fat However I do love frozen yogurt and ironically its much less fattening yet more satisfying At 25 calories an ounce Golden Spoons is the best around There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog You also can get more than one flavor combined They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from from gummy bears to lowfat brownies

Even though their yogurt is nonfat and low calorie adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles adds less than 50 calories or if you like fruit go with that"
5,"Phenom 
The food is always fresh and well seasoned A good selection of Tequila 
Every meal that Ive had has been just fantastic The carnitas and the fish tacos are very well prepared Its fresh the beans are fresh as is the rice 
It averages about 10 a plate but worth it This is how really good Mexican should be 
The salsa bar is excellent you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose All freshly made 
I cant say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish 
Decor is a somewhat minimalistmodern probably to attract a happy hour crowd They have TVs for your viewing pleasure 
Service is friendly and quick 
Ive only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale 
Good food You wont be disappointed"
5,"Bring a flashlight It is so dark inside you can not read the menu But the waiter was so well versed we just used his recommendations 

We all had filets cooked to perfection and served on a 400 degree hot plate They recommend the lobster mashed potatoes but did not feel they were worth the price tag

The wine list is extensive and expensive  If you are looking for fancy this is the place but we went after a round of golf and they were very accommodating  

Great special occasion dinner but not your everyday steak joint "
5,"These are the best most consistent donuts in the valley  I was always a fan of the Chandler location so I tried this location as soon as it opened  I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location

I dont care if people go to dunkin for the coffeea donut shop is about the donuts and I havent yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa"
5,"I moved from Philly this past summer and Ive searched all over the Valley for a GOOD Pizza After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia I love the hole in the wall vibe Just like home  The sauce is great and super tasty The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffyIts what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven I love it My husband and I order the pizzawing special The wings are so hot and spicy  we order the hot but it comes in buffalo and mild They have an extensive menu of pasta sandwiches and salads I want to try their Philly Steak next but for the time being I still make mine at home 
Every pizza place likes to say its New York Style but this place really does a NYC pizza Well the best nyc pizza youre gonna get in AZ Something about the water"
1,food is ok but service is very slow
5,Very delicious and friendly They do happy hour every day which is so great The sushi is always very delicious and the same with their entrees I love how close this is to my house We visit this place quite frequently
5,Oh YEAH Coming to Scottsdale I have used RedSeven in Tempe and Mesa and excited to know that they are coming to Scottsdale I work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in Scottsdale that I continue to brag to them about RedSevens Super Quick Service Getting the job done quick and right and guaranteed to be the fastest to get you back to work Oh and they talk to you so you can understand not computer talk Cant wait for Scottsdale
5,"Ive been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday

We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matts and then peruse the market before it got too hot  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime  I was amazed at how natural it tasted  There was nothing artificial about it it just tasted exactly like it should  These are very good very simple cheesecakes  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from all at very fair prices  YUMMY"
5,"The best gyro you will have in Arizona
or maybe anywhere

Love the grocery selection
Everyone there is really nice
And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like 6"
1,Have the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east Certainly doesnt taste like it and they charge double what they do back east too No thanks The search for a good bagel continues for now Ill just keep having them shipped straight from NJ
5,Ive been going to Jess  Chace Salon for almost 2 years now and she is nothing short of amazing  Cut color highlightsshe is my super stylist  If you are looking for someone to give you a new look or just revamp a style youre already in love with ask for her
5,i love this place very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on when i do this is were i want to be at some point in the night where else can i go and request the cramps ilovethisplace it makes me happy i suppose i should go on and on about what its like but i wont go and experience it for yourself
5,Hands down a great lil joint Gotta get the guac staff is awesome way cozy and great food
5,Maestro Chris Bianco whips up addictive sandwiches at his laboratory on Central Avenue Ingredients are local and superfantastic Check out what todays market sandwich is  if its ovenroasted pork buy it immediately Dont miss the rice pudding
1,"We went here for Mothers Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience  Good food good service good ambiance  We came back here for Fathers Day and had a very unpleasant experience the worst display of management I have ever encountered  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of computer malfunction they claimed but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering no food nothing  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait did I mention the restaurant was half empty I wonder why and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait she came over to our table did not properly introduce herself sat down and pointed to the manheld computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes  Really  Youre coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting  It was so rude and disrespectful she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that 

 Needless to say unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members or hires a new manager we will NOT be coming back here again"
5,"Okay I have found my new favorite home office  I dont have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done

Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wifi It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience  The environment is very relaxing music is not blasting so customers dont have to scream over each other and they have great big couches in the back  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo

The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get my 2 favs are Cappuccino at 275 and 375 for large Chai Latte  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug  I dont know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups

A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good  Can you tell I am a fan yet  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing  There was a nice bonus on the plate  Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home About 1250 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich"
1,I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory
5,This my favorite Chipotle ever Its so consistent and good No hormones in the meat makes this fast food an A for me Yum
5,"This place is amazing Absolutely LEGIT Some of the best shawarma and hummus in the US Zankou Chicken in LA is a close competitor The pita sandwiches are stuffed with delicious fresh meat traditional pickles and tahini or garlic dressing depending on preference Ask for their hot sauce to help spice things up even more And the Jasmine infused lemonade is crazy sweet but really good 

I love this place and have been a diehard fan for over 4 years now"
5,Stop everything youre doing and go get one of their brownies warmed up with an ice cold glass of milk Ill never be the same
5,Suffered a senior moment today Did the yelp check and thought this sounds goodthe drive was very dejavu and then I discovered whysee previous review lol but to updatethe volcano appetizer sedona roll and Mochi Icecream which I am becoming addicted to were all wonderful Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl fulla necessity for me The place was full tonight and I can see why Question is will I remember
5,great 3D Imax theatersee the Transformersvery spectacular
1,"Heres the 1 2 3

1 Great Food I love hot New Mexico style food Good job
2 They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers Unfortunately theyre all shitty
3 They could REALLY improve the service No Bueno 

Well be back for the food It might be take out next time though

41711 Update Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site More importantly I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant Good Food folks just get it to go To Bryan L and the rest of the gang over at ArribasGo EFF yourselves You get one star and NO more of my money Learn how to work Kid"
5,"This is my favorite haunt Whether it be St Patricks Day before a sundevil game or just a place to meet some friends for a quick drink Gavin and the rest of the peeps are great The food is the good whether out on the patio eating bar food or inside the dining room indulging in dinner 

This place will always be the primary place to grab a Guinness for me"
5,I had Thai coffee and thai fresh rolls It was good The vegetables were fresh and delicious Plans to visit again
5,Delish  authentic The serving was generous meat combo fed 2 The injera was good not too thickdoughy Spicy and yummy I would like to return and experience their coffee ceremony
5,Amazing clothing and fantastic deals As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful
1,My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try Huge mistake The food was literally inedible everything was either too cold or burnt to a char nothing tasted good We decided to try the desert and the cream puff Im unsure how you can mess that up was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out The smell of the flan actually made us gag we had such an awful time I complained to the manager She didnt even seem to care and gave us 20 off of a lunch we didnt even eat We were disgusted by this place and we will never ever go back Dont do it you will regret it
5,This will be a simple postI love indian food and this is HANDS DOWN the very best in Az The Chicken makhani is so buttery so savorythe Chicken tikka masala the best I ever had Service is always good the food comes out fast Its not super cheap since you have to pretty much order everything ala cart but it is worth it If you go on Friday or Saturday there is also belly dancers When in rome
5,"The BEST of the BEST

I agree with Daren C  Killer Burgers Steaks Prime Rib and of course ribs

Food melts in your mouth  Make this your next restaurant stop  You will not be disappointed"
5,One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls   1 I am a HUGE champagne fan 2 You can smoke on the patio 3 the drinks are great and 4 I LOVED the decor and atmosphere  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out  The staff as a whole were awesome everyone was very polite and sweet  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses  The DJ was great as well fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service Yay
5,"After reading the great reviews and getting plenty of recommendations to try Fez I had the awesome opportunity to test it out last night at my first Yelp event and I am in love  From the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service I mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time this place is 5 star  

I love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends  This would be a great spot for dinner drinks or even an event another Yelp event please

Highlights
Tasty drink menu
Fabulous wicker tables and trendy IKEAish style
Great part of town
Sexy serversdang

Impress someone Take them to FEZ"
5,"Yes it is small yes it takes time to get your order but the quality of the food serve is excelent  Celina is the name of the owner not Selena of this fabulus resturant  She takes your order runs to the kitchen and then she serves your order too I wouldnt say that this is a one person resturant because she has help in the kitchen  
Very few Mexican resturants in Phoenix serve food as good as this one The Menu is limited but whatever you order you will not be disappointed"
1,Service was horrible and food was mediocre at best wont be going back
5,Cant go wrong with an iced gingerbread latte hot waffle with Nutella spread and free wifi  especially shared with my beautiful wife 
1,Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone
5,"Yup Im reviewing a gas station I like the Quiktrip chain in general and this station in particular

I find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town Sure the Arco sign down the street might say its 2 centsgallon cheaper but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge not to mention theres all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop

With Quiktrip the place is well lit theres always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump the convenience store is better than most and unlike most other gas stations they dont charge you for the air compressor Oh and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door while managing to sound sincere about it Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what 

Bonus for those of you who enjoy shopping at the Hot Chick Safeway down the street this is the Hot Chick Gas Station"
5,Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open  Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup  They may be closed for good  Not sure
5,"Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix Theyre real and theyre spectacular 

Of course being allnatural one is just a slight bit larger than the other but this is barely noticeable Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa whose nipple er summit is at 2608 feet Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points not to mention views of the city 

Although Camelback strikes me as a funner climb I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that dont go up to the summit which look to me to be worth exploring some day

Speaking of female body parts the former name for this peak was Squaw Peak This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state Native Americans are offended by the term Squaw and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word it is basically the equivalent of terms such as Negress or Jewess In the 1990s the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism Barry Goldwater The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea Theyd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans rather than honoring one of their finest citizens

And so in this decade Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue She gave the sqawapologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa after Lori Piestewa the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquelyArizonan Hopi Nation A fitting end to the debate

NOTE Even more fitting the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak and I swear to God Im not making that up to be funny"
5,I just love Chipotle Fresh yummy spicy if you want it to be And the restaurant was clean a HUGE plus My personal fav is the chicken burrito no rice no beans w fajita veggies pico cheese sour cream and lettuce Guacamole and hot sauce on the side So delicious The person who did our order was so nice It was my friends first Chipotle experience She was impressed by how big the burrito was Im glad I only live a few blocks away because I will be back
5,"I love you Marquee Theatre 

Just last night I saw Dashboard Confessional here and it was packed 
I have seen many shows here and I have not a single complaint about The Marquee The bartenders are really friendly the bouncers do a great job and the bands they have play here are always phenomenal Not to mention the sound guys do an awesome job 

I love how big it is in the Marquee because it allows for tons of people to see a great show One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there 

The only thing I hate and this has nothing to do with The Marquee itself is that I am always standing next to belligerently drunk annoying girls who cant seem to keep their mouths shut during a set Please dont speak I am listening to Chris Carrabbas angelic voice thanks 

All in all I think that The Marquee Theatre is my favorite venue of all time"
5,"Their food was GREAT I had the pancit lumpia and that purple rice The price was not bad for the amount of food that they gave you

Even though they had a very long line they were still very fast with service"
5,"FINALMENTE

Andiamo

FOOD

Appetizer Fritto Misto which is a trio of fried appetizers For the day ours included a cheese a stuffed olive and whole leaves of broccolini The cheese wedge was great I wish I remembered what it was and have you ever had a deep fried vealstuffed olive Very interesting The flashfried broccolini took a little getting used to since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them but still tasty if subtle

Main Orecchiette alla Puttanesca Man This is the real deal Orecchiette is the little ear pasta and alla puttanesca means its made whore style 

And what a beautiful classy yet very vibrant whore she is

The pasta was cooked just perfectly and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta spaghetti linguini etc it worked really well with the orecchiette 

And the sauce Holy mother this streetwalkin hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients capers breadcrumbs anchovy sauce garlic olives basil olive oil and uh the other 5 The flavors were a perfect clearheeled harmony Nothing overpowered the other Subtle and humble home food It really tasted just like something my Italian friends mothers would cook in their kitchen

As for the servings when I first got my bowl I was thinking oh ok this is a European serving Im still going to be starving after this And um nope Why Because I slowed down I savored my meal and took my time with the dish And by the end was I hungry Not at all I really enjoyed this meal And the serving was just right Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table 

SERVICE

Very friendly efficient and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table 

And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable Everyone looked happy excited and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business And I felt the same for them 

SETTING

I would say the space was just the right size Not a cavernous place in the least Probably the same size as Sens maybe  even a little smaller Its tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it But I like it a little hidden off actually 

The colors inside are warm with a modern bistro feel No windows looking outside but I didnt mind that There is seating at the bar a few twotops up front and larger tables in the back Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whorestyle it worked 

I definitely dont think this is going to be as sceney as Sens It has a completely different vibe 

EXTRA CRIB NOTES

 the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta No veal parm here And no hoikey sauces like Olive Gardeny alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego
 Its great
 Prices for antipasti range from 711ish and mains 11ish to 18 I spent around 26 with tax and a nice tip
 its great
 No liquor license yet For now sparkling waters lemonades a number of sodas including root beer  cream soda 
 its great
 complimentary valet awaits the diners if youre averse to parking close by yourself
 its great
 Its open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends What more could you ask for
 did I tell you its great

ALL IN ALL

An awesome asset to the area and Im very content And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I cant wait to try them all 

Im wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open A few minor kinks to be worked out and I wasnt as into the appetizer as I was my entree so its not totally perfect but they have started out very strong and its only Day 2

And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over ok more like 455 and rounding up"
5,"This has by far been my favorite movie theater and favorite movie chain in Arizona  This location is better than the others I have been to  quieter friendlier staff  The theaters are clean and usually not packed either

I love the tshirt and cup program  and buying tickets at Costco  I went to AMC last month and spent a lot more money all the way around and did not like the theater either"
5,"If youve read some of my other reviews youll see a trend 

Kohls Department StoresBrewers spring training 

Yep Im a cheesehead But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head shoot me Really 

What can I say I like Culvers It reminds me of home Its total comfort food 

Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh And tasty 

Culvers is known for their frozen custard What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culvers looked at their sign checked out the flavor of the day and gone Hey that sounds good and quickly pulled into the parking lot 

If youre from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custardit will bring back lots of good memories 

Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or somethingwellthats the whole charm behind Culvers You DO feel like youre in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states 

Granted Im not the best person to review CulversIm a little biased towards it But if you want a different kind of fast food experience and youve never been to the upper Midwest its a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there 

Give it a chancesee if you like it"
5,"Lets be honest when you walk into a tanning salon if you have high hopes youll expect to see a nice person behind the counter who is friendly and can tell you the prices for packages and the max times on the beds  If you have low expectations youll expect a bored teenager who hands you a price sheet and stares at you looking bored

Walking into the Total Tan I had pretty good expectations based on the reviews and even those were blown away  Dallas was the person who helped me I think hes one of the owners and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually

I had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons Id been to had ever told me  He was super personable too even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything  He made sure I knew every detail of the beds the differences gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I dont think he had to ask for their names once a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers

I could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself super clean trendy nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels but I think you get the point by now  Just check this place out youll be happy you did"
5,"This place really made a terrible situation as easy as possible  Our cat was hit by a car or beaten and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain  We rushed her to the clinic and the doctor saw her right away  She told us our options but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did  She didnt pressure us one way or another and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it and they gave her some immediately

Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation"
5,"OK yeah everyone LOVES teriyaki we know

Well dont so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here  It may look like a little preprocessed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside but theyre a die hard homemade mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment

Id highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ yet they have an excellent one thats very traditional but not too expensive Id love to explain the mystique of this dish but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet thats coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable  Well to them I say you should educate your tongue and expose it to some delicious culture 

Theres also Orange chicken This dish is completely the bees knees It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers

Their house beef Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms Heaven  Simple and delicious

And I havent even mentioned their coup de grace yet  Their fried rice might seem a little heavy on the surface as its lightly fried with some garlic oil but it outclasses all competitors  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp its sweet garlic love  Seriously their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices

As Ive been eating here for far longer than Id like to admit Id have to say I might be a little biased  But for the great unique quality and cheap price I guarantee youre not going to find any better in AZ"
5,"I first heard about gangplank at the Arizona Entrepreneurship Conference last year  Since then I have been a regular there and the people that cowork or work there are some of the most inspirational ones I know and are passionate about bringing startup culture to Phoenix area  

The companies that anchor Gangplank are always working overtime to plan events from Gangplank Jr for kids to learn programming to the Wednesday brown bag talks that have ranged in topics from how to pitch to angel investor to a local news anchor talking about how they are using Twitter as a resource for news leads

Gangplank rocks  Nuff said

5,"Im President of the Local scooter club so I know and deal with most of the dealers Valley Wide Tylor the GM and team run a good shop Very friendly Dont get me wrong they are there to make money but they are not push You are free to hang out and ask lots of questions Good assortment of accessories and they can pretty much get anything

They know bikes and parts inside an out Service on my Piaggion BV500 has been fast and fantastic I did not say cheap but fair  Actually they had a Buy 1 tire get the 2nd for 1cent event this week In the past they had a 12 price on all their helmets Got a Scorpion 220 helmet for about 110 Just ask what and when they are having specials

I dont buy the review below about bait and switch pretty serious accusation However GoAZ and Gina over there are good people as well"
5,Yep  still my favorite holeinthewall eatery awesomeness The brisket sandwich with cheddar and slaw and dippin sauce was to die for I ate at the bar and just enjoyed my visit  Cant wait til I can walk here
5,Having lived in Chicago for most of my life I was more than nervous of what an Arizona pizza experience would be like For the most part my assumptions were correct  but Grimaldis is great We get the margarita pizza and its amazing Im normally a deep dish pizza person but Grimaldis is slowly winning me over for thin crust Also this place has amazing cheesecake  the best Ive ever had in a restaurant
5,Everyone here is very helpful and friendly  No matter who I come in contact with I can tell they love animals and care about me and my pet  The vet calls me himself to discuss my cats test results  They also made sure to give me a lot of information regarding the medications they are putting her on  I feel that my family gets good care from this vet  We ended up moving about 15 minutes away but still make the trip to see this vet
5,No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out In and Out Man I love that place I think that says it all
5,"Video Paradise is great  For those who arent financially comfortable enough for the monthly payment to maintain a NetFlix account or when you dont feel like buying something from Amazoncom Video Paradise is a wonderful substitute if you want to get something that you know wont be at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video

The selection is staggering  I remember the first time I stepped in I was amazed  The only movie I really wanted to see and they didnt have was The Helstrom Chronicle but thats okay  Im not going to ding this place because they didnt have it  You didnt have The Helstrom Chronicle  Lame  I mean come on  No one else has it  

This place had it all from little indie films to grossout horror films I had long forgotten from my disturbing adolescence Cannibal Holocaust Faces of Death etc  They even had the worst movie Id ever seen in my life  Hard Rock Zombies

The décor is that of sheer unbridled love for cinema  You can easily spend hours and hours browsing through their selection"
5,"Weekend plans prevented me from kicking off AZ Restaurant Week on Saturday So on Monday Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped

We started out with the spinach artichoke dip The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip Ive ever had the honor of putting in my mouth OMG Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness But when you hit a home run so soon in the game the rest of a meal can seem at odds

However I was not daunted She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes with good gravywhat exactly is that and roasted carrots I the blackened Mahi back story to follow topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous We didnt share our protein but we sampled each others sides All were very good but the carrots really stood out The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish we both hit the wall A food coma was certain I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots

Then came the white chocolate brownie So sweet so rich so topped with vanilla ice cream It was all we could to to make a dent in it We both felt bad because isnt white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient 

Regardless this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles Having about 42 myself I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read SWAG after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff Really super sorry if that creeped you out Its actually WCG

 When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit we went to a restaurant the listed Dolphin as one of its menu items I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin to which the server responded it was actually Mahi Oh I responded Then Ill have the veggie burger Because even in 1998 I was a food bitch"
1,I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it served in a aluminum takeout box The tables are folding tables like the kind you play beer pong on And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too which has nothing to do with AsianMexican cuisine it creeped me out
5,"I am so not a fan of the dentist  But Dr Ito and his staff changed that  Professional yet relaxed attitudes  From the moment you book the appointment to the time you leave you feel like are well cared for and that you arent just a number or a dollar sign

While in the waiting area I flipped through Dr Itos Smile book that shows some of his work  WOW  He makes teeth look real not like Chiclets  He does some fabulous cosmetic work  

I went in to have a crown put on and it was quick and painless So quick that I didnt get to finish watching the movie   Each chair has headphones and a flat screen that shows a movie he keeps a good stock of the latest movies  Whod have thought that going to the dentist would keep me so entertained

Ive had to bring my son to each appointment as I havent had anyone to keep him  Does that matter Nope  Dr Itos office is equipped with a childrens area in the back where the kids can watch a movie read a book or play a game  He thinks of everything

I have been recommending him to everyone I meet  I cant say enough good things about Dr Ito and his staff  You wont regret going to the dentist if Sonoran Hills Dental is your new dental office"
5,The best tai in downtown for the price Masiman is the most tasty dish here
1,"Totally dissapointed  I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo to try out this restaurant which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE  
The Service was great but the food not worth it  The restaurant itself is very outdated very 80s  
My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer  They were cold when they were served  We told our waiter who in turn told the chef and the message was passed back to us that she appologized   
My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for 2995 6 oz of that was pure fat  and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat  I ordered a wild mushroom pizza which was OK   This place needs an over haul in a major way if they want to make any money at the restaurant which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went was empty  I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet"
5,Man I love Southwest  Best airline ever  After a bunch of holiday delays on my way home from a business trip they comped us all a round of drinks  Its nice to have an airline that can give you a glass of wine to compensate for a one hour delay  Cheers to that
1,This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude It is 122112 I know Christmas time is tough for retail employees but I was at many other retail stores today and their mgrs and employees were extremely friendly I spend approx 12 hour talking to a sales assoc who was very friendly and all was good until I got to register with the mgr and I ended up walking out without purchasing anything I then went to my car and purchased desired items on amazon while in this storesparking lot I know business is good this time of year and maybe this companies business is always good But the post office and Sears also used to be the king I could explain all the facts of the situation but I am sure it would make no difference as I am confident this is the culture of this store
5,Excellent burger
5,Came here instead of Starbucks to get some much needed study time Its too hot for coffee Close to my university  Has all things berry healthy I personally ordered the Berry Fulfilling w a free energy shot Free Ill take berries and free any day My drink  all berry and only 150 mere cals filling Actually felt like dessert Awesomely sweet staff
5,"I have found my new favorite breaksfastlunch spot I love the much cozier and homey feel this place has as opposed to chains like Panera and Corner Bakery We stopped in at Wildflower Bread Company over the weekend because I had heard great reviews about their freshly baked loaves of bread We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow Instead we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case 

My fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it This said a lot to me because hes normally not a pasta person The salmon itself was really good  soft and flavorful I had the butternut squash ravioli  one of my all time favorite pastas  and WBCs version did not disappoint I loved the nutmeg flavor it had  perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb

It was a later lunch for us around 3pm so it wasnt crowded inside but there were still a good amount of customers so it seems to be a favorite Service was pleasant and fast and the menu has a wide variety of items that were excited to go back and try more"
5,I saw this place on a Food Network series in November When my family went to Phoenix in March for spring training I knew we had to stop here It was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car It was in a sketchy area in the town and far enough from the freeway When we were there the workers gave us samples of the different foods I got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor and the jade red chicken was also very good The snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy which was a good thing for me This will be a permanent stop in Phoenix for Spring Training trips
1,I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON than Circle K  because I wasnt paying cash or using a Shell credit card  Yes there are signs on the pump but really who would think to look for such a requirement  Ive been buying gas for over 40years and have never seen such a noncash penalty  I and my children their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again  How disappointing and dishonest
5,"This is the only auto repair place Ive ever seen with 5 stars solid and they totally deserve it

My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasnt run in several years After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and 1000 to the awful Meineke down the street he gave up until my cars transmission went for good and he decided to fix the Bird yeah so I could drive it yes I am super lucky

Whiteys diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel which is what Meineke charged 500 to replace hmmm Upon hearing the story of Meineke Whiteys told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and theyd put it in for just labor  Awesome

We took it home but it wasnt running quite right still and then failed emissions Back to the shop it went

Whiteys took it back spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things At one point they called and said Weve done this this and this and its still not quite right so were gonna keep it another day   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it versus just handing it back again but I was dreading the repair bill

We picked it up Tuesday The bill 7 Thats right  SEVEN DOLLARS They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter That is amazing to me  I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time  

The car runs beautifully now and they were extremely pleasant the entire time Im taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week I HIGHLY recommend Whiteys"
5,Ive rented from Captain Ted many times and even gone on one of his guided trips down the Salt River He is helpful and very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend renting here
5,"Have I got a place for you unhealth conscious frugal foodies out there  Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices and much of the food is homemade Theres also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks for instance theres over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from Dennis one of the owners worked for AW for 8 years so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now 

     I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries then did a little research The reviews I saw were all stellar so I knew we had to give it a try It doesnt look like much inside or out  its in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave and Cactus But its clean and everybody is helpful and pleasant Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds 249449 on the menu We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us The curds came quickly out of the kitchen piping hot served with some tasty homemade marinara They were a touch greasy as they should be and the oil was fresh Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing 299 399 or 499 Ken had a homemademeatball  sub with more of that good marinara and some provolone It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches Marty went with a double burger 389 the singles are 1 less He could have opted for a Rocket Burger  0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain cheese bacon teriyaki or chili style 499 to 599 Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings

     Again our food arrived quickly served in plastic baskets It became very quiet except for the occasional growl of pleasure The onion rings 199 had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy  The handcut fries 149 were skinny the way I like them Randy thought they were undersalted but I thought they were fine  our usual disagreement At any rate they disappeared quickly Unlike the sandwiches They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious as was my whole wheat sub roll The meat balls were nice and tender and there was plenty of cheese on top Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it  instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening It never did tell you to turn it right side up again  the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve 

     Other food items available Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles 249 Pizza  
Bread with various toppings Gyros 369 salads 199  399 a fish sandwich 249 served with homemade tartar sauce And lots more I dont know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money but I surely do hope they continue and prosper"
1,not clean worst gel manicure ever and ruined my nailsJimmy finished it his wife started it  Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while theye filing sanding and cutting  They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail which causes it to catch and tear off the same day or soon  Their 10 or 12yr old daughter brought the colors to pick she is much too precocous to be customer focusedshes narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me  They have to open bottles to look at gel colorno samples  Gel drying machine is sitting on a priority mail box on top of chair in customer wait area   Pedicure okay  Wont come back  This place like many with Vietnamese want your money they dont understand service or cleanliness in this one and why we really come to these places  They also try and nickle and dime you on price for instance give you a deal to take off gel from previous manicure when youre getting a new gel manicure  They want to use the dremel to sand your nails down to the quick  How about healthy nails and return visit  This place Im surprised stays in business  Sadly its not in a category by itself although the others are cleaner  Jimmy should stay away from nails and customers and just keep quiet  The girl might be cute to some customers but I am not coming to have a 12year old wait on me  No thank you
5,Ive been going to La Canasta for as long as I can recall I live in Tempe and cant go as often as Id  like but I go at least once a month I love this Canasta because they have a green chile salsa and menudo every day Always quick and fresh I either get the ground beef tacos yummy the red chile burrito watch out or the menudo got a hangover It is very consistent and prices well it adds up but it is worth it I have yet to have a bad experience after 28 years
5,It cannot get any better than this my favorite is mix of banana  hazelnut and lemon It is quality stuff If you want something better fly to Italy
5,"Visited the phoenix public market  open air market  farmers market they have on saturday mornings and decided to give mojo bowl a try They are at the market for food truck fridays also Check out their website for their usual schedule They can take cash or credit with square

I tried their strawberry banana smoothie and my wife had the Funky Monkey peanut butter  chocolate blend They were both great quality with fresh ingrediants They serve salads yogurt parfaits and soup also which I didnt try but Ive heard their smoothies was where they shine and they did not dissapoint Give them a try at 500 for a 24 oz smoothie you cant really complain about the price  its basically a meal itself"
1,"Bad customer service  

No one at the front desk for thirty minutes  Plus they left the phone on the counter so when I tried to call their number phone just kept ringing and ringing  "
1,"Whats with the cheese  It isnt even Velveta  Its liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger

5 burger and fries is a great deal IF  IF  its a great deal  This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty  McDonalds will do a burger and fries for 5 thats tastier than this dump"
5,"what is it with me and pricey phoenix hotels i swear i dont just give out fives willy nilly or do i have any particular adoration for phoenix  sorry phx 

I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics which happen to be my favorite team it was downright magical 

the decor was fantastic the rooms were huge with huge tubs a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc yaaaaay why dont more hotels do this 

the pool was phenomenal i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody marys and frozen drinks the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust 

The trader vics attached isnt so hot but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus room service too they make their own english muffins

If im comparing it to the royal palms the other phoenix resort i raved about its tough Royal Palms is better for chilling and families Valley Ho is better for singles Royal Palms is your wedding Valley Ho the bachelorette party Valley Ho had better food and more style but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service Really you cant go wrong with either 

What is it about Phoenix hotels all i know is i am no longer groaning when im sent on a business trip there"
5,This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot Phoreal Impeccable service and the freshest food Their spring rolls ate immaculate fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice and their pho is truly unphoghetable The servers are friendly the owner always asks you how the food was Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine
5,CASH ONLY  But we easily feed a family of 4 hungry people for less than 20 and its not Taco Bell  So with that being said the Grilled Pork 5 sandwich oh hell ya its good ringing in at only 285  The regular Turkey  Ham on a crossaint is about 425 and its the size of a small football great value you could probalby get by with the small croissant sandwich instead for  only 195 yeah its crazy cheap  Hot wings are generic prebreaded with a kick of spiciness   The steamed bun is sweet doughhowever not my favorite my husband and sister seem to love the egg and meat inside  The ice cream is all homemadealso another great deal at 99 cents for a cone check out the icecreamlooks crazy good  Dont miss out on taking home some baked goods the baguettes are crustysoft and warm when you get them  The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley  I did try and Avacodo bobahad to send it backnot sure what the heck it wasit was green but didnt taste anything like Avacado so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas  The Viet coffee also great kick for you mentally if you need a boost very strongvery good  Dont miss out on this place its a good go to place for a great lunch or snack
5,"Had a late night plumbing emergency last night Called a friend who recommended Kevins Classic Plumbing Within an hour the plumber was at my home repairing my problem At 1000pm my water was back on with kids taking showers toilets being flushed and my wife was talking to me again Sounds great right Gets even better The price they charged me for the after hours repair was the most reasonable ever Last but not least he was a heck of a nice guy Kevins Classic Plumbing will be my plumbing company for both home and work from now on

On another note I had called one of those companys that advertise on TV all day long They were not able to come out last night and when they did call me they indicated that it was probably not something they could fix and would most likely require a two man crew Thanks Parker  Sons"
5,The best fish tacos period  And I hate chain restaurants
5,This is hands down the best burrito in the East Valley Favs is always consistent and their prices are excellent My standard meal is a California Carne Asada burrito it comes with the most tender carne asada Ive ever had Also their green and red sauce is a step above the competition and they have great mexican rice it comes with peas and carrots Guac is exceptional and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day Five stars for being consistent clean and for having pleasant and professional employees One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10 Bummer but still the best
5,After a second visit the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor Quite a contrast to my first visit Still enjoyed the meal but wasnt as impressed with the chicken Ill have to go back to see if it was a fluke
5,"I would be beside myself if Grinders closed Its about time I wrote a review since Im a regular I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wifi many mornings

Im the one who brought the plants in I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays Im lazy and they really need to be repotted I should get on that 

The music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink  theyve continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat  calories of my regular order Now its an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla I used to get an Everything bagel with egg cheese and potatoes most mornings Now I get it on multigrain toast Eh its the little things

The coffee at Grinders is really really good Its not bitter and sharp its smooth They grind their beans outside many mornings per week Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open but if the grinder is going outside itll blow coffee bean fumes in the door

Theres some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together They call themselves the Geezerados

Theres sometimes a few rightwingers having conversations midday One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isnt happening so they could use that as their hook

A lot of moms come in with their kids Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day Im not there all day but Im there at all times of the day because I have a home office and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine

Early in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others eyes 

Ordinarily Im a real talker and I cant usually keep my mouth shut but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep I just eavesdrop on everyones conversations and sometimes run into friends I know I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning thats part of it For the record a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there because I was so quiet

Theres nothing pretentious about Grinders at all and its also down to earth without being ghetto It has character Some months the art is better than other months Hannah has been there for years they call her Big Hannah now only because theres another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever 

I can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye Thats the beauty of Grinders Ive seen other people come in wearing their pajamas too Its a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other

Grinders has a location inside the John C Lincoln hospital across the street too Its common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs I think theyre also opening one at Devry or they just did I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there LAME"
5,In my opinion one of the best steakhouses in town  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal  The service is the best just like their steaks  I recommend the Caesar salad fillet creamed spinach cream corn garlic and lobster mashed potatoes  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here
5,We have been here many times in the last 10 years The Stetson Salad is the best salad I have ever had The combination of sweet crunchy savory and acidic is perfect to me Lately I have also tried the Scallops on Beet risotto The scallops are great but the risotto just doesnt work though I love beets and I love risotto  I have of course had the mushroom stir fry which is very good but very hearty and heavy Soups have been excellent The current best desert is that peanut butter brownie But bewareit is really rich and sweet I also enjoy the wine flights here Most recently I took my 8 and 11 year olds at lunch Though they were the only kids there they thoroughly enjoyed the Kobe beef burgers This is still my favorite place in Old Town
5,This place literally just opened  I didnt really know what to expect but when I walked in the doors I was immediately greeted by Nick and he was very nice and down to earth  This is a shop for people who like to gardengrow plants hydroponically or in the ground They have all kinds of gardening supplies and Nick said they will be receiving their seed shipment from Seeds of Change any day now  I will definitely be back as my green thumb or lack thereof has been sparked  PS I was informed that the in the next issue of the New Times Grotown will have an add to clip out and bring in to save 20 Yay plants
5,"FnB is how every restaurant should be Unfortunately this will not happen because Pavle Milic who runs the place cannot be at every restaurant 

This is a small friendly restaurant in my hood that just happens to have some of the best food you will find I always feel welcomed  taken care of by the staff Ive come here with friends but Ive also come alone  felt totally welcome I like sitting up at the counter and Ive actually met some really great people to chat with there Pavle  his wife run the place  they are the kind of people who always make you feel like they are glad you are there

Chef Charlene does things with food that make it amazing  these are things that I myself could never accomplish My main cooking skills involve a microwave or a menu I just wish I had the funds to eat here more often

In conclusion fabulous food combined with wonderful service make me feel lucky to have FnB in my neighborhood "
5,"I LOVE Laser for Less Chandler  If you are going anywhere else for Laser hair removal you need to stop now and call to make an appointment with Laser for Less Chandler   I wasted a lot of  at another Laser removal place before I found Laser for Less and now I am kicking myself for not going to them first  If you pay to wax any part of your body you should be lasering that hair off  It works better lasts longer and in the long run is cheaper  

Pros  
1 Free touch ups 1418 days after your first appointment if they missed 1 hair they will touch up for free  Never had a problem with them discouraging me in fact it was the opposite they give me reminder cards so I know when my touch ups are due  They encourage you to come in
2 They can also charge you by the laser shot instead of a whole area  So if you only have a few random hairs they will just charge 10 cent per shot on the legs or 70 cents on the face or smaller areas  You cant beat that deal
3 I am pretty sure they beat or match all prices in town
4 Once they laser the hair all your hair will fall out and wont grow back for like 2 months its better than waxing  Not all laser removal places use the type of laser that does this place does  That is why I recommend them it works a lot better
5 They actually care about getting rid of unwanted hair and will go over all their policies with you  Kristen is who I go to and she is great  I have been to almost all their girls and they are good 
6 In fact when it was my birthday month I didnt know I got some discount and they back credited me for it I feel like they are always trying to get me the best deal  
7 They always have deals  Just last month they had their underarm extravaganza where you can get your underarms done for 30 That is so cheap  They let you buy up to 3 sessions  I referred a friend and she loved it so much because she didnt have to shave her underarms the WHOLE summer  
8 I love Laser for Less CHANDLER

Cons  never having to shave again darn"
5,Excellent service and food  Best texmex in the valley
1,"The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service 

It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals 

Im not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer 

Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states the manager is off till next week 

i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard"
5,This store has the most pleasant employees of any Forever 21 I have ever been to The girls are always smiling and they take the time to esquire if you need help The other day I went in and an employee spent over 10 minutes helping me locate a particular skirt my sister wanted for Christmas
5,"I love cupcakes Its true I really do I have waited in an hour long line outside of Magnolia Bakery in NYC to experience the bakery that started the cupcake craze That said if there is a good cupcake to be had Im on my way to experience it I must note that I am not a fan of Sprinkles as I think they are overly dry and waayy too hyped

We just ordered two dozen different flavors from Mind Over Batter to celebrate our August birthdays its a tradition we do once a month from bakers around town Because of my love for all thinks coffee I got the Carmel Mocchiato Let me just say i wished I took a picture But I couldnt help but to dive in Mocha Buttercream frostingpiled high crushed coffee toffee and carmel drizzle 

I also heard rave reviews from the office about the Birthday Cake and the Chocolate Red Velvet The one I most want to try is the Lemon Drop because I love lemon

Ill be back in very soon to check out more flavors and cake pops"
1,This is my very first review and I cant say I feel bad for what I am about to write I took everyones review hoping for a really good hotdog and onion rings like the reviews I read best hot dog ever amazing hotdog etc oh man were we disappointed  Id have to say Id go to cocstco for a hotdog for 150 with a drink
1,"I went today to meet my daughter for lunch  We are both big sushi enthusiasts  The interior and atmosphere was beautiful  Well appointed
The service was excellent  We ordered edamame was goodnothing to rave about  Not much you can do to mess that up  Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got  Ordered five different sushi rolls
All five were bland not much flavor and stale  The fish was not fresh
Paid 12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old  Will not go back
Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three  My daughter says to give it another try  Well see Ill let you know if I do"
5,I love this place Everything about it The great food the grocery section the cramped seating it gives character It all goes together perfectly Havent found one bad thing yet
1,35 minutes No food You be the judge
5,Best Chinese food in the Valley As others have said salad dressing is addictive as IS available to take home in containers Shrimp dishes are outstanding with large plump high quality pieces of shrimp I have never had even an average dish here Go and enjoy
5,"Heres the deal I said I was done with OT but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot 

My friend was right

Everything I had a problem with before was remedied I went in unannounced didnt tell anyone about a previous bad experience and I was given some of the best service Ive received in town When we went in we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit

No texting employees no indifferent waitstaff The chef was in the food window expediting food making sure it went out promptly and correctly Not only was our server attentive but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks debris on the table etc 

The decor has been refreshed and although I didnt dislike the decor originally it is definitely an upgrade as well Now its much cleaner but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before 

Props to the new management Well done Ill be back

PS  forgot to order side syrup Curious to see if they still charge 2"
1,"I am not a fan of this place I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial positive sandwich

Top Bun The location is fantastic I really like where it is its a cute little place that is very easy to find

The Meat of the Matter The food here is odd I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures As I have mentioned in other reviews I love all types of food from all over the world I didnt care for this place I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray It wasnt good The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didnt try it 

Lettuce onions pickles tomato The service was not good I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part The bartender who i believe doesnt work there anymore luckily sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar probably pickledpreserved veggiesmeatfruits etc it was unappetizing to be aroundI dont have a weak stomach at all it was just odd The second time I went in the service was equally as bad there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes Subsequently the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes

Bottom bun I like the owner he is really nice and friendly The cooks were also friendly I like to believe that my taste buds merely didnt care for this place I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things I personally have not had a good experience with this place but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have"
1,"If it wasnt for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year  The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie I order a salad only Because they do catering I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers  

The service is OK They have a couple of generic draft beers Everything is overpriced  Caveat Emptor if you order an entree"
1,This was absolutely horrible I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats  I threw it in the trash I will wait until I get to my destination to eat Horrible
5,Have alread posted a review but had to add that a friend at work ordered vegan chocolate cupcakes for my birthday and they were sooooooo delicious All my nonvegan coworkers LOVED them
1,"Yeahnotsomuch

Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait  Or the chaos Or the hype Or the attitude from the morons who work there Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include

 The cupcakes are not that great I ordered two The vanilla was okay the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it

 This place is a disorganized mess 

 There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes Just stupid

 The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions No sane person could possibly work here without being like umthere might be a better way to do this

 Also the employees were rude Did I mention dumb

So get this I attempted to order a bottle of water I told the clerk its 100 degrees outside I walked there and Im realllllllly thirsty The idiot at the counter told me You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasnt anyone currently paying or using the register Couldnt she just sell me a water She said NO and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER just the word water on a cupcake order slip She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up

I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLLTOTHENO 

I said Its quite simple Just hand me the water and I will hand you money End of discussion There are the actual words out of the mouth

She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 54 110 lbs of fury Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone 

I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion And Im mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes yo"
5,"The BEST SPORTS BAR in chandler hands down A great place to meet friends and even bring the kids The owners are always around to ensure ur experience TVs everywhere if you love sports and beer this is the place for you The nob has events all week and food specials to go along the ribs are amazing however the GYRO is good as it gets The best gyro in the valley you can write that one down and the wings once you pop u just cant stop

HOB NOB SPORTS BAR  GRILL cheers to you"
5,"Beautiful restaurant Terrrific service 

Wonderful fresh and authentic cuisine  what more can I say but dont miss the Carpaccio"
5,Ive always been treated well  Dambrosios despite my not exactly being N Scottsdale plastic 
5,Ben  Jerrys is still the best chain ice cream shop The employees are always helpful and polite and their flavors are just outrageous The smell of the waffle cones and waffle bowls wafts out the doors as you walk by and you cant resist Whether you go for new flavors or classics like Cherry Garcia and Phish Food you can expect the most flavorful ice cream with the perfect consistency
5,Did you know that Malees on Main offers cooking classes  They offer them twice a month during tourist season and once per month during the rest of the year  I attended two weeks ago and it was OUTSTANDING  Not only did we learn to cook Thai which incidentally it was significant to learn that Thai gets its flavor by layering is sauces but we were given the recipes for some of the signature dishes served tastings a meal and wine pairings and we were even given goody bags  It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie
5,"Even though Ive rarely had anything else on their menu except for hummus I highly recommend this little greek hot spot They have tons of regulars because the food keeps them coming back The hummus is to die for it only comes with one pita however so I always order 23 extra I have also tried their veggie gyro which is great I have brought many meatloving friends here and Ive never heard anything but great things about their experience with their food 

The staff is completely Greek They are friendly in their own unique kind of way Because I usually saunter in with a drink from Starbucks same parking lot the female owner assumes I work there and she always asks me how business is going at SB I corrected her the first few times but she continued to ask so now I just keep it going and tell her its going great but that I hate my job because Im assuming I would if I worked there I love her personalityvery intense Never smiles even when a smile would be just right But she is still very kind Always look forward to seeing her and eating her food"
5,I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 1130am or 12pm Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick and the Monte Cristo french toast instead of regular bread slices  delicious Service was friendly and attentive The dining area is decorated like a household very comfortable and clean
5,My husband and I enjoyed a staycation here for my birthday We had an amazing time We took advantage of the great happy hour specials at the poolside bar and at the Sangria bar The Sangria bar had billiards and a card table They also had a wonderful Happy Hour menu where everything is 5 Excellent hamburgers and margaritas We enjoyed a beautiful  dinner at Palm Court and a breakfast buffet at Vista Verde We took advantage of the free bike rentals and the exercise facility The staff was amazing and very accommodating They have definitely earned our business and will refer our friends
5,"Okay if you actually like the taste of good whole foods and fresh ingredients this place is an Oasis of goodness If your looking for a place that says they make natural foods but uses 2nd rate ingredients and comes up with recipes to hide the fact by using spices to cover it up your better off going somewhere else
My family took me here when we were visiting and it is wonderful I had the Pesto Presto sandwich and it was divine I also tried my familys strawberry fields salad and Arizona rolls They were all really good The vegetables were fresh and high quality and the price for the portion and quality was a good price
I was amazed that they had a couple of options for people on the raw foods diet The juices are different but surprisingly refreshing
This place is a great example that eating well and health can be tasty and satisfying"
5,Just perfect   For what it is  Down to the Edison light bulbs from rejuvanation
5,"Its a beautiful day  Clear sky and around 65 degrees in the late morning  What to do  My little guy had been riding his bike without training wheels  Woohoo  Is he ready to go on a dirt trail  Were gearing him up to go mountain biking up North  Hubby suggested Riparian Preserve  It was an excellent choice  

This is awesome  my little one exclaimed as he bounced up and down on the trail  Then hell just stop right in front of me without warning  Five year olds get distracted so easily  Is that a wasp  Look at that hover fly  What kind of ant is that  What kind of beetles live here  asks my little future entomologist   Well be taking some tours and classes the Riparian offers soon

My little one did bite the dust several times due to some excessively gravelly paths  He learned to either walk his bike over or slow down a bit  Such a sport  Lets come back here again  That was fun  It was fun for us too

Were so lucky we live not far from here  It is a very well maintained park  As it gets hotter we would walk and feed the ducks in the morning and spend the rest of the time in the Regional Library  I highly recommend you check this place out"
5,"The Thai menu is totally amazing  I had the Panang and the coconut curry was to die for  I have been mistakenly driving past this wonderful place for a year  Do yourself a favor try Na Rai you will be so pleased  you did 
They have a lunch menu as well"
1,I like others am at a loss as to why this place has such a good overall review tasteless and awful
5,"Tiffany  the chanel counter 
Tana in the lingerie department 

these are my goto girls for everything i bring all of my purchases to them bc they are THAT much better than everyone else except shoes because the shoe people know how to work that confusing back shoe room 

but everything else make up accessories clothesall to one of these girls i recommend you only work with them as well "
5,Yeah it was good My wife  I went with 2 other foodie couples who are good friends for our monthly side dish function  The food was all fantastic  All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis which they all said were very tasty as well but at 1216 per Im a little put off  Im more of a beer guy anyway so I had a couple of craftbrews that are not available everywhere and then settled on a Firestone DBA  a very very tasty beer  and had several of those  Great food great booze club music atmosphere is pretty cool Outdoor area is excellent Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said he in huge letters on the bottom of the door  Oh and then 6 or 7 strong beers into the evening I found that the mirror next to the only urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to  Why is that guy walking directly toward me  Oh its me  In the mirror Dumbass  So then after relieving myself in the actual urinal I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doenst exist and somebody else says yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too so I dont feel like such a dumbass anymore  Fun night
5,"I love this place I love that its togo only no 3 hour waits like Pizzaria Bianco and the mozzarella is mouth watering 
Please try the mozzarella tomato basil sandwich You wont regret it"

5,I love Dr Scott He is the funniest doctor Ive ever met and he makes me feel good too Dr Scott is always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you are provided the best service and treatment possible The massage therapists rock too I will be a lifelong patient of Integrated Chiropractic
5,Total wine totally takes a crap on Bev Mo This store has everything The employees are also very knowledgeable The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling I dont like change So we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of Malbec The Malbec tasted amazing I was so happy For those of you who dont know its not only wine You can find everything else Total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests Also dont forget to chill your bottles before you leave
5,Try the Moroccan Chicken on the low calorie menu  I was really surprised at how great it is
5,"Wow

Been there 2 times  I wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke and to my pleasant surprise  it wasnt  Im from NW Indiana originally  I know corn  Indiana sweet corn cannot be beat  well  until I had the corn from Americas Taco Shop  This corn has cotija cheese hot sauce mayo and I swear crack  There has to be crack in there I have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat  I need that corn its just so good  

I dont eat beef and thats the only meat they serve but that wont stop me  Their vampiros minus the carne asada bean and cheese burritos chips and salsa quesadilla are all awesome  They also have delicious horchata but that corn 

I know where Im going tonight"
5,"Expect no com TAMfoolery herethis joint is serious about their broken rice business 

Endless options of different broken rice aka com tam deliciousness  dishes which typically include shredded pork and whatever type of meat flavors your fancy all within your 610 wallet budget Service is prompt and efficient menu is ez to follow focus your energy on the broken rice dishes thats what theyre known for 

I highly recommend the shredded pork  pork chop  steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side The portion is HUGE and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate My personal favorite is the steamed egg theres just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice Go easy on the fish sauce ngoc mam they give you on the side try adding Sriracha to the sauce to add some spice in your life the dish is by far no means lacking in flavorsodium All at a pansy 599 I could really eat this all dayeveryday"

In Arizona there is almost nowhere decent to shop 
unless of course you loooooove Juicy Couture in the event of which you should probably not even bother reading this review because this kind of fashion forward clothing wont appeal to you 

Acne Jeans check
Endovenera check
Ksubi check 
Nike check 

Covet starts off with an excellent mens shoe section 
continues with an excellent mens clothing selection 
and finishes off with excellent womens wear 

It really is a shame if you havent been to Covet yet Do yourself a  serious favor and support a small business at the same time"
1,"Boy is the name a temptationSeriously   Ill try to be fair though but Im writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing So much so that Im buying a dining room table additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while Im in my hometown based on the strength of this experience Even in a good mood this place wouldnt be breaking a 25  Im not in a good mood  

Texas cheese fries Pretty tastelessmess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack  cheddar and bacon Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or thats not what I had Bacon  mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it Saving grace was only ordering 12 an order

Kids meal  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun No refill offered this time on drink no straw either   By far the most cynical  kids meal Ive met Sure make a profit but dont take the piss  Fresh carrots are not hard to do  with white film on them sorry youve just earned a  1 star Should have walked out didnt  

Entrees

Cajun steak  Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldnt find They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldnt find it Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side  rare on the other close though 

Sirloin steak Cooked as requested  a bit over seasoned 

Sides Twice baked potato  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you You want an idea of what its texture was  Twice chewed would be a better name Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful and chunky term

Fried onions   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came fromThe mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected They looked very consistent though  canned   Never mind they were edible 

Steak soupreally more a stewbut tasted pretty good  Overall service was okish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me   thats for this occasion only  past two times its been great fun for the kid

15 rounded to 1 for the carrots"
1,"When I was in highschool various clubs used to sell Karshs bagels around campus to raise money I would buy a bagel and cream cheese and hide it in my backpack to munch on during class Soooo good
 I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to pop in for a bagel and cream cheese 
The guy behind the counter was nice enough I told him my order which came to 295 or something just barely under 3  I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under 3 I apologized and said I didnt have any cash and offered to run the the ATM  The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  the owner manager on duty maybe if she would let me use my card She looked right at me all stinkeyed and said No and returned to what she was doing No apology no Im sorry but there is an ATM at so and so Very curt 
Thanks a lot personality plus I will not be returning and I hope you choke on a matzo ball 
Shame too I loved those bagels"
5,Love love love Service is always fabulous and every dish has been perfect The local cheese plate and AZ wine selections are amazing I think between the 5 of us we have had everything on the menu and it was all delicious This is my fave place in the country right now Cant wait to go back over the holidays
5,This place pushes out some delicious food Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any Ive had and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good youll want to order both for one sitting Unfortunately only outside seating but cool art work on the building to enjoy while eating and dont be discouraged by there greedy practice of charging for extra hot sauce But of all things to remember make sure you bring cash the place cant afford a card processing machine which is a good thing other wise Id be there too often and a fat face looks weird on me
1,First off the restaurant is dim and dark I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain The waiter there did not have a smile and didnt seem freindly it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at The service sucked ass I mean come on there was only two tables including mines and 394 of the time he didnt check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill like seriously Are you that lazy Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side Pho had a rancid smell Noodles in my sisters bun thit nuong were hard and watery seemed like they were super old Overall I wouldnt recommend to ANYBODY
5,My husband and I have been going here for a few years now It is one of our favorite places Really low key affordable amazing food Between the 2 of us our bill is never more than 10 and we are always stuffed I love how casual it is and the humus cannot be beat
5,"I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event  Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldnt wait to have dinner at the restaurant  

My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 12 off a bottle of wine day  I cant remember exactly which wine we ordered but it was a Shiraz and it was good  We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil  It was all so delicious  

I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni sausage and basil  Again it was very tasty  

 Everyone was very friendly and prompt  I will be back to Upper Crust"
5,Yes it is bad for you Yes it is delicious Great customer service Clean fast and predictable
5,I love pita Jungle Everytime I am in town I make it a point to get here The food is fresh and healthyish There ice tea comes in a variety of wonderful flavors and is so delicious I would recommend you eat here especially if you like yummy food with a medditeranean flare
5,I love the girls there I get my eyebrows done every two weeks and I get my nails done there as often as I can Recently I just did the gel nails just the gel polish not like the fake nail stuff and I LOVE it I cant tell you how happy I am that I did it I always just did my toes because Id always manage to goof up my fingernails in the first hour after I get them done but with gels you cant do that because after theyre put under the UV Light they dry immediately No goof ups Plus they dont chip The lady said theyd last around two weeks Im so happy with them Its been a week and they still look pretty good 
5,"An oasis of little kid fun in Phoenix we hadnt been in over a year and came for a birthday party  Theyre always running a deal so look for one before departing  One year we did an annual pass  It was a good deal  There are also lots of special events that include deals  One time we met spiderman

There are lots of rides mostly for shorter kids  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall  Theres a train carousel minicoaster tea cup ride an up and down parachute ride several rides that go in circles in different vehicles eg planes cars and helicopters and futuristic flying machines and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides but not others and it also depends on the age of the child  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel but kids dont notice and have loads of fun  The arcade is really rundown but the ATM is really nice  There isnt much shade so be prepared  All of the staff are really nice

There are usually a few game and art vendors about ball toss game sand art andor face painting  All are a big hit with the kids but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece  Everyone is a winner at ball toss by the way"
5,"Took us a while to find a good Greek restaurant We have been here many times and have yet to have a bad meal

Gyro combo this trip Meat was very flavorful and great texture Tzatziki sauce is one of the best Ive tasted"
5,"Sushi ken I love you so much I dont even know where to start Its about time I write a review This place in my opinion is the best quality for largest portion size in the valley
  Let me just say now that if are one those people  who A Like California rolls B like spicy whatever rolls C Want to go somewhere trendy and have sake bombers then this is NOT the place for you please just dont come and spare me your stupid review just go to Ra or Stingray or somewhere like that
My husband and I eat here a least every couple of weeks I feel like the staff is our family They are very nice and polite A lot of families here restaurant is decorated simply 
Nigeri and sashimi are very good UNI here is amazing Yellow tail belly is awesome also love the seaweed salad
From the regular menu I love the yellow tail Kama and the cold soba bowl
I also really like that they are open 7 days a week pretty late since most places in AZ close at like 9"
5,Best BBQ ever  Go here and thank me later
1,"We went to American Junkie after we found a 50 discount from httpwwwrestaurantcom They couldnt pay us to go back

If you like velvet ropes not being able to talk to the person next to you because the music is so loud and being around people who are really into themselves American Junkie is your spot"
5,"There are many places in the valley and its surrounding cities to eat Mexican food however there is one and only La Canasta

In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often For the money you get exactly what you pay for a decent meal and generous portions

The chips and salsa are everflowing and the salsa is some of the best Ive tasted

The wait staff are generally pleasant attentive and very accommodating Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriends favorite dish the number 5 lunch special

There are multiple locations in the valley but this one beats them all hands down"
5,"I do a lot of traveling and during a quick trip to Phoenix I was able to get two classes in at their studio It was very clean and the people were friendly I did think the studio was excessively hot my second class but everyone else seemed to be ok with it so perhaps it was just me 

I would defiantly return if I were in the area again"
5,"Evil Place

Thats right I walked in there and I couldnt believe it  The people were nice to me asking me if I needed help and by the end of the day i had a new kitten

All joking aisde I love this place  I know you can buy food and other things cheaper at grocery stores but I kinda like a specialty store like Petsmart  The staff is great and anything you need they are more than willing to help out

To this day I have purchased two cats here and both are still awesome and amazing  The last kitten my girlfriend actually picked up and when I went in there to pick up some food they remembered which kitten we got  Apparently she was among the favorites that was adopted  

You want good service and a great place for your pets Petsmart is the best"
5,I love guerreros  I worked in Mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time Im a huera but my Hispanic pals all rated this place authentic  Its a husband and wife team that runs it  The best thing are the beans  incidentally thats how I rate the authenticity of Mexican fare They are the kind of beans I ate in Nogales during college at a place I could only locate while intoxicated  Thinner lighter colored and delicious compared to any Ive EVER had this side of the border  I live in PV now super far  but after this I think Im gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to Mesa Yum
5,I love the Superstition Mountains It is the most convenient place to get away from it all The last time I was there I hiked Siphon Draw up to the Flat Iron There were a lot of people on the trail but I still felt like I was in the wilderness  Camping sites fill up fast here so I would recommend checking out the Canyon Lake area as it is close and a pretty drive
5,"I have never had BBQ in the South Texas or anywhere outside of California except Bobby Q but of all the places Ive tried Bobby Q is my current favorite BBQ place EVER  I found this place on Yelp and came here while on a trip to Arizona  The place was pretty crowded but we only  waited about 1520 minutes  We ordered babyback ribs St Louis ribs corn and maccheese  They also give you DELICIOUS AMAZING CORNBREAD

Everything was excellent  The St Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had  They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks  Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like  a bit more on the sweeter side less on the vinegary side  The babyback ribs were also tasty but not as flavorful and less meat of course than the St Louis ones  The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs

I dont know if I will ever be in Phoenix again but this place is a mustreturn if I ever am  Oh and at the end of the meal they gave us complimentary piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts  That doublewon me over  I want Bobby Q right now"
5,"I am sad that Luckys is so far from where we live  I worked near Luckys last year and just happened to walk in for lunch  My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home which was so good my husband proposed all over again

The employees were so friendly and explained that their pizza might take a little longer than normal but they want to make sure its right  I loved everything about my visit there and was able to stop in a couple more times throughout the year  Its about an hour drive from where I live but the more I think about it I think were going to have to go get some more Luckys pizza  Great neighborhood pizza place"
5,Rarely crowded 4 tables indoors many more outdoors Wifi is usually fast Only downside is that its next to a gas station so the visuals out the window arent exactly spectacular But if you care about that why are you in Scottsdale
5,"Attended the Pink charity event at the Shade bar  Great time and the scene was fantastic

Need to highlight the job that Jason and Halley do with VIP tables  Ive worked with both of them twice now and the experience is always top notch  Always ensure that the experience is better than expected"
5,"I cant add much to what has already been saidBUT Ill try haha

Um dont come here without a map or some sort of gps device NOTE some spots in the mountain do not get good reception so a map on your phone may not always fully come in It is VERY easy to get lost

There are many trails I look forward to getting to know them better So far all I have really done is Mormon Trail and the Hidden Valley LoopFat Mans pass is probably my most favorite spotOH AND there are some really cool rock formations on the way there including a natural tunnel look for the rock that looks like a big mushroom

This is a good area to do a hike in the darkbut dont do it until youve done the trail a couple times in daylight You can see what seems like the whole valley from up there If you do the night hike make sure the moon is fullyou can actually see pretty well with that and the city lights Plus its GORGEOUS if you did mormon trail at night you could start about an hour before sunset then head back as the sun goes down

Dont forget water it is a moderate level hikeand flashlights would be a good idea too just in case "
5,"When Hoa called and said we were having a reunion of former branch employees at a Chinese buffet I wasnt at all apprehensive My normal concerns with such eaterieswill the food be maintained at a proper foodsafe temperature is this seafood fresh how long has the sushi been sitting out will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupturedissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine She is of course born to Vietnam and world traveled 

Lets start with my happiest aspect about HKGB the sushi No its not the best sushi in the Valley but they make it fresh for you on site You can stand there and watch it being make grab a soup or something else to munch on or just sit at your table and chat awhile Afterwards you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet sweet and sour chicken fried rice crab legs 

Now lets review the notsoshiny aspect the price Yes it seems a little steep that we paid about 25 per person with tip and I made only two rounds but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there grazing catching up grazing passing Lisettes daughter around grazing and making plans to keep in touch its really not such an outrageous amount to pay 

If you find yourself in this part of town craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry give HKGB a shot"
5,LOVE Chino Bandido  The snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven  Well all of the food might actually be heaven but usually by the time I get to the snickerdoodle I could die happy on the spot
5,"I pride myself on being that girl that tries out every restaurant I come across Its practically a hobby for me For YEARS I kept saying I want to go to Cowboy Ciao but we never made it Then thankfully the hubs best friend had a big birthday dinner there so we just HAD to go Thank you hubs best friend

I have to say that the service was incredible and the menu was almost overwhelming There were SO many interesting choices but I had to stick to the tried and true chopped salad  everyone and their mother has told me about this salad and I wasnt about to miss out The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank 

The chopped salad has earned its reputation That thing is defreakinglicious The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well but I couldnt get over how great the salad was AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty Seriously can it get any better

For dessert we ordered the spumoni I have had better no offense but Im not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy 

Im very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back  SOON"
5,The facility is a bit dated but the service is great  Dr Rios is patient and thorough and his staff are friendly and efficient  Dr Rios gave me several different alternative contacts to try in order to make sure that I was getting the right fit for me  it made a big difference  Who knew that they make bifocal contacts now  Theyre great
5,"Went wed nite wife tells me best gnocchi since Europe were cooked perfectly  I had pollo erbe terrific

  wine tasting director very good with tasty selections Will be back OFTEN Highly recommend Rich D"
5,Our family have used this Discount Tire for 11 years now  Amazing service and warranty on tires  Thank you
5,I cant think of a better Thai rest In PHX Consistently good food and service  They have Thai staples like rice paper rolls Tom Ka Gai and Pad Thai as well as more creative items such as Crispy Mango Fish Average Thai food pricing free parking  There are a good number of tables so dont let a short line dissuade you  Like any rest scope your table before you sit to be sure it suits your mood  Boisterous din in the main room when busy
1,Avoid at all costs Awful service slow as hell only uses disposable plasticwareplates to add landfill insult to heinous food  Despite telling them we were in a rush to catch a plane and multiple reassurances that the food would arrive in plenty of time they lollygagged around and I ended up paying 30 to be seriously pissed off and hungry with no food   BLECH
5,"The new Harkins Cine Capri one of the first things to open in Tempe Marketplace boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks Moviegoers can order brownie bites mozzarella sticks and pizza

The theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy And the screen is huge This is my new favorite movie theatre"
5,"Postinos a spot for high rollin winos 

You woke up at noon and had breakfast during lunchtime so the next logical step is to have lunch food during dinner time with some wine This is where postinos comes in 

The menu is full of salads Paninis bruschetta and a few apps There is a large by the glass wine menu 814 and hipster cool ambiance 

Service here is great the patio is quite nice with heaters a fire place and even a few patio furniture loungers  Great for a date hanging with friends and conversation

We started with the Bella Postino 9 Crustini with a artichoke dip and a hummus The artichoke dip was great as any fat laden dip would be The humus was ok but I am a hummus  snob

For our main we had the Vegetarian Panini 975 It was good and moist with hummus roasted tomatoes olives and an artichoke spread the focaccia bread was well toasted from the Panini press

We also had the mediterranean  salad 875 which is a romaine salad with copious amounts of feta Pretty good as I do like cheese but maybe not as healthy as one would want from a salad

For desert we had a crem burle simple not to sweet and well executed a classic"
5,Soooo this location is even better than the one in Superstition Springs They also have a play place which is pretty cool I ordered the deluxe chicken and it was simply amazing Fantastic service as well I ordered and set my stuff down and within a couple minutes my food was brought out to me with a smile Very polite staff and delicious food what more could one ask for I totally wish ChickfilA would sell thier ChickfilA sauce by the bottle cuz its sooo good
5,"Just because i feel like doing something different P
im just going to paste some song lyrics that i feel sum up Pei Wei on McDowell

Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
I said the truth is here the truth is here

I want more
Give me more
We want more
God damn it Im back to demand we get more
We want more
I want more and more and more
I want more
We need more
I want more
God damn it Im back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more

Verse 1
I stand here naked as the day I was born
Face to the dawn and my faith in the song
Blood soaking the pages I painted em on
And none of yall will take my place when Im gone
Im the pure raw uncut who the fuck want what
Here to show you sucker ass mutts whats the fucks what
Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me
Its got to be allowed to breathe
Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee
I want more than what your offering me
Songs that make me feel like Im already free
Im a rebel in my own right
Yall dont want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me
When the game need it Im exactly what it need
Put the soul in the speech let it go let it be

Chorus x2
I want more
We need more
I want god damn it Im back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more

I said the truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is

Verse 2
Not nearly a single solitary soul
Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold
One day itll have to be pried from my cold dead hand
Until then the big man is gold
Got one lone reason to go on breathing
Climb into the zone of the evening keep reaching
Just to pull more out the core of the deamon
The people need to see them pure human being
Blood sweat love hate life death joy pain
Little child running wild striped to the raw veins
Rugged junkyard dog off the chain barefoot balls out marching in the rain
Sacred war dance suspended in the moment
We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it
Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve
Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe

Chorus x2

Verse 3
Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul
Not bought and sold not all controlled
Bring a little fire when the world get cold
Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold
People need more freedom
Children need to hear more truth when yall teach em
Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching
Got new seeds with true needs and whos leading
I truly believe every word Ive ever uttered on a drum break
Right or wrong life go on but it wasnt nothing fake
I demand you start listening to the crowd
If not  we gon burn this bitch to the ground

Chorus x2

I said the truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is


the atmosphere is pretty hot here tooexposed brick always makes me Yelp"
5,One of my favorite brunch spots  Not the cheapest but you come here to admire the Arcadia familiescouples coming into have brunch  There is sometimes a wait but it is worth it  I have a hard time deciding between the lunch salads and breakfast  I usually cave and get the french toast or ginormous belgian waffle  Parking is plentiful but it is on a weird corner in the strip mall if you are going look for cork and cleaver
5,"Seriously  I seldom give 5 stars but it deserves at least this much
If it wasnt for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene I would go everysingleday

Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix  My mouth is watering as Im thinking about the Hog Heaven special  In fact my puppies mouths are watering too  Decent prices giant selection  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate  
 
If you are a cracker family I suggest going super early like super early bird special early  like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early because after dusk the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud super dicey Mexican Dance Club and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club  
 
Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ"
5,I live in two cities in two different states and travel back and forth each month  I tend to use services where I find them and havent really found a  really great barbershop in the last three years  While I was in Anthem this week I decided to give Vs Barbershop at Happy Valley Road a try  I rarely use chains and prefer a more intimate and personal hair stylist but I was pleasantly surprised this time  I was able to make my appoinmtnt online and choose the services I wanted to have with the haircutvery efficient  I didnt know any of the barbers so I just let the shop software choose one  I was treated to a superb haircut a very satisfying shave and a facial mask and massage  My barber Manuel was precise experienced and he went about his business with style I cannot imagine how many hot towels he used but I would not want their laundry bill Finally Manuel washed my hair AFTER the cut which makes all the difference for the rest of the day The overall experience was excellent and I am sure to return the next time I am in town  Yes the package was pricey but the haircut was standard price for this type of service This is no Supercuts or Hair Salontrust me on that  If you are looking for that old style Barber experience with more than just a clipped head please give Vs a try  By the way it is just behind Paradise Bakery in The Shops at Norterra
5,Awesome place EXCELLENT foodappstry the bleu cheese figs Ask for Dizzy Dre hes AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you Very patient with women 
1,I got my nails done there last Thursday for the first and last time I would never ever go back there The man who did my nails burnt two of my fingers really bad The place was dirty and messy and talk about noisy he asked me to many personal questions To top it off he answered his cell phone and talked on it about 10mins all load and on speaker phone  So rude and bad customer service It might be a little cheaper there but as the saying goes u get what u pay for
5,Do not bother going anywhere else This is the place to go for laser No contracts easy to get appointments very reasonable The staff is fantastic every one of them I usually go to Kristen but all others are as equally friendly and competent Location is very convenient also I have looked and I have received many groupon and living social offers from other places but I never bothered This is the one
5,I realize LL is a chain but I love their food My favorites are the Loco Moco and the BBQ Chicken I also enjoy their haupiafilled donuts The family that runs this place is very friendly and do a great job in making sure you will enjoy your meal Go there
5,This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate I always order pho Tai and water But Ive had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent I love the broth Its true pho broth Its not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen I love this pho place   try the greatest pho in Arizona
5,"I have been visiting Mrs Whites going on 30 years but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation  I almost got cold feet

Good thing I didnt The food is as awesome as ever The service is much as it has always been Be forewarned trendy restaurant goers who glom onto TV reviews Mrs Whites is not trendy there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you The service is matter of fact no goofing around you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing  this is the way it has always been at Mrs Whites If you are looking for others to pamper you this is not the place for that Mrs Whites is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food If you want Scottsdale ambiance again this joint wont work for you

When you go be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit There are no corporate owned semitrailers that deliver two tons of food every other day This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes 

I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 1230 they would be out of half of everything on the menu which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then Mrs Whites was open Monday through Friday from 1100 till 300 but Id swear youd be lucky to get anything after 100  and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers Id just come back on another day 

To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations Funky little holeinthewall familyrun operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesnt always come wrapped in a sterile designer package then you might get along with Mrs Whites

I love this place and hope I always will"
1,"I am DONE with Classic Car Spa their subpar car washes and their shady business partnerships  

Whatever you do DO NOT get your windshield replaced by the Auto Glass Shop that Classic Car Spa allows on their premises I am holding Classic Car Spa accountable for placing their customers in such close proximity to criminals 

While these Auto Glass Shop men are friendly and seem helpful it is a scam They replaced my windshield and hey it cost me nothing bc my insurance covers it and put the glass in wrong THREE TIMES After one week and many HOURS on the phone with them and my insurance company they are still giving me the run around So although it was free I will now have to foot the bill for fixing their crappy craftsmanship 

After trying in vain to get my windshield fixed by the Auto Glass Shop I spoke with the manager of Classic Car Spa I dont think Ive ever met a manager with a more relaxed who cares attitude That place is a joke Except Im not laughing"
1,Dont waste your timeArrowhead mall on the other side of town is so much better
1,"I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cutoff corduroys and patterned leggings What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishap

I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter When I dug in for the first bite a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served because she was sure she got it right The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold So the counter chic simply turned to me and send well we dont have anymore of that one

Thanks I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche She did give me my money back but no one apologized or offered me any recompense Im over you being cooler than me but Im not over you having no soul"
5,Best happy hour on this side of town The bartenders are very friendly and service is always prompt Ive never had a bad drink or a bad meal here I only go in if Jennifer is working though The bar has plenty of TVs too
5,"I have been to Mabels a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place The food is awesome try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs and the drinks are strong The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale 

Last night I was wowed by Mabels We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE but generously offered to donate 20 of the bar tab to the cause The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life Thanks Mabels for being so cool youre a breath of fresh air"
5,Great place for Italian food Very family friendly Mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff Never had a bad meal My favorite is Sirloin Marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge Recommend to anyone who enjoys quality Italian for a good price
1,Hey Thai Elephant Stop sucking You used to be so good Why is my egg roll cold Why dont I get a fork with my food after asking Why wont you make me the Tiger on Fire for lunch when I got it last week for lunch AND its on the menu When did you decide to cut my curry portion in half almost When did your service start sucking Hey every person that decided that my two top was not important enough to attend Why did it take 10 minutes to order my drink and then an additional ten minutes to actually get my drink By the way Tiger beer is on your menu If you are not going to actually offer it then you need to take it off your menu I cant believe its come to this I used to love you You broke my heart for the last time
5,"I never write these things But I have to say that you will not be disappointed with Paletas Betty Especially with the weather right now it is a delicious and healthy treat made with seasonal ingredients I highly recommend the limón amarillo when in season Delicious frozen lemondadelemon drop on a stick tossed in a sugar rub It is for certain served in heaven That is all

PS check out the hours yo You know whats up"
5,"I almost wish I hadnt discovered this place because its so good Tons of flavors and every kind of topping you could want even cake frosting 
So much better than MoJo and to top it off the staff couldnt have been nicer"
5,"Gotta love Sweet Republic great philosophy and great icecream and sorbets Ive loved every single flavor Ive had there peanut butter brownie swirl mint chip salted butter caramel mayan chocolate and more Everything is made from all natural fresh ingredients virginia peanuts fresh mint leaves etc 

When I really want to splurge I make my own sundae you get to pick two flavors of icecream a sauce and a topping 

If you havent been to Sweet Republic go If youre far from Shea  101 find them at First Fridays downtown farmers markets and more"
1,I took my family here and this was a disappointin experience The service was snobby and rude  The waitress was condescending and the food was overprices I have not been to the other Tomasos but I will clearly discourage anyone from dining at the Chandler Tomasos The service is clearly substandard and snobby
1,False ads do not stay there Unless you dont mind a dirty smelly overrated hotel The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray The place is run down and poorly serviced The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of I stayed on the fifth floor cabana suites and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place The suites were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room The pool was NASTY see pictures I uploaded It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look it had an out of order sign placed at the entrance This place was embarrassing I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again
5,This was our first time at Texas BBQ House They gave us a sample and help us with our order The brisket was fantastic I got the moist and my wife got the lean We both enjoyed our choices immensely I will definitely go back I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didnt see it
5,"My husband and I have been here twice in the last week for dinnerit is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said around 20 for dinner entrees but for vegetarian and organic food what exactly do folks expect  You get what you pay for  We were happily surprised after reading the reviewsthe food was amazing the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times  and ps we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble despite the review about only paying cash

Our first visit we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish  For an appetizer we had the sabziwhich is a huge plate of green herbs homemade wheat nan feta cheese and walnuts  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was deliciousjust the smell of it was enough to get us drooling

For entrees we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something thats agreeing with me  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said we can make it however you wantevery dish is made when you order itwhat  the dishes are made to order  I havent heard that at a lot of restaurants  After about 20 minutes our stews arrivedsteaming hot and smelling delicious  They were HEAVENLY  So many flavors and so fresh

Our second time here we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear a spinach dipboth were okbut I like the Sabzi better  The entrees we had were amazingI had a special of the day pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu which was blissful to smell and eat and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix

Overall if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice organic foods dinner go here and check it out  Everything will be fresheverything will smell and taste deliciousand the restaurants atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed decadent evening"
1,"No I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile 
A coworker recommended this place to me Actually two coworkers did
However upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it I noticed that there was mold in it

Yes mold

Sorry Miracle Mile your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent I cant forgive mold in a pie I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can

Who knows if I will get my 295 for moldy pie back

ETA
MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 295 I was given the option of returning it but its over a 40 min drive"
5,"I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses It was packed on a Friday  we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful the bread used is similar to a pastry dough typebut not as sweet The pasty was so filling I could barely finish it

My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty  so we all split it as dessert and it was so good They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty Its definitely rich and gooey 

I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too Amazing place"
5,"This is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere Downtown Phoenix  My art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about Phoenix being chain hell and thanks to her and Yelp I dont believe that anymore  I think she chose wisely as I loved this little space  

It was a nice place to stop and check out and then of course we had lunch at the attached City Bakery  A perfect activity for a halfday of school  Hooray creativity and uniqueness"
1,"Food poisoning alert There is no doubt in my mind that this incident was caused by the order of potato skins I was served at this unfine dining establishment First off the cook looks like somebody off the street at least wear an apron buddy 
   Now we are watching the games there and its about 30 minutes after I eat 4 fairly large skins which I dipped in sour cream and the rumbling in the stomach started Five minutes later I was depositing those skins in their tiny toilet and trying to hold on while the games ended Lastly another stop was needed on way home to drop off some more skins This place is full of local drunks but a good watering hole yeah literally Go here to drink and stay away from all food Also it was 8 bucks for one order of skins Why do places charge the same price for apps as they do for sandwiches Its another sign of a clueless place with poor food and hygiene Bad choice"
5,"Very very nice family owned bookstore that allows you to trade in your books and buy other books for half price The owners have also recommended many booksauthors to my family over the years

I came in today still seeking a book that I have gone to numerous libraries looking for I found a copy on the shelf that was much bigger than an ordinary paperback I asked if they might have any additional copies The owner was so nice and went in the back room not once but twice to find me the book and its sequel I was so thrilled to have found the books

I believe that almost every year they have a book clearance where they sell off many books for only 1 I wont be in town for it but if anyone is I recommend checking it out"
5,OK so this is how much I love this product I first tasted Lees at a Yelp Elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again When I was invited to the next years Elite Pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth Is Lees gonna be there  Ok maybe the whole French restaurants Bone Marrow gravy came to mind too but I digress When I made it inside to Pleydate I literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner I am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now The funny thing about that is I am not even a big ice cream lover I will have to visit the shop soon
5,If you are a big tea drinker like myself then you must check this place out They offer a HUGE variety of loose teas from all around the world They have herbal rooibos green black and white teas The selection is phenomenal and there is some loose teas here for every type of tea drinker out there They also offer high quality tea accessories that are beautiful like the teapots and tea mugs which are very classy and not overly expensive Great place for those looking to pick up a unique gift for a tea lover or for the tea lovers like myself it is like stepping into tea HEAVEN The owner is also very nice and offers good advice if you are looking for a particular taste or type of tea since there are at least 5060 loose teas to choose from Hear my teapot whistlinggotta go
5,"I go to Regios a lot today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is  I have been going there for a couple years  have never been disappointed in anything Ive ordered  Their beans are delicious as is their menudo only on Saturday and Sunday unfortunately and eveything else tacos burritos enchiladas chile rellenos etc etc etc is great  It is so inexpensive its hard to believe  Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans between us and it was 10 HELLO We had the minitacos but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were
  Check it out next time youre in the mood for some awesome authentic Mexican food  You will be glad you did  Yummy"
5,Every time I head to ABC cake supply I see this wonderful store on the way I often say I need to stop there Today I did It is a wonderful ecclectic store filled with unique items From baby wedding kitchen and on I picked up some of their mini cupcake stands LOVE
1,Not worth the money Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid
5,"I love me some Dobson Ranch  As far as municipals in the Valley are concerned this is as good as it gets Aguila is a close second  No overbearing marshalls  Rates that top out at 28 in the winter  Above average range and practice area including two large putting greens  Cheap pitchers of beer  A longtime cart lady who will spray your face with water in the summer  

As far as the course itself this is not typical AZ golf  there are no cacti only treelined fairways and some water sprinkled throughout to pose as threats    But there are birdies to be had and lots of them 1 3 5 7 10 13 15 and 18 are the best chances in my experience I consider this my home course  The greens are usually pretty moderate speed to slow  this is grainy bermuda not some hybrid or bent grass so prepare to run the putts into the back of the hole  5 is my favorite hole a shortpar 5 that gives you the chance to hit over a tree left and drive the narrow fairway leaving you a long to midiron into an elevated green that slopes toward you  8 is a formidable challenge if you have the tendency to block or slice as may be the case the ball from timetotime as your ball will face a watery grave  16 is a tricky treelined hole with a tight driving area and doglegs right  And finally 18 a short par 5 that is easily reachable and where a par feels like a bogey  A scant 6600 yds from the blue tees but rarely plays its full length there are some low scores out there

A great course value practice area and recently renovated restaurant and bar  5 stars"
5,"Mouth watering Thats all I have to say

The food at this place is seriously amazing Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal The scallops were a highlight as was the potato pie dish thats not a very technical name for what it was but thats my best effort It was all very very good and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost We genuinely enjoyed our evening here and we will absolutely go back but it is pricey especially for the size of the dishes

The atmosphere and ambiance are so fun and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places weve been in Scottsdale I highly recommend this for a night out with friends or a cool date night It seemed as though reservations would be a good idea although we didnt have them and were okay it was busy though"
5,IKEA is so much fun Its a little bit of a walk up and down the store but with all the different items on display there is time to sit and relax on the chairs couches beds I love walking around the store looking a new ideas for my own home They have very good prices on all household items When shopping for accessories for the house I highly recommend going to IKEA because you are bound to find something Simple things such as Tupperware trash cans bathroom accessories can all be found at a really good price
5,"This review is for Gils catering  which is fantastic  

Our perfect event for a new product launch needed to be casual but tasty and high quality  Gils was all of these things  The food presentation is pretty without pretension  Everything was fantastic  Best of all Gil worked with us to plan an event within our budget  

Fare is traditional with a tasty twist  our group loved the chimis taquitos enchiladas and especially the chips  

We expected 2 servers and 4 showed up  including Gil  They over delivered in every sense"
5,Enjoyed the egg rolls  So glad that they were made out of fried rice paper because I have food allergies  The entree of BBQ beef with rice noodles was also very good  I will be going back this weekend with the hubby for sure  Very clean and nicely decorated restaurant  Very nice waitress The restaurant smelled really good too spices maybe  A bit warmer than I would like inside  Maybe they need to turn up the AC
5,My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time I have nothing but good things to say Food wait staff and overall experience were excellent This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper leather booths etc If you havent been I cant recommend it highly enough Give it a try and youll be glad you did
5,We came here the weekend of the Grand Opening I will say we were very impressed and  there was so much to choose from at this new and improved Pets Mart  There is a Hotel here for Cats and Dogs There is a Banner Pet hospital and there is a Grooming station as well as a Dog training store as well Talk about your one stop shopping I even got to hold a beautiful baby girl Pug just 6 weeks old She was absolutly adorable   We took a picture but have not figured out how to download it yet Nice and Clean all throughout the store  We purchased a few items and then we were on our way  Lots of Parking in the lot Plus nice clean human bathrooms
5,A great family owned restaurant Their lunch specials are very reasonable I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe  I would go so much more often
1,"Glad this place has new ownership I should probably remove the review below Its really harsh and doesnt apply to the NEW establishment  You have been warned  


Short Review

THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS

Long Review
We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night We were excited to be out on a datelike experience cuz its been a while We went to my inlaws for dinner and then headed to Draft I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall 

The music Good music probably the only good thing about this place  if youre a hiphop fan All hiphop all night 

The crowd Ghetto fab all the way Seems like everyone there is late 20s  early 30s and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd and none realize its not 1996 anymore Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms It was entertaining until it became annoying Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved  ugh

The atmosphere small crowded  Small dance floor  A couple pool tables but dont expect to get one Some TVs playing various sports which I guess qualifies this place as a sports cafe 

The service OMG we had one beer each and the line was retarded over 30 minutes to tab out No line in sight just people crowding together trying to get to the front of the line  Oh and LOL the bar tenders are total morons one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong  Weirdos

If any of this appeals to you this is your place 

BTW her friend didnt show and we ended up going to Skip n Jans to play some pool o  We had a great time there o"
5,"My work got some Christmas allowance and instead of doing a dinner we decided to get a really nice lunch for our branch We decided on Oreganos cause it was on the way 

I had the stuffed Italian sandwich and it blew my mind I couldnt believe how bug this sandwich was it provided me with two wonderful lunches 

It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldnt even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much 

After that experience I am going to make more of an effort to get to the restaurant instead of getting it to go"
1,"I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following

1I have only been to this place once
2I didnt get a chance to actually try the cuisine
3I am a sympathetic person to servers as I have been one

That being said I give this place one star for reasons of poor service

About six months ago at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon we decided to eat at this place The atmosphere was warm and cozy typical college bar with collegeaged waitresses

We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers The beers came the food never did and we watched other patrons come in eat and leave  All the while our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks we got them ourselves from the bar 

Since my bf and I both worked in food service we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is understaffed  But after an hour of waiting we finally crossed the room to speak with our server She said I cant imagine it will be much longer I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook

Where was the manager that day Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all

We left money on the table for our beers and walked out I guess there is a first time for everything"
5,"As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience  Some might call it a finedining experience but clearly this was something more  A tribute to opulence and Reganera excess Dominicks is your sevenfigure foodie fantasy come alive from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal  Its glittery bedazzled and oozing pretension  and I loved it

The Service
My visit to Dominicks was the night after its official opening  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and while not perfect the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable  Our server Drew let us know that the wait staff only had 2  3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles

The Food
We started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp  hardly conducive to sharing  so we ordered two And Jumbo they certainly were accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough  Ever the daredevil I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesnt like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner
For the main course we both had the 9oz filet lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus  My filet was a perfect rareplus with a dark pink center expertly seared and juicy
Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me  Im not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasnt particularly excited I should have been  The dough was light and fluffy the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt  texture
After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people  The tiramisu was spongy and light with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum  A nice finish to an excellent meal  

Atmosphere
We were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool  I bet they didnt make it through the weekend without someone making a splash"
5,"I Love this place I eat here either take in or take out at least 2 times a week

I also agree with some of the others I love the fact that I can try something new without committing I love the revolving sushi I also do not like that there are a lot of spicy selections Why not offer the spice on the side I would love some of the sushi but it has that spicy sauce on it

Some of the best to offer that some people might not know about

Haru sushi  Tuna stuffed with crab and topped with avocado
Hand rolls  YUM Some are only 250
Udon  Good

The staff is great The wait can be long on some days or eves

Love the baked scallops Great mussels too"
5,Very nice neighborhood spot  The mussels are great and both pork dishes we tried were outstanding  The BaconCheddar biscuits make the meal and Fig pecan pie is the perfect finish
5,"I had a tough time deciding between 4 and 5 stars  Wish there was 45 stars available for me to choose

Went here on a business trip with a coworker and tried it out I had at least one of the following
Sapporo  Can it ever be bad  It was served very cold  Thumbs up
Green Tea  Good  Good service on the refills also
Edamame  Good  Right amount of salt
Miso  Interesting wooden bowl and wooden spoon  It tasted good tho
Yellow Tail Salmon Tuna Albacore Uni FW Eel  Kampachi nigiri  Good stuff on all of those  They also have Yasu style nigiri for some types and they are good  It usually involves ponzu on top
Spicy Tuna and Softshell Crab roll  SSC was great

Service was pretty good and sushi was also good  The bar was full but I wish I could have eaten there  The sushi chefs were friendly and talkative to the people at the bar which is unusual at least compared to LA  The base quality of the fish outside of whatever ponzu soy wasabi and other ingredients were on it was pretty good but I wouldnt say 5 stars  Since I generally judge a place wholly on the food I give it 45  Failing that I rounded up"
5,I love this place  The first time I went I had my mom and my sister with me  We all got pedicures and by far the best foot massages Ive had at any of these nail places  The thing that really impresses me the most is that after only one visit the next time I came in they greeted me by my name How often does that happen  Hello customer service welcome back  Its husband and wife owned and operated and they are as nice as can be Love it here  Great atmosphere friendly good service affordable  You wont be disappointed
5,Midpriced dining with high end flavor I ordered the special Yelp menu Started off with mixed green salad with fig dressing Very good Moved on the the smart chicken Tender char grilled breast with corn risotto Yum  Topped it off with a perfect chocolate de creme Staff was friendly and very on top of things Great experience  Im definitely coming back give these guys some love
5,"Still loving Sunflower after a year and a half  I actually moved houses to be closer to this grocery store  The staff have never complained about going an extra mile the prices have stayed better than any store Ive been to lately and they have been having great beer specials

Special note  They have a large selection of homeopathic and environmentally sound products for your everyday corporal adjustments  Tons of specialty soaps herbal supplements and vitamins  Check for the solution here before going to chain pharmacies"
5,"Ace and fried mushrooms at Caseys My version of heaven 

The food is good and the beer is even better but what people really go for is the ambiance The most awesome potpourri of people Old young but always interesting

Say hi to Thomas the cat for me Hes chilling with the patrons when ever its not too crowded"
5,"Top notch cheesesteak One of the best in the valley This place has a large delivery area and is located right by campus The owners are really nice and friendly Im really glad something moved into this spot Its so convenient 

Their desserts are great as well I wish they had some chicken options but they are new and said they would be adding to the menu as time goes on My girlfriend said the turkey sandwich was fantastic They sometimes carry Tasty Kake so ask about that 

Ive had the authentic cheesesteaks from Philly and this tastes every bit as good if not better Its definitely in my top 5 local cheesesteaks

Edit Just ordered delivery  Lightning fast This place is incredibly legit I went with a cheesesteak with White American cheese instead of wiz this time  So incredibly good They tossed in a new dessert they didnt have last time which was awesome 

Their prices are really good and their food is so delicious Im a huge fan Im not kidding with this 5 star rating  I love this place Rave rave rave"
5,"The Westin Kierland is a beautiful resort located in PHOENIX not Scottsdale 

Some close friends of mine from Canada stayed in this PHOENIX resort for a few days so Ive hung out in its rooms and generally lounged about the property The rooms were impressive beautifully decorated and spacious We especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds where guests to our fine city of PHOENIX can roast marshmallows 

The Kierland has some tough competition considering that the city of PHOENIX has every one of the most famous resorts in the Valley from the Biltmore to the Phoenician to the Royal Palms It does pretty well in a tough lineup No offense to Scottsdale which also has some great resorts such as the Four Seasons Its just that the most famous ones are in PHOENIX

5,"Sprouts is my favorite market to shop at They are a great company who have a very friendly staff in their stores as well as their corporate office They are also very involved with the community and with local farmers and businesses

The prices for all the fresh and natural groceries they carry are the most reasonable out of all the grocery stores I have been too The Vitamin Department has everything you could ever look for to help your well being and they are always extravaganzas in the stores so you are always getting the most out of your money and in times like these I know people are very appreciative of that since groceries are becoming more and more expensive everyday or so it seems

I most definitely recommend anyone to shop at Sprouts"
1,"Went to Fatburger with our family tonight and will not return 

Average food The burgers were average The lettuce was wilted the tomato was green and nothing outstanding about the flavor Id say better options nearby are Joes farm grill Innout or Culvers 

Cleanliness was average The floor was a little sticky and the beverage area was kept very neat The kitchen appeared clean 

Service was below averagehorrible The cashier was very unpleasant We all ordered at the same time and the first half of the food came out about 15 minutes prior to the 2nd part It was pretty slow By the time we got the fries they were cold The staff literally acted like they were a bunch of highschoolers who were annoyed that there were any customers who interrupted their hangout 

I know this sounds harshit is My experience was absolutely horrible We will not be back and I dont recommend that you should either"
5,I love this place  Great food great service from some of the nicest staff and just a fun place to go  It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour  They have a wonderful selection of beers fantastic wines and I have never once had anything but great food while eating there
5,"I had the pleasure of living across the street from this treasure for about 6 years Im still lucky enough to work close by   Let me be clear I m reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for takeout or instore dining

This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita breadits also the ONLY place Ive found for whole wheat pita
There are several choices for Feta cheese Danish FrenchGreeksame with olivesthere are choices
I ALWAYS buy my tahini here All the prices are very inexpensive

Need spices  They have them all  At about 25 of the price you would pay anywhere else
The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store with REAL prices for REAL people  It is NOT a specialty store with trendy items and inflated prices  They sell food items that you will actually use  The bonus here  You wont find a 10 year old can or jar of something

On to the restaurant portion  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a takeout joint that happens to have places to sit and eat  They do have tables and they do perform table service its just got zero charm  You go for the food thats it

Okay food  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for  Let me repeat  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH  GET IT  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin tasty  Actually I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj
Im not crazy about their hummus maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb But its not bad
Gyros are good and not greasy Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine
Chicken shwarma  Yup thats good too
Im sure Ive had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in but I honestly cant remember what or when
"
1,"I was looking into gyms around the area Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy I asked about memberships and then he said Sorry we are sold out I stood there stunned Then he snickered Just kidding Trying to be a good sport I went with it 

Next came the young sales guy He was personable  at first anyways Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids Bad sign I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me I had interrupted their important conversation Then they were both saying Yeah like well um no I mean yes In other words no straight answers 

We sat at the sales guys desk and the wheeling and dealing began I felt like I was purchasing a new car If you choose option A you then can go to all the gyms If you choose option B then only here  The whole time I could see the childrens area and the kids were being completely ignored and we are talking very little children When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde routine Well you only have today to make a decision after that no price guarantee   From there he was down right rude

I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened Like Sarah G I felt horrible when I left this gym  It was an awful experience Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street They dont have the same amenities however it is locally owned and the people are very nice there"
5,"Great and has been for years  Lines out the doors at lunch but worth the wait  I recommend combo K

This place is the where you should take someone from out of town that wants the best mexican food"
5,"Another great Italian find

My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend  Wed never heard of it but were always up for trying something new especially with 50 towards our meal  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised

When you walk in the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant and there was a lively energy in the air  After browsing the menu I ordered one of the few Chefs Specials of the night  tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio and voila  a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time

We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty good portions as well  Although we were full we decided to order a dessert to share  the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo  yum  The perfect sweet ending to our meal  In addition we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks on the house

I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the womens restroom was clean spacious and had a fresh fragrance to it  I normally dont notice that but I was impressed by this

In speaking to the waiter and the owner we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but theyve been in business for over 15 years  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley well be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine Northern Italian Cuisine without a doubt  I suggest you go check it out also  bon appetito"
5,Love this placecant beat it for a healthy meal Tons of good options that are tasty without all the cheese
5,Agree with those who describe this place as enchanting  The rooms are extremely comfortable the grounds are picture perfect and the pools are very pretty  We had 8 people in our group ages 1564 and everyone found something they loved about this place
5,"I was sent to Amomi spa from my OBGYN for my  first pregnancy to get all of my ultrasounds  I felt very at ease the first time I walked in because of the very clean place and friendly staff Every ultrasound technician I have had has been really great and knowledgable  I really like that they have high tech equipment with big plasma tvs on the wall so I could see a bigclear picture of the baby Also the  large spacious rooms are really nice On a side note they have great products to buy in the lobby

Now pregnant with my 2nd baby my OB referred me to 2 different places this time for my ultrasounds Without hesitation I knew I wanted to go back to Amomi spa again to get all of my ultrasounds I have already been twice this time around and looking forward to going again in a few weeks"
5,We had a GREAT dinner there on Saturday  We were celebrating my aunts birthday and we ordered from the regular and special menus  I had a truly wonderful chicken Madiera my hubby had meat loaf which is always a tell for a good place my uncle had fried haddock which was crunchy and not at all greasy and my aunt also had the chicken Madiera which was forktender  We also had great service  attentive without being too much and we completely enjoyed our meal  We will definitely visit this location again
1,"Phoyuck this place 

I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house 

The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldnt eat it it was literally served on a plate of grease 

The bun was about the same It lacked flavor the rice noodles were slimy the spring roll was loaded with grease 

I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass

The service was horrible and I will not be back"
5,"we celebrated my birthday all weekend  we made the trek to bobby q on sunday I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and let me tell you about that mac  cheeseit was amazing Mr H went with the chicken and brisket and for his sides beans and potato salad  
The food is sinfully delicious I will NOT be coming here as often as I would like I found it too indulgent it is definitely a treat and worth trying I love those little donuts they give you at the end"
5,"Id been hearing about Defalcos for a while now My husband Jim W and my youngest Abby raved Best steak grinda since Baston they said So on an expedition to get more raw chocolate we went

The first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the racks of Italian foodstuffs I loved that The place screamed Boston from the moment we walked in the door When we ordered Jim found one of my favorite types of soda in the case Doc Browns diet black cherry I was in heaven

So we got our number and sat down While we were waiting  a short wait  I got a brilliant idea which solved a longvexing problem Guess it was the east coast vibe

The food came and I was in heaven We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side Lots of mushrooms and peppers It didnt look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat

Whats not to like at Defalcos The food is fabulous the prices are good the people are really nice and they have all kinds of imported goodies So I guess the only thing I didnt like about Defalcos was leaving"
5,Incredibly good calzones friendly service nice courtyard seating
5,Nicnacs galore
5,"After talking to a number of bartenders in the area  and doing some fairly extensive personal research  I feel pretty comfortable saying that if you want the best cocktails in the Phoenix area you should head to the Jade Bar at the Sanctuary Resort  

This is off the beaten path a bit and after a few miles down streets with no street lights it felt a bit like driving to a ski lodge up in the mountains  Its worth the drive though  I had two excellent cocktails The Last Word and a Pendemums Club and one enjoyable and informative conversation with Jillian the bartender  Wish I could have made some of their mixology classes"
1,omghands down the worst chinese food Ive ever had anywhere  Stopped by for lunch with my wife  I ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp  Barely edible  Makes Panda Express look like gourmet chinese food  Prior to Flos the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in Nebraskabut thats Nebraska  Im chinese and live in San Francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food
5,"What an amazing Mini Vacation  I went in August which was about 105 degrees but it was perfect  The pool was relaxing the water felt great and I enjoyed all three nights of my stay  We decided it was so great we never left the resort  

The Room was very clean and very comfortable  

Talavera had the most amazing Fish Entrees the seabase OMG I can still taste it the salmon was the best I have ever had and I dislike salmon completely  The service through out the restaurant and hotel was amazing  The special drinks they had were very tasty and made the 105 degrees weather manageable  

The brunch buffet and breakfast at Crescent Moon is excellent all three days so fresh the pomegranate fresh juice was amazing I had three  The food tasted like the items were freshly picked that morning  I literally gained 5 ILBs on this trip and it was worth all of it  

The Lounge had tasty small Tapas which I enjoyed while it drizzled that night the whole hotel has a great relaxing ambiance

The nights were amazing to walk around the hotel or sit around the pool with the night lights on and enjoy the peacefulness of the resort  I believe we saw bats flying around in the middle of the night which was very cool  

Worth every penny  Just watch out for Camera Speed Traps on the way there  Enjoy"
5,"Delicious barbecue we had 4 meats platter that we split with three people  The pulled chicken is amazing the brisket tender and juicy the ribs succulent and flavorful best barbecue around  The sides were delicious as well mac  cheese was great mashed potatoes did not disappoint ranch beans arent anything special but they tasted good  

Service was great waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order Atmosphere is good not too noisyquiet the lighting could be improved though a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating though the food wasnt there long enough to be seen

Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs chicken brisket etc"
5,Lovely outdoor seating area very dog friendly Dont sit in the back of the outdoor seating area because it smells like propane back there Had some coffee and just hung out for a couple of hours It was a pleasant experience Didnt order food this time but next time I will because every dish that came by looked magnificent All of the prices on the menu looked very reasonable for the portion
5,Excellent in every way  Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night  GREAT live music excellent wine selection   Keeping Fountain Hills young one weekend at a time
1,We checked out RnR on Sunday just a few days after opening In all fairness I have to agree with many of the other reviews Even though they are new these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items He was struggling to explain Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time Our water had just disappeared Then the food I ordered the grill cheese  a rare treat and when I order it I want it good It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread The cheese wasnt melted I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out Icky Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids It became comical after the third person came out My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and come back and try us again He made no effort to make things right either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables
5,"This place is such a delightful treat Not only is the Barrio Cafe in what some Phoenicians would called the actual barrio but its nondescript on the outside and purely magical within Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local 

You really cant go wrong with anything on their menu although their seafood offerings are my least favorites I am in love with their conchita pibil which is their slowroasted pork and they have the best madeatthetable guacamole in all of Phoenix Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel but save room for one of their delectable desserts Im a fan of their flan in particular 

Service is spot on and its usually pretty packed so come as early as you can or face a semilong wait at the bar Dont worry though theyve got great margaritas This is the place Tempes Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day But it probably wont"
5,Very Hip Hotel and Comfortable  Amazing location Great Staff all is good at the Valley HO 
5,"PCG is the restaurant by which I judge all others PCG is totally dependable always excellent Service is always good food excellent i have eaten here probably 20 times and have never had a bad meal 

Although the food is not challenging in that there are no weird flavors or textures if you want a great nouvelle American meal for a reasonable amount of money you need look no farther than here"
5,cant go wrong with a Double Double fries and a shake Always good Great service I got some cold fries once called the corporate office they sent out some gift cards for our meals then followed up with a thank you card as well Not to mention they sent a coupon in a Xmas card that year You
5,This place is very good  I have dined here for breakfast lunch and dinner but Sunday brunch takes the cake  Food is all extremely fresh and tasty  The best time to go is when this place gets cranking the style is smaller portions of the food that have to be replaced very often when busy allowing for extremely fresh food  Asian food is always good and the gentlemen behind the line can do custom stir fry for you  Italian station has fresh pizzas that once again are made fresh for you or order a custom calzone like I do  Mexican station always has the staples but recently had crab stuffed poblano rellenos    Bertos gelato with like 16 flavors is a great way to end your meal  If you like buffets do yourself a favor and make this your number 1
5,Pizza Venice has hands down the best pizza in the Valley In my mind theyve got the best bang for your buck with the XL threetopping pizza deal Get that with the garlic crust and youre buying pizza nirvana It doesnt hurt that the owners are incredibly friendly Why would I even consider ordering terrible chain pizza when I can get a great pizza for a great price from a locally owned business
1,"We decided to hit up the Wine Down Wednesday that was happenin at Tastings courtesy of KYOT  Heres what went wrong

The event is from 68 so we arrived just a few minutes 3 maybe after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin  We walked in and the hostess she looks like shes possibly the manager or owner asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held

We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already  Talk about early bird gets the worm  We had to wait for about 34 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby

20 minutes later the hostessownermanager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didnt even come over to our table  I know youre wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly I just wanted some good 2 wine

Its been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order  Um you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago

By now Im ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu  Not so much but whatever  I can deal with that  Then I see the drink section  The claim for the event was 2 glasses of wine  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap but again not so much  In reality it was 4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that werent really what I was looking for  By now the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans  We decided after 30 minutes since we arrived to go next door to Sprouts get some apps and have our own Wine Down Wednesday at home

I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good which I dont usually do after one instance  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food but the service was so poor and substandard that its not worth giving them my money  I understand if the food isnt good at a restaurant  some are just better or more talented than others  However any business can and should have good customer service  I think this is where the cliched line of if I could give them less than 1 star I would comes in

Oh yeah and I slapped down a Youve been Yelped card as I left

Take that Tastings"
1,Bad quality ingredients I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful hard I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up
5,My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno  I never had one with potatoes inside but oh my this was the best  My only recommendation would be to order it dry with the sauce on the side  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ  The new location is so much closer to us I plan on trying all of their menu butbut that chile relleno is callingme The tacos were very very good though
5,"Ive learned to expect very little from airport restaurants  Now Ive been ruined  I went to Blanco and my paltry expectations were blown out of the water Prompt and attentive service flavorful and delicious food and a delightful assortment of drink options  Ill have to connect through Phoenix for the rest of my life 

I had the grilled shrimp salad which was fresh flavorful and filling I also had the sangria which was pretty good My friends had tacos fish and carnitas they practically licked their plates clean  Try the rice  it is a rich and delectable treat 

An added bonus They were patient as we sat for three hours waiting for our connecting flight If I ever find myself in this airport again you can be sure Ill make my way here"
5,"What a wonderful restaurant I cant believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size No sauces no bread no fries The fish tacos were delicious succulent with just the right amount of spiciness The grilled boneless rainbow trout was fantastic The pane seared sushigrade Ahi Tuna salad was to die for And leave room for dessertyes dessert Only 250 but arrives in a shot glass size bowl just enough to stave off the sugar craving
The decor is elegant and sophisticated Great for an executive power lunch or a date to impress menu changes 4 times a year and features local fresh in season food Very inventive menu starting mainly around 9 flatbreads and sandwiches to 16 for lunch Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive
Great food great atmosphere great for your waist line But even if youre not a calorie counter this still ranks right up there for the food quality taste and presentation"
5,"Stopped in here for lunch today joined by Mike C  Robyn N  This was my third visit ever to a CB  the first time to this one  I went with a Reuben Sandwich Plate which included a cup of Cole Slaw  a cup of Beefy Cabbage Soup  The service was good at this location the atmosphere fun the food delicious  the prices reasonable  5 Stars     

Reuben Sandwich Plate 819"
5,I have not been bowling in 24 yearsso you can imagine i was worried But this place is clean and fresh On certain nightsMondayand a few others you pay a 500 cover chargethen everything is 100 Food drinks  games and most important bowling games The instructions were easy We got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball Lots to choose from Lots of fun   It was a 2000 night for 2 of us The workers are very helpful and Friendly Bathrooms were also clean I did not see them spray the shoes with Lysol so that was a little grossBut other than that it was a great time
5,Maybe it was the authentic Gospel music in the background but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred and until this morning unknown pairing of chicken and wafflesa combination rivaled by only bread and wine in its ability to induce a religious experience
5,If I were to ever get hooked on crack I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts They are delicious and addicting
5,Best donuts I have ever had
5,Considering my experience with a previous dentist I was hesitant to try a new one But my experience was absolutely the best  Foothills Smiles is the best dentist I have been to in the valley They are professional friendly and reassuring allowing their patients to feel comfortable during the visit  Most people dread going to the dentist but I feel motivated to continue going to my 6 month checkups
5,"Vitality Health and Fitness is a small gym that offers personal fitness group fitness and fitness classes The classes and the training programs are all varied challenging unique and fun The members are positive full of smiles and easygoing The gym is not intimidating at all the trainers are kind and build programs that suit your personal fitness levels and the cost is VERY reasonable  

My husband and I have been working out with Megan and shes a doll  We havent gone for very long so well keep you posted on the impending RESULTS

Vitality also offers nutrition and massage  which we both plan on checking out  The owner is delightful and easy to work with If you have any questions or concerns about your costs or the way you are being treated she works WITH you to ensure you are getting the level of service that you expect and that the clubprogram can provide The owner is honest and respectful fair and reasonable I think everyone should contact this club and see if it might work for them  you wont be disappointed"
5,"After 6 years of searching I have finally found Laura  My brows have never really been bad per se but not great eitherI have been searching for someone to show me the hidden potential of my natural arches and Laura did just that  After only two visits she has groomed my brows into perfect shape and balance Its funny how such a small change can make such a big difference 

I also enjoy the quiet and private suite with the pretty chandelier to look at during my appointmentsand she always has great music playing in the background too

Thanks Laura"
5,"Just the facts re full dinner experience

Ambiance Thinking about redecorating the house to look just like Trader Vics  unbelievable
Service perfectly charming informative and attentive
Drinks I dont drink so read every other review for a review of drinks
Appetizer Beef ChoCho  amazingly tender it melts in your mouth Great flavor
Dinner Trader Vics Calcutta Curries good  better when you mix in the variety of garnishes  fun to play around with the flavors
Dinner 2 Chinese BBQ Flat Iron Steak Amazing  Crispy onions mashed potatoes and tenderflavorful steak will make you close your eyes and wish it would never end
Dessert dont know the name vanilla icecream covered in coconut
 on a bed of chocolate sauce simple beautiful and tasty 

Overall experience the best darn dinner experience Ive ever had"
5,Great MomPop store Weve stopped by several times for some fresh produce and to get treats for the kids We usually sit outside on one of tha picnic tables to eat gelato while the kids love playingpetting all the animals Thanks
1,"There was hair in the food Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish

The whole experience was pretty bad There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case

Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive

Pani Puri was OK
Papdi Chaat  boring no flavor
Bhel Puri  boring and no flavor before we found the hairs

Not worth the trip"
5,I went for brow threading  Yelena was extremely gentle and took her time making sure they were perfect  I just found my new brow lady and shes just across the street from my office LOVE IT  Give her a try
1,"I had never been to Rainforest Cafe and Im glad that I got to try it because I love trying things at least once however this will also be my last time going there Well start from the beginning 

The atmosphere was nice for the jungle but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me I felt that I had to scream at her to talk Our waitress was nice but didnt check on us often We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough We got our drinks ten mins later and my iced tea was good but my wifes chocolate shake was gross Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and 12 Jeez so expensive for something so plain I got onion rings for an extra few dollars they were okay but worth the extra few  My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didnt give her more than ten I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced Not worth it at all The food was mediocre but left me sick that night 

Not as amazing as I thought it would be after seeing it many times in Vegas"
5,"This is my goto spot for manipedis and brow waxing They do a bangup job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 35 minutes to be assigned a nail tech 
They recently got new massage chairs that dont grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do Also this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here I dont know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do Oh and they are typically 5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures"
5,In Phoenix for a concert and felt like Thai Found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out based on the reviews and the fact that it was near the friend we were visiting at the time The restaurant is in a strip shopping center that we never would have noticed or found had we not been looking for it Oh but what a magical dining experience The cashew chicken was the best Id ever had and we eat Thai a LOT and the chicken satay was exceptional Loved the veggie Pad Thai and my husband got a vegetarian tofu curry dish he loved Wish this place wasnt 400 miles from my house Id be eating here every week
5,"No attitude efficient lines clean well stocked with flat rate boxes and other sundries Is this USPS or a dream 

Writing Yelp reviews for post offices seems like weird or something but it feels so right for this location"
1,I dont like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice  The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross  The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned also gross  The chicken wings were not that great either  The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TVs on the wall  I will not be going back to this place so hopefully they get better soon since Barros pizza is going in the area soon
5,"Satori to Kaigen Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening

1st review  Nervous and working on an empty stomach with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herbbutter I had consumed prior to dinner Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses held my breath and flicked a wrist  A 2 brought me to Las Thai Cuisine

Peeped the website and open til 930 score My eye spotted closing time was at 900 though  Arriving on the scene at 849 poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed  They werent I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa  I humbly asked for takeout my adventure begins with the opening door

Smells are incredible  Having thought they were closed I had forgotten what I was going to order I rifled through the menu feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching they werent but she instructed me to take my time So I ordered a soup a salad an entree a dessert and a side of brown rice They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat on each item I asked for not the hottest but close to the top

17  Mixed Vegetable Soup Stellar

Culinary Thought Clear piping spicy and vegetable packed 

Ninja Eating Plan Gently lay over white and brown rice alternately


 9   Papaya Salad SomTum Phenomenal

Culinary Thought I got shrimp on the side due to allergies  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening  They even fenced in the shrimp within a Masaiesqe cage of cabbage to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya sprout and carrot forest Spice and crunch with every munch Beautiful

Ninja Eating Plan Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date its that awesome Fortunately my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one too


 53 Peanut Curry Panang curry style comes with rice Umami

Culinary Thought I dont like coconut I do now The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry  Tofu was my protein option it was done perfectly  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo

Ninja Eating Plan Laid over rice alternately brown and white rice interrupted by the occasional gorgeous curryonly spoonful  


Coconut Ice Cream Yum

Culinary Thought I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience  As I stated earlier coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try so I did  Coconut ice cream is delicious Coconut pulp or meat I still have a texture issue with but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable

Ninja Eating Plan Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy Perfect coda for the culinary symphony

I will be back  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style  Familyrun places are truly number 1  

Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja PAVLOV

Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming"
5,"I went to the physical location the first time with my dog Foxy to scope out the place  The store inside is iitttyyy bitttyyy and not worth going to in all honesty but the staff that work there are REALLY friendly and helpful  Foxy eats Evangers which is really hard to find and the only place I knew of that carried it was 20min away from me 
     A month later I run out of dog foodso I call Goober after research I find they sell Evangers for the cheapest price and they delivered it right to me  I wasnt home so they left it on my front porch along with a pretty large amount of free dog treats for Foxy   They left their newsletter some reference cards and their product list which is HUUUUGGGEEE in a bag hanging from my door  The reference cards you give out will earn you discounts on your next purchase  Oh of course I forgot to mention the delivery was completely FREE of charge  Ill never get my dog food anywhere else"
5,So yummy My favorite Mexican place Love the chips salsa and bean dip The extra spicy green salsa is so good too We are regulars here
5,"I have been taking vehicles to this place for 15 years mostly for routine maintenance but occasionally for the other annoying things your car does to you We have never had any problems with their service or repairs and they have always been reasonably priced fair and honest with us

They also refill propane tanks

Note  this business has outlasted at least two gas suppliers Previous names include McClintock Unocal and McClintock 76 "
5,Thank you Sunflower for having a decent selection of tofu and fake meats so I dont have to drive 25 minutes to Whole Foods Also I would like to tell you that I really enjoy your produce prices and your friendly staff especially the cashiers they are always so pleasant and helpful While I am at it I should probably apologize for sampling lots of your candy from the bulk item bins those chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels are amazing I promise I always use the scoop And one more thing its really awesome that you carry beers brewed by Rinkukiu Alaus Darykla the Lobster Lover is DELICIOUS
5,"Private Karaoke at Geisha A Go Go is the coolest thing to hit Old Town in a while   My girlfriends and I went this weekend and it was incredible I have heard a lot about karaoke being the new trend but not until I actually experienced it for myself did I understand why until now We had a private room with a flat screen TV and drinks at the flip of a switch um can you say bachelorette party  It was so nice to have a night out without actually having to wait for drinks at a crowded bar or being able to hang out with your friends without random guys interrupting with a cheesy line to try to talk to you It was 75 for an hour in a private room with 10 of my best friends And by the time you split that between everyone it was well worth the extra expense 

Seriously once you try it you will be hooked too I cant wait to go back"
5,"Yes its on the Northwest side and its tucked into a nondescript strip mall better known for being the home of Padre Murphys Sports Bar but dont let appearances fool you this is a great gym The gym offers a large selection of cardio equipment weight machines free weights and group exercise classes It also has a pool hot tub sauna and steam room But will really makes this gym special is its kids care facility It has video games popashot and a giant climbing structure that my kids like so much they are begging to go to the gym and its a lot easier to get a workout done when the kids are excited about going

Definitely a great find and well worth the drive to the Northwest side"
5,What a brewpub should be  The beers are great The food the Slingers wow  the service is all top rate  Lisa the server was very helpfull I need say no more
1,eeew It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials then I should have read them on the board The food was downhill from there The entire place smelled like fried onions
5,Brookstone is the Sharper Images older and more laid back cousin  Yea its got a similar feeling but its more focused on keeping you relaxed and healthy than on funky electronic toys  The massaging chairs pads and other devices are enough motivation to stop in alone  And if youre with a partner whos less interested than shopping its a great place for them to just hang out too  Trust me  this works
5,There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list  Its not your average Mexican fast food  Its a little more pricey but well worth it  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good they say no lard and I dont know what else they use to make it good  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection  I stop by whenever I pass by this place
1,"Needs a new name  now  

The Pischkes of old had such a sad ending  I appreciated McGraths effort to keep Pischkes alive  But it is nothing nothing nothing like the Pischkes of old  Call it The Blue Ribbon Cafe  take out the PIschke name  I cant imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person  Pischkes Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was  

The current restaurant is not a laid back family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwichessaladsetc  the current decor is pretentious and the food matches that"
5,I have been to this place many times and the food and service is always great I am so excited to have found a place where I can get freshly made good food out here in Queen Creek My favorite is their home made mozzarella cheese Its great on anything I frequently order the tomato basil and Mozzarella pizza and I recently discovered their vegetarian plate which was delicious The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable Dont forget to save room for the amazing ice cream they have
5,"Stayed here for the RocknRoll marathon like 80 of the guests and absolutely enjoyed my stay

the hallways to the rooms were the only slightly blah decor all other things such as the bedrooms bathroom lobby restaurant and pools were great

Amenities included
1 pet fish that someone else fed
2 complimentary granola for the race day
3 smores for our firepit next to the pool
4 nice waitstaff that was pleasant and chatted us up
5 super fast towel replenishment service 4 girls use up a lot of towels
6 great cabanas we never had a problem snagging one or two of them
7 happy hour decent food delicious alcohol
8 cool lobby area with lots of places to looooounge at
9 dog friendly
10 heated pools

love it  I will stay here again for sure"
5,"This is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests  It never fails that we laugh so hard our sides hurt  Always fresh always funny  Great place for a date night or family night  Even my teenagers love it  I never have to worry about offending my guests because their content is family friendly  

To finish off the night head down the street to The Sugar Bowl for fresh ice cream"
5,I was very sad to see this restaurant go I wish Anthony the best and hope he opens up somewhere else
5,Excellent Soutwest breakfast bowl  Great service  Very convenient to downtown hotels
5,"I cant help but love this place Ive been going here since quite literally the day the opened I move further away and I keep coming back

The staff is friendly the food is delicious the beer selection constantly rotates to new and interesting beers and this is basically the defacto hangout for climbers and cyclists Really cant go wrong with this place"
5,I went to Peter Piper Pizza tonight to celebrate my daughters 5th birthday It is a great place for kids to have fun Being a former employee of PPP I know that we could have had reservations for her birthday and had a party representative help with everything Unfortunately this was just a small family celebration So I ordered the big family meal deal which consisted of two large pizzas and an order of wings The pizza is always delicious to me it is not greasy like some of the pizza places out there We forgot to bring a lighter for the birthday candle so they had one on hand for us to borrow Needless to say this is a place that the kids love They can eat great pizza  play which is all kids worry about
1,"OK So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines  Boy they are pretty sad  I usually dont like to be too harsh on anyone but this airlines deserves it  

Please dont think of this review as complaining but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways Nobody likes a complainer right Haha  Well not never but if you have no other choice  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines Nippon airlines shoot you can even throw Delta in there  The flight attendants are rude This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own  

You know what I could go on and on but I really dont like to cry about stuff  Would I fly US Airways again No way  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth  Maybe  I just hope that their service of customers get better

  Then again maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadnt shaved and looked Talibanish  Oops"
5,"I would not survive without Channel 8 i really dont watch much TV but when I do I want it to count

5,I had the Crispy Steelhead and it was delicious The sweet pea risotto and roasted tomatochanterelle ragout were a great addition If youre looking for a great restaurant with an original menu this is the place to go Friendly staff and they were quick to seat us
1,Called last night  430 and tried to do call ahead seating for 630 for a party of 9 We are in town and are here to see some friends Explained to hostess that some in the group are seniors so would need to have assurance on reservation I was told to call back in an hour the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they werent that busy yet So I did as told and called back and after about 10 minutes of confusion and other waiting I was told we couldnt be seated until 730 or we could have seperate booths I explained that we needed to sit together and 2 hours was the best she could do I was so frustrated I told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements She said ok and that was it Nice job Texas Roadhouse NOT There is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place like Open Table One day there will be no customers to disappoint then maybe you will get it
5,Fantastic donuts Great selection Coffee was definitely above average
1,"Just had Daphnes for the last time In the 3 times that we have ordered from them they cannot seem to get a simple order right One Kids Burger with Apple Slices Nope one side of hummusNope But they are quick to charge you for the order Then you call and talk to a girl name Liz and she begins to tell you that they are correct and you the customer are wrong Even though I have all the food sitting in front of me nope still no kids burger or side of hummus HMMMMM keep letting her answer the phone and you will see your to go customer base decline We are an office in Scottsdale that everyday is ordering lunch for the office Daphnes has officially been removed from the menu book

Nice customer service"
5,"I have been here a few times but have to remember to come here more often 

I LOVE it 

Ive never made it past the refrigerated and prepared foods section but who needs to You can find everything you need right there 

The meat section is beautiful to look at they have a whole section of prepared heat and eat dinners side soups sauces etc grab a premade one or grab a few ingredients and make your own 

My favorite so far would be the Tub of Alfredo sauce package of fresh pasta and package of chicken breast strips YUM 
Dinner in 20 anyone 

Their Tomato basil soup is Amazing too 

I scored dinner for 3 last night for 7 
2 packages of their heat and eat mac and cheese and 2 packages of Tilapia all ready and in about 10 minutes 

Seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good fresh and easy food then this your place"
5,So I now frequent The Vig  If you go talk to Jason the bartender  Hes quick with the beverages and funny  Enjoy yourself  You deserve it  This place can get packed during dinner hour though
5,Honestly this is the best pizza that Ive had in Arizona  Im a sucker for woodfired goodness and fresh mozzarellaCibo does both to perfection  Additionally Ive come to appreciate the character and charm possessed by this little gem in a sea of chains and strip malls    The wine list is not overly extensive just efficient and thorough like it should be  The salad selection is full of variety and offers a bright way to begin their dining experience  Be warned  Cibo is pretty tiny causing a wait on weekends
5,I love the Madagascar coconut white tea The prices and very reasonable only downfall for me is they dont list the caffeine content
5,"WOW  I am very sorry that it took me so long to convince Bri D to go here  We went for brunch and it was amazing  Absolutely one of the best breakfasts I have ever had  The johnny cakes were out of this world  They have a granolay taste to them are filled with blueberries and topped with yogurt and real maple syrup  It is this awesome combo of sweet and tart that is great  Despite being three pancakes they werent heavy and dense like normal ones  They made me feel satisfied but not stuffed and gave me lots of energy throughout the day  Thats exactly what the awesome waitress said they would do

I love this place  It is beautiful inside I love their theme I love their concept and I love the food  Cant wait to try more"
1,"Considering what is considered the norm for workout facilities this place is WAY behind the times

This place would be amazing for 1952 it would then be considered clean tidy and cutting edge There are some actual perks about this place they do have daycare and plenty of mirrors for me to watch my fat jiggle while I run on the treadmill 

Its just an utter disaster When the BF and I originally signed up we got a couples membership at a newly redone Glendale location and it was worth the monthly membership fee

This place does not need a facelift It needs to be gutted and TOTALLY renovated You just feel a nasty moistness when you walk in the door which just gets worse the longer youre there and is even MORE WORSE during the summer Guys always have the weight benches dominated Theres never any availability for machines any kind from 4730pm then it starts to thin out Blah bla bla blah bla

Considering this is the Biltmore location huge disappointment Fact"
1,This place was messy and loud  The food really wasnt great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me
5,great food love the pad thaiawesome atmosphere
5,This store used to be closer to 19th Ave  Bell they have since moved and expanded a ton over the last few years Everything is made fresh daily ceviche guacamole salsas they have pan dulce delivered every morning yummm You can pick up the old school sodas here and good Mexican Favs like Pinguinos Gansitos Duvalin Pelon Pelo Rico De Las Rosa and even Bimbo bread just to name a few things they carry here They have natural all organic small game hens that can be stuffed or bbqd you can ask for their rub they have all kinds of meat most get the Ranchera here for some carne asada you just need to be able to say how many Libras Pounds and you want them to make it Preparada they will put in their special marinade w oranges onions and spices in the bag If your a meat eater you cant go wrong here I cant get enough of this place
5,"Love  It  Awesome pulled pork brisket turkey  The sides are really good too  I feel like its somewhat expensive but its worth every bite but then again thats BBQ  If its dirt cheap that means its not quality meat

Anyway the 2pound potato is great too  chives sour cream butter"
1,Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best and their schmears appear to be highly processed  Ive generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive as has the service  I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry and wanted a bagel theyre supposed be a bagel store after all  First no salt bagels  Arent salt bagels one of the standards  Second I ordered my bagel with cream cheese cream cheese being a 150 option to go and that was my real mistake  Whoever made the bagel didnt even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on onehalf of the bagel  The other half was basically dry  Unbelievable  Needless to say I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel  Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans  they have much better bagels and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you

Why do I always forget this place
When deciding on where to eat lunch
Here I could really stuff my face
It doesnt matter if its dinner or brunch

My wonderful tasty Honey Do
Alfalfa sprouts turkey on whole wheat
Add a slice of cheddar for you
This sandwhich cannot be beat 

Located not to far from the hospital 
So you get a great crowd of nurses
The hotties who come here are pivotal
Ill stay until the crowd disperses 

Get the soup in a bread bowl
Or a bag of chips if you please
Add a cookie for your hole
Ill say bless you after you sneeze 

Bottom line is you cannot go wrong
Youll love whatever you order
Go home and hit the bong

5,"Anything I write will not do justice to this awesome awesome hotel Ive stayed here a good dozen or so times over the past three years and its always fantastic I love all the rooms If you can get a suite youre an extra lucky duck but even the basic rooms are adorable with phenomenal bathrooms

The bar and restaurant is also great with fantastic appetizers wonderful specialty cocktails and fun rat pack music Breakfast is better than most restaurants forget about comparing it to standard hotel fare

The location is also good with plenty of shopping restaurants and bars within easy walking distance

This place is not within my normal price range at all but it is worth every penny and I would never stay anywhere else in the Phoenix area"
1,"Man oh man I cant decide whether I want to review this place or not under the auspices of if you dont have anything nice to say

All I have to say is this 

We ordered food It came totally wrong I asked for a vegan salad not specifically but thats how I ordered it and it came with chicken and cheese This just shows a complete inability to read the order People make adjustments all the time I have worked at a restaurant I have fucked up I should have been lashed 40 times Read what people order 

So when I got the wrong salad and saw what an unbelievable disappointment it was going to be I ordered a veggie sandwich instead which to their credit they delivered and took off the bill 

The best customer service in the world could not overcome this sandwich It was a monumental fucking embarrassment I cannot believe they let that thing out the door I ate it because I was starving but I would have liked to have driven it back there and go through it ingredient by ingredient with the preparer Explain to me how this is appealing to the eyes mouth stomach etc

I just hated it A lot 

Sorry Im sure youre nice people with good intentions"
5,"I brought in six pairs of shoes to Ariel to see if he could put new heels on them I wear the spikyheeled high heels  For 12 not only did Ariel put new heels that perfectly matched each color size and type of heel and even filed them just a hair so that they would wear smoothly but he also put a lot of work into fixing the front of them  Many of my shoes had toes that were worn shredded or faded Ariel made them like absolutely new  Amazing

My shoes are not Prada or Gucci  They are mostly Nine West with leather uppers and manmade everything else    However Ariel took amazing care of them as if they were the kings shoes  It is so great to have my favorite pairs of shoes back  I will return  Thank you Ariel"
5,"Best nights to go to Postinos are Mondays and Tuesdays  They offer 20 deals where you get 4 slices of bruschetta out of the 12 that they offer and one whole bottle of the house wine  Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched  if youre a petite girl     They then cut each slice into 4s  Perfect for sharing

We went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered 2 bottles of wine the 2 orders of the bruschetta which were 8 slices for those that cant count and a bowl of olives  The total came out to about 50thats a little over 13person wo tip  AWESOME    PLUS they have complementary valet parking 

Everything was just fantastic Ive never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable  I definitely recommend you come in regardless if its for their 20 deals on MonTues or not  Theyve got GREAT food and I WILL be back"
5,I agree with Tracy my wife and I are big fans of Fiorellas Definitely a treasure for the northwest valley The service is great and the food is delicious Prices are a bit higher than other dining options in the area but the friendly people and yummy food are worth it
5,"Best UNIQUE breakfast  brunch  lunch spot  This tiny place may look like a boring little bakery but think again  
SIt outside on the small patio area ck out the GR8 crepes savory breakfasty sweet  u pick or choose 
Hubby luvs lox  cream cheese  capers  
I luv the chicken aspargus basil feta   
Mmmmmmmm"
5,"Places like Made make me realize that there is hope for my life in Phoenix  It is a cute converted house shop that carries a wide array of stuff that you wont find easily elsewhere  

There is lots of cute baby stuff that I would laugh at if I ever saw a baby wearing  The jewelery is unique and cool it made me feel like I had etsy right in front of me live  They have some good books around and some key David and Goliath pieces  

I heart places like Made so therefore I heart Made"
5,Lately I have been addicted to a good Caprese style sandwich and Pane Biancos is AWESOME  I read the previous reviews so I went there expecting a crowd and nowhere to sit  This did not detract from the experience for me because the quality and freshness of the food was more than enough to get and keep my attention  The staff were very friendly and helpful being from the Atlantic Northeast I have high expectations when it comes to Italian done well with personality to boot I did not want to wait till I got home to eat my so good smelling prize so I went outside to find picnic style tables and benches  It was way to hot to sit outside and I was craving iced coffee so I went next door to Lux and was both surprised and relieved to find many of their patrons with Pane Bianco bags openly eating their lunches with drinks from Lux to claim patronage  Cant wait for a hopefully airconditioned expansion
5,A great place for midday healthy food thin crust good pizza  try wild mushroom  arugula salads are great too  the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines It is not an average American food eatery it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch
5,The food reminded me of my moms home cooked meals The beef with red salsa was super goodand not to mention the warm handmade tortillas The prices were decent the service was excellent and the food was great 
5,"Ive never been to this location before My husband had taken his car here previously and asked me to take it in today there was a nail a front tire The second I stepped through the doorway I was greeted even though all agents were busy helping other customers  excellent customer service to acknowledge Im there 

Less than a minute later I had a gentleman walk me out to the car and look at it He tested to see how far in the nail was and realized it didnt puncture so he took it out and said the tire was fine 

I went there knowing my husband is WAY overdue for new tires so asked for a quote He gave me a few options and told me what driving habits theyd be best for He also gave me the warranty information without me asking for it and included it in the price instead of shockingly adding it in when I would pay like most places would I never thought for a second that I was being oversold It was amazing because I despise going anywhere having to do with fixing my car 

Quick Clean Friendly Intelligent Honest That about sums up this place Id recommend it to ANYONE and tell you to go out of your way to visit this location"
5,"Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call The Slope Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly 40 years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time 

The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes new and used No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hardtofind parts good service and free air that makes this place"
1,Maybe I should have had a hot dog but I crave Chicagos Italian beef  I didnt get it here just some greasy old beef of some kind  use beef broth if the meat gets dry not a whole can of olive oil  YUK  It didnt have that good Italian beef flavor so I asked for giardinara to add some flavor  it was very oily too and I had to pay extra for any peppers either hot or mild No stars for that beef  the only saving grace was it didnt make me too sick  I expected to be sick for days not just one day
5,Ok so iv been a Starbucks junkie for yearsuntil i discovered dutch bros This location is my favorite although they are all good My favorite thing about dutch is you can order ANY blended drink sugar AND fat free You cant do that with any frappes at starbucks You cant beat their customer service either all the employees and incredibly nice and upbeat always greeted with a smile I once ordered a blended double coc coffee and it was too frothy for my liking so i stopped at the location in tempe since i was going that way to order a new onethey exchanged my drink apologized and sent me off with a new drink at no charge added bonus is the stamp cards so if your an avid coffee drinker like me youll be saving some money to Quick drivethrough for on the go
5,This place always pleases Their sandwiches are always great bread is great pizza is AWESOME and their short ribs are great The food is SO fresh The waiters are kind and friendly When we asked if they had some of their awesome ice cream she kindly told us the freezer broke I heart the deli
5,"Love Love Love 
All you need to do is order dessert here It comes in small shot glasses  the flavors explode in your mouth"
5,Loved my haircut Walked in and waited for just a minute The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip
5,Great for young kids tons to do and see
5,Obsessed Like IvegottheTwangyTartwithdrawalshakes level of addiction to this place Please make one in Arcadia Pleeeaaassse
5,Loved the winkie  Eat your vegan meal next door at Green and stroll over to Nami for dessert
5,I have been patronizing Casey Moores for 10 years and have never had a bad night  Great for people watching and the service is always great  Get there early or it will be standing room only
1,Every time I come here the staff is so rude Its the closest bar to my gate so Im kinda stuck Hey staff can you please pretend to like people
5,"I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time 

We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers going at least once a week and sometimes more than that since last July Everyone who works here is super friendly and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart We just walk in now and they see us and say Spicy noodle tofu hot right Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order I have tried most of the menu items The garlic eggplant is also pretty great The thai basil is also amazing I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry I never have had a good curry experience Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it which they quickly replaced with a new order but I just wasnt a fan Maybe its because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet 

The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere 

Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often That is pretty amazing If you eat dairy you have to try it at least once 

Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come I dont know what I would do without my spicy noodles"
1,"I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest  I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing   I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree

When my salmon dish came out I said to my self WHAT in the hell Two extremely thin slices of salmon little salad and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side  Salmons cheap and they charged me 15 for this crap  I work in the food industry and the food was crap

Next the entree  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth  Explaining to me how delicious this special was  So I took his advice and ordered  When the dish came out I said to my self again What in the HELL  Four small scallops 2 baby carrots broccoli rabe and cilantro sauce  The scallops werent seared enough the broccoli rabe was brown and mush and the baby carrots were still raw  The funny thing was  The sauce didnt even resemble any cilantro flavor at all  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet 32 for crap

The meal came out to roughly 60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again  I could of gotten some pho for 8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasnt even mediocre"
1,Cool place but dont try to arrange a special event The proprietor was arragont unflexible and unethical when I held my friends bachelorette party at The Duce Be warned
5,"I am in love with the cinema suite Being able to stretch out your legs on the LazyBoy recliner is the way to enjoy the movie The chair is spacious and the room is not crowded with viewers  The foods are at a reasonable price and the server is nice
For movie that are 2 hours long watching movie on the recliner is the best experience Also great place to go on a date "
5,Marcellinos was an amazing romantic dinner experience  I had their fresh pasta wmushroom truffles and lobster  The combination was amazing  I also had the white wine thats made by a friend in Italy  It was tantalizing and really lingered on my pallet  The homemade tiramisu was a blissful ending to dinner  The staff is attentive and very helpful
5,"Restaurant 28 is a solid holeinthewall thats pretty easy to miss but its definitely worth a stop  On my visits Ive gotten brisket and other barbecue and my friends swear by the chicken and say its some of their favorite chicken in the Valley  The hush puppies are great the greens are good too

Another review said it well when they said this place doesnt underseason food  Every time Ive gone it hasnt been bland its got some great flavor and its tasty stuff

Its in a pretty dull area where there isnt much else to do or Id be out there more often  Its a tiny place too but Ive never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy

Definitely recommended and I hope theyre able to grow and thrive"
5,"The Renaissance Festival is a place where everyone and anyone can venture to in order to awaken their medieval passions and expose a side of them no other place can reveal  Here people can be themselves without fear of being judged  They can dress in clothing appropriate to the era eat as citizens of the renaissance age would eat and live a day in the shoes of people whose lifestyle consisted of these aspects every day of their lives all while having a merry time

Whats fascinating about the Renaissance Festival is it is an escape from the everyday bustling industrial environment known to people of the 21st century  Once you pass through the gates you are immersed in a culture rarely seen these days  Men women and children of all ages absorb the spirit of the festival and change into someone only such a place can expose  Immediately you are compelled to have high spirits as people dancing shopping and just continuously enjoying themselves welcome you to the festival  From there the opportunities are limitless for there are twelve stages of continuous live entertainment jousting tournaments over 200 artisans displaying a variety of unique wares and displays of ancient skills like glassblowing leatherworking weaving woodcarving blacksmithing candlemaking and pottery

One specific entity of the Renaissance Festival that stands out in my mind is the old coin striking mill tucked away and blended into in the strips of stores surrounding it  Here a family of three father mother and daughter work to produce unique coins crafted into necklaces by means of a punch press  

The store offers some 100 different punch dyes each a symbol possessing its own special meaning  The categories range from mythological symbols to astrological to even ancient Egyptian  Once their customer has chosen two of their own special symbols they want imprinted on a coin they place a blank either bronze or silver between each dye and clamp it to a press  Then a heavy weight is hoisted a few feet above the dyes and then suddenly dropped onto the head of one dye eternally imprinting the symbols on the coin  

Whats distinctive about this certain store is they can fulfill the needs of any customer that they are presented with by owning such a broad spectrum of dyes applicable to anyone due to the meaningful descriptions given to each symbol  Additionally what captivates people is the fact that the coin is formed before your very eyes three feet away making the production a very personal thing for the consumer  

If you and your family are venturing to the Renaissance Festival in Arizona anytime soon which I would undoubtedly recommend be sure to stop in on this special experience not attained anywhere else close by"
5,In one wordexcellent  My fiancee and I had an amazing time here last summer when we were upgraded to a Spa Casita Suite because the hotel had found out about our engagement which happened right before we left for our trip  The room was huge the grounds were beautiful the pool was awesome and everything there was so peaceful  The concierge helped us with directions to anywhere we wanted to go and the location was great as wellnot far from the main drag but somewhat hidden from the outside world  We are hoping to return soon
5,"Holy AMAZING  I went here this past Saturday for a baby shower in one of the private dining rooms and was absolutely blown away by the food  We had a spread which included Mac  Cheese Sliders Chopped Salad some bread and french fries  Im still thinking about those sliders and the french fries  I cant WAIT to go back and order from the full menu 

As is par for the Sam Fox course the decor is over the top  I need to find out who designs these places and have them make over my house"
5,"Great experience at the Phoenician specifically Il Terrazzo We normally buy many loaves of bread from them at OTFM Old Town Farmers Market They were absent yesterday so we called in an order  went directly there to pick it up

Was gorgeous of course  they were as nice as pie

And the important part is that the bread was fabulous as always olive walnut chocolate cherry sourdough farmers rye wheat sourdough rosemary sourdough baguette"
5,Great Frozen Yogurt Helpful staff clean enviroment
1,YikesI wont be going back  The ordering system is confusing The staff also seemed confused The food was very bland and pretty tasteless  THIS PLACE IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS HONEY BEARS NEAR THE AIRPORT Skip this bland chain and go to Honey Bears
5,Excellent burgers and sweet potato fries
5,Fabulous service tonight and it was crowded
5,"I love Scottsdale Child Care  Learning Centers My daughter started going there when she was 10 months old The teachers are wonderful Not only are they nurturing and kind they are also very interested in each child 

My Daughter  has been attending for 6 months now and has graduated to room 2 for toddlers She knows over 30 words and I attribute much of that to Scottsdale Child Care She has loved all her teachers and welcomes with open arms each morning when I drop her off 
I would recommend this center to any parent especially if you are nervous about leaving your loved one for the first time"
5,"This place was a huge surprise and a huge relief

Being a foodie and quite the fan of healthy food this place definitely lives up to those expectations  If youve ever been to San Francisco then youll definitely get that feel when you enter the cafe

Its got a great atmosphere and the menu is by far the best when it comes to serving healthy organic foods  I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food but serving allnatural and locally farmed foods doesnt necessarily mean its healthy  People that are true foodies know exactly what I mean

I ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious  Im excited to try this place again"
5,"Based on Yelp reviews I went to check this place out while Im working on assignment in Phoenix As promised the food was great the service was great and I got to meet the venerable Thomas

I sat at the bar and the boys took care of me The Fez Kisra sounded good but I should have listened to Russells recommendations I will definitely try those next time which will be soon

The wine selection was varied but didnt blow my mind I stuck with whites and found that the one that sounded the best wasnt nearly as good as the most popular shockingly

The place combines hip and tasteful decorating good music great food and a nightlife atmosphere Definitely seems like a great place for a night out with the guysgirls if you dont want to be overly bothered"
5,Still solid still delicious I love this place
5,"I just wanted to add that in addition to party and catering equipment they also rent heaps of tools and equipment Think hedge trimmers lawn aerators cement mixers  stuff you might need for a once a year or special project and so dont want to invest in the equipment

In our case we needed a chainsaw to take down some dead stuff from last winters freeze an unwelcome sapling a dead tree branches encroaching the roof and to tame some monstrous oleanders

I was just about to head to the tool rental department at that big box home improvement store when a friend mentioned A to Z I gave them a call and their prices were competitive Plus it had that feel good factor of being a local biz

The process was pretty easy We got a thorough tutorial on chainsaw operation and safety and were on our way to some serious arboreal carnage

Pro tip rent on Friday after 4pm You can return it Monday morning and only be charged for one day Saturday since they are closed on Sunday"
5,I can always count on Sacks   It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later Im still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do   I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive   Sacks is my go to place when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too
5,Best Mexican food in phoenix very reasonable prices
1,"After repeat visits it just gets worse  the service that is  It was as if we were held hostage and could not leave for a full 25 minutes because thats how long it took to receive hour check after several requests to several different employees  Female servers might be somewhat cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and this is a brewpub  I asked if they have an seasonal beers and the reply was no that they only sell their own beers  Even more amusing is their industrial pale ale is an IPA but it is not bitter  So they say its an IPA but its not bitter its not a truetostyle IPA  Then people say Oh I dont like IPAs and want something else  Their attempt to rename a beerstyle is actually hurting them  Amazing

The menu was not the regular menu just a small list of about 45 choices  To make it worse the actual menu on every table was wrong yet the kept the menus on the tables anyway  I heard 3 separate tables order the fried raviolis but they did not have them  

This place is only in business because of the location location location"
5,Just want to Say ThankYou Hawaiian Airlines for Making My Grandparents Flight Very Enjoyable They Say Nothing But good things
5,"Brought my parents here for lunch last time they were in town  Dad loved his gyro Mom and I both got large salads hers chicken and mine gyro meat  SO much delicious food for not a lot of money  Between my Mom and Is leftovers I had a full dinner to eat later  

Hooray for pleasing the parents"
5,"Okay so I have a little bit of bias towards Nordstrom  I freaking love Nordstrom  

The store is always clean and the staff are always friendly  I have never had such good service anywhere else  I especially love that Nordstrom will return or exchange an item with no questions asked

Aside from the service the selection is very nice  I always go during the half yearly sale so that I can get some good deals on my designer duds

I am big on shoes and the selection is very good  They always have some cool shoes that I cant seem to live without  Also the staff in the shoe department are very good on helping to make suggestions when I am not sure what I want

If you go go in June or  January when the sales are great  Make sure you check out the shoes"
5,"While I love that it is Native American owned and operated the best thing about this restaurant is the food  as it should be  I dont go out to eat to be entertained or charmed  just fed better than I could be at home and that is exactly what this place does  

The food is amazing The fry bread isnt greasy and I dont know how they do that  The meals are flavorful filling and reasonably priced  The only thing I would do is add some tomatoes to the tacos but that is a minor quibble  

If you want to go out for a delicious meal in a casual place and not pay a lot for it GO NOW to the Fry Bread House"
5,"My wife and I have made two trips to Robertos from Dana Point CA 400 miles and we havent been disappointed  Although its not the only reason for our visit a stop at Robertos is a must when were in the Phoenix area  I have tried and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos beef chimichanga burrito and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas

My wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for two to a plate great presentation and delicious  The light breading allows the flavors of the chili and cheese to dominate the palate as they should

She also recommends the tortas she had at breakfast The bread light and toasted perfectly hugs a generous helping of carne asada with fajita style onions and peppers and if you like guacamole  Pair that with a cup of their terrific coffee or if you have never had Jamaica a delicious Mexican beverage brewed fresh from flowers try it  Either way you have a breakfast you wont forget

Oh and by the way the members of the local fire department showed up to order breakfast while we were there  If they are eating there you know its good  Just had to thank them for their service  

This is truly a restaurant where family meets family Robertos and yours

And for you insiders we both love Robertos homemade tamales  Although theyre not on the menu we have been fortunate enough to take some of their tamales home during both of our visits

I believe tamales are normally made for the sale in the store on Thursdays check with them to be sure but they dont last   On our first trip in 2008 to their old location we stopped in for lunch excellent and were told that they were bringing in homemade tamales that afternoon  We returned that night for dinner and to pick up some tamales that they kept for us

During our most recent trip we stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday  But fortunately for us they were making tamales for a catering job the same day and sold us some of their extras  We again returned in the evening for dinner and to pick up some tamales

These tamales are just like I wish my Chinese grandmother used to make  Check with them to see when theyre available  Theyre really worth the extra effort

Although Robertos delivers I regret that they wont come to Dana Point"
5,"When I mean 5 star I mean 5 STARRbut this place is SPECTACULAR Pavle  Charleen are such a fantastic duothey really know how to make your dining experience exquisite  The food not to mention the service is truly unbelievably delicious If you want to have some amazing food and get top notch service while doing so the time has come for you right here in beautiful Arizona
HATS OFF FOR FnB"
5,WOW  Great donuts  Honestly you cant eat just one  I loved the plain glazed and the oldfashioned  Not like the franchise donut shops these have the real bakery taste
5,Saw this place while I was picking up pizza for my kids  I didnt want pizza thought I would go in and give the tamales a try  I havent regretted that decision at all  The chicken tamales are the BEST  They are super spicy the way I like  The beef with red sauce is great too not very spicy at all  The masa in all the tamales is flavored wonderfully  I am hooked on these tamales
5,I was in Phoenix a few weeks ago on a business trip Lucky me Thai Elephant was right across the street from my hotel This is a tiny little joint maybe 20 tables The menu is like a book there is so much to choose from rice dishes noodle dishes soups appetizers My coworker and I settled on a red curry dish with chicken and I had a sweet  sour dish yeah it sounds trite but I was in the mood and it was so delicious We had tons of leftovers which we shared with a homey down the street I hope he enjoyed it Highly recommended and if Im ever back in town I will visit again
5,"It was 345pm and Im about to jump on a bus to the light rail  We have no reservations for Pizzeria Bianco but a couple of friends just got in line and were waiting to get some wine  Useless fact theyre 26th in line  So in theory at 500 were in the first seating  And so it happens the publiclyunderwritten public transit arrives my oneway trip cost 125 my gfs unvalidated parking fee was 12 and two Hop Knots later were sitting down and waiting  

Typical order one of everything two Biancoverdes  At this point being almost review 200 the details are irrelevant  The crust is great the cheese is great the Sonny Boy is ubersalty and delicious fruity olive oil holy shit these roasted peppers etc  Why is that person staring at me through the window

So I guess the point is if you make it your only point to go to Bianco its hard to be disappointed"
5,Dr Greg Allen is the best doctor in the East Valley and probably the state He has the best of bed side manners and is caring in his listening to the patients needs We have used him for several years and trust him completely
5,INCREDIBLE food relaxedgreat atmosphere perfect to bring kidsfamilythe cheeseburger shredded bbq pork sandwich sweet potatoes too die for Must try Worth the drive
5,"GET THE CIDER Just do it Im a huge cider fan and this is the best Ive ever had Not syrupy sweet and nice and cloudy so you know that its been brewed from actual fruit and not some secret sugar concoction Their master brewer also brews all of their sodas Grab a taster for the sodas and see which one you like best My favorite is the vanilla The staff is ridiculously friendly and willing to answer any questions you have and will have a nice chat with you if theyre not busy 

The sandwiches are quite tasty as well Ive had the Marios Monster Millwich and my boyfriend has had the tuna and the French dip All have been really good but if you dont like a lot of feta on your sandwich I would suggest letting them know because they really pile it on Marios I love it so it was no problem for me"
5,I got the best KEEN hiking boots on sale here and they have a great selection of dog frisbee and dog boots and dog toys I like this location nobody bothers me and I can mill around without anyone bothering me
1,No offense to everyone who gave this place 5 stars but the Tempe Cinema staff needs a swift kick in the ass During school hours this place is regularly crawling with hooligan truants Maybe those who run this theatre want to ensure they will have a steady stream of staffing options from the dropouts who use it as a hideout Losers
5,Everything here is awesome I love the Kung Pao shrimp and the Hong Kong soup which has wontons and and egg noodles they make in house The soup they bring out before your meal is delicious as well Everything tastes made to order always fresh never greasy and is presented beautifully The staff is very friendly and attentive Definitely try this place Its a regular lunch spot for my office They also have great lunch specials 
5,"They have anything from salads pitas wraps burgers and wood fired pizzas  Although this isnt a 100 plantbased restaurant they pride themselves on having many vegan options  Not only are there options but upon visiting their site I found a table of what items are vegan what arent and what makes them nonvegan which is always nice to know Great to have so many vegan options that are spelled out on their website  

We expected a counterservice experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sitdown restaurant  The vibe was a classy yet laid back youthful feel  Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes think Urban Outfitters style  I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though its a sitdown experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling

The food was absolutely FANTASTIC  Oh my For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas  The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil lemon juice fresh garlic and smashed potatoes  If you love garlic youll love this

My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices mixed greens tomatoes onions pickles and tahini  He was very happy with his choice although next time hed ask for no onions

I went with the Veggie Garden Wrap that included zucchini broccoli cauliflower eggplant yellow squash carrots onions tomatoes brown rice mixed beans ginger herbs and garlic

One thing we quickly found was that our entrees were HUGE  This is not a complaint in anyway  However next go around we may share an entree  Either way this visit we had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day

 Will definitely return"
5,NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN AZ From scrambled eggs to their blueberry pancakes Top end Yes you pay for it But its special like Valentines Day Just pay out and enjoy the treat Lunch is also nice especially if you get a seat outside so you can people watch Great wraps and sandwiches Havent tried anything later here yet But I saw their happy hour specials and it is on my TO DO list
5,Great tasting frozen yogurt excellent customer service very clean inside Healthy choice for a sweet treat
5,If you are looking for topnotch produce and organic goodies then NGD is the best Pricing cant be beat and its delivered as well Always great quality and a large selection Easy ordering process and awesome customer service One of the reasons I am sad not to live in Scottsdale anymore
1,I was really excited to try this restaurant and tonight my husband and I came and ordered food to takeout The service was very friendly and the store was clean cute and colorfulbut the food was very disappointing My husband ordered the curry chicken and although it tasted okay he literally almost choked on tiny bones in the meat 4 or 5 times I asked ahead of time if they used white meat and was told yes but the Calypso Pasta I ordered had tiny tiny pieces of dark meat jerk chickeninstead of the boneless white strips I was expecting and really it was just mediocre Im bummed I wanted to like this place
5,"I cant say enough good things about this place 

Quick disclosure When I was working for the Downtown YMCA I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fundraising campaign Local Breeze was totally down to contribute So on top of getting that delicious meal know that your money is largely going back to the community Awesome

But the food and drinks are really what keep me coming back The cocacola ham is delish and the serving sizes are pretty decent You definitely get your moneys worth And theres a reason why my profile says that my recent discovery is spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze That was written months ago but I dont think Ive discovered anything quite as amazing yet And I normally dont even like cottage cheese

The last time I went was for my bday dinner and again it didnt let me down We had good food good drinks and a good time in general The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini which sounds weird but if youre a martini fan go for it If youre feeling less risky you cant go wrong with their mojito"
5,"This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment yet I have passed by it daily This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close I have noticed the parking lot is usually full so I thought it must be good I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect

It was Sunday morning just around 930 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee The menu is a little newspaper and its a bit overwhelming with many options but I finally settled on the volcano It is described as three pancakes 2 sausage links 2 bacon strips and an egg The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top It was under 9 and I was surprised at the size of it I attempted but could not finish it The big pancake was left uneaten They do have a smaller option for around 6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone 

The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee I dont know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full people were milling around the parking lot and the wait to be seated was 15 minutes"
5,So perfect The atmosphere is just spot on I love going whether its just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill I love their Apple Harvest  salad So delicious and beautifully prepared Baristas are always very nice especially Brianna Cant wait to hopefully become a regular and attend some of the live music events they put on every week
5,"Excellent customer service super clean and the foods not bad at all  Despite the fact that I asked for extra mayo on my sammy but got NO mayo was a little annoying  But for some reason something told me to pick up some packets of mayo  So I was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning  That and the sandwich was pretty yummo  They also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it

I do not however recommend the chocolate chip cookie  No bueno"
1,"From my door its a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes They have a nice patio They have enough TVs to show all MLBNFLNBA games They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables Yet Ive only been to Dukes a few times and I am not going back This place is just bad

Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers such as bottled sour mix for margaritas They offer a pretty basic beer selection I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced but that might be only when theyre on special

The food is pretty bad even for bar food And pricey Sure the menu is gigantic and Ive tried many different items but I didnt find anything good Everything seems to be made from freezer to fryer or packaged products Im not exaggerating the burger and fries for about 8 is a thin previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries I could go on about salads sandwiches and ribs In the same price range you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devils Advocate

One of the owners was there on a few occasions I guess being the boss of and drinking in his own bar is some sort of dream of his He treats the place like his kingdom Hell ask patrons how is everything and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say I feel bad for the rest of the service staff they seem to be above average but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesnt matter

In this city sports bars are a dime a dozen Id rather go elsewhere"
1,Wow  Is this the new Barcelona  Yuck  Old scuzy men and middle aged women with fake boobs that are falling out of their painted on dresses  All bars were completely under staffed on a Friday night  We waited 7 minutes at the front bar until being ignored continuously and we became so frustrated that we made our way to the round bar and it seemed just as understaffed  Whats the point of only having a few bartenders on probably the busiest night of the week for bargoers  We even approached the blond manager to ask for service and she was completely rude and had a total lack of desire to help us  We will NOT return due to the lack of service and efficiency  This place has GOT to staff more bartenders and needs much more help  Welcome to North Scottsdale Barcelona
5,"I traveled to Phoenix often for work from the early 90s to the late 00s and the first thing Id do leaving the airport was to hit the Pink Pepper lunch buffet hence Ive never ordered from the menu or had their dinner service but their lunch buffet was awesome  Very reasonably priced including an iced tea  It may not necessarily be the most authentic Thai food as I think they reduce the heat a bit but the flavors were excellent and the variety was good  Loved their eggplant dish cant recall the name and their crispy chicken with the creamy sauce and of course the usual curry sauce dishes

If Im ever back in Phoenix again the Pink Pepper will be one of the first places I go"
5,"OK being from Wisconsin the land of the great lakes I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that yes there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona  The Lake Saguaro Lake is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dameven so its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest  I was amazed frankly at how beautiful this tour was  Sold for 18 for 90 minutes you get your moneys worth  But that is probably not what you want to hear

The event is a combination of 1 the scenery and also 2 the charm of the paddle boat itself  The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people  Its an event that you could share with family but I happened to be there with friends  Currently its a pretty mellow type of event great for Mothers Day although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows Jazz ensembles stargazing and a variety of other events

PS  They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics weddings and the like"
1,So what kind of place serves chicken fingers and NO Ranch dressing The only sauces they had was honey mustard and Canes Secret sauce Can I say EEWWWW I thought that the sauce tasted terrible I am not too big a fan of honey mustard but I do On occasion eat it if there is nothing else And that wasnt even good The coleslaw was awful also I do have to say that the chicken fingers were very juicy but also very bland Those were the only 2 items that I tried not that there were really any more items  on the menu Texas toast And Fries I think Overall I would never go back
5,"Had the pastrami sandwich It brought me back memories of living in NYC and eating that first pastrami It was good  Good food hAs the power of time travel 

This is a great place Plus the coke is primo Good mixture The ice makes it over the top"
1,I hadnt been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years now I know why  Cashier was nice and very helpful  I ordered bacon cheese burger combo  Fries were only warm not hot  Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits you know the ones that stick between your teeth  Lots of trash on the floor  After we were finished someone came to ask how things were  I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more I declined  She offered a free dessert I accepted  In all not a good experience will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back
5,Edens Grill has to be one of my favorite and newly discovered Middle EasternMediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro Located in a sleepy strip mall close to Arties Ace is EG My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything We started off with the hummus followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades falafel rice veggie skewers and veggie patties 2 The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious Next time well pay the extra 5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious however I find EGs hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus Overall I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle EasternMediterranean food but be warned they arent open for lunch on the weekends yet
5,"Consistent is a great word to describe this place The food is consistently great the service is consistently great the regulars are consistently there theyre great too It has a comfortable smokingdrinking patio and great prices during happy hour The staff and owner is always consistently accommodating and friendly You feel like you are part of the family here 

Food Id recommend Any fish served Greek style the Prime Rib the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar"
5,"How have I gone this long without reviewing the lodge Sheesh I get all fluttery inside when I think about the lodge The Mac and Cheese is not something to play around with It is a dish of fantastic cheesy wonderfulness Also please note the veggie wrap HOLY SMOKES Its a heavenly combo of sauteed veggies feta cheese and some kind of lemonherbheaven sauce all wrapped up in a pita Really Really Aaron May

The other aspects of the lodge I enjoy involve the friendly staff and comfortable setting Its decorated all rustic and cushy and true to form there are antlerchandeliers You will also find pool tables darts several TVs jenga bean bag gamesthey have plenty going on at the lodge to keep you and your friends entertained Check it out"
5,"Just went for my first time last night with the girls Two of us heard about it and after I read the reviews and checked out the menu it was slated for our next night out
Anyway we had a memorable evening with wine the makeyourown cheeseboard and the todiefor pear and gorganzola flatbread pizza It was topped with fried sage leaves  different and delicious Afterward we were able to fit dessert and shared a huge slice of fresh layer cake filled and frosted with dark chocolate Sublime Cant wait to go back and try other dishes  definitely made it to my Restaurants to Frequent list "
5,"I really enjoyed my manipedi with Trisha  She took her time and taught me about manicuring my nails from home which I loved

I went in for the Groupon basic manipedi deal and left feeling like I got a lot more It was the most pleasant experience Ive had at a nail salon The conversation was easy and Trish is a great person I will be coming back to Trish for nails again 

The entire staff was friendly and professional Great Salon"
5,Mister Softee is an allstar he showed up on time provided great service and has great tasting ice cream Give him a call 
5,"Awesome food anyone Go check out Modern Steak in Scottsdale AZ
Gorgeous dining room Excellent service with our server Gabe And the food was AAAMMMAZZING

Its located at Fashion Mall but its NOT a mall restaurant A MUST go"
5,"Dudea happy hour that is TRULY happy  

This joint is relatively swank for all the deals it has  Nice decor good bar FRESH seafood seriouslythis is some good quality  Starting at 400 pm they have 5 martinis AND 075 oysters  YUM

On top of that they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate a GIANT crab cake a salads and shrimp dishes  All are tasty

For all the Zoners out there yeah I said it you have to check out this place  You will have a great time 

NOTE  beware of dirty old men  Theyll hit on your friends"
5,So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barbs bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish
5,"I can now thank the Humane Society for not only giving me my dog Brutus when I was a child but now my dog Harley as an adult A couple of years ago I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf of my old company When I scheduled the meeting they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals I said of course and planned my visit However I knew that with a tour I might be in some trouble in the willpower department 

When I arrived to the center I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new parents waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home 

To make a long story shorter they gave us a detailed tour of the complex I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all kinds just wanting a home As I walked up to one of the cages a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage I fell in love immediately To make matters worse the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice Of course I had to give it to my new found friend At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog So to end that part of my story I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense 

While I visited the Humane Society I couldnt get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves They were clean kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me A staffer stayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had When I made the decision to take Harley home with me they neutered him gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats food and a leash They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Societya nonprofit 

This Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pets stay until they find a new home I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how wellkept it is They even have horses that they rescued Sorry folks they are not up for adoption though So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets"
5,Awesome awesome awesomeeverything was fantastic The innovative drink menu the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable A I would definitely recommend this place to everyone Bant wait to return
5,"HoleintheRock is a cavelike natural rock formation sculpted into the top of a sandstone butte in Phoenixs beautiful Papago Park Its one of the most powerful scenic views in our city and is the perfect place to showcase its exquisite landscape Just a short hike up the butte and youll find yourself in the amazing chamber sculpted over millions of years of wind and water erosion 

At sunset there are few locations that can rival its awesomeness The hole faces south giving a wonderful view over south Phoenix all the way to South Mountain  

HoleintheRock is truly one of the greatest attractions in our city and everyone would be blessed to experience it at least once 

No fee to enter Bring a camera"
5,"Flatiron Mesa is one of my favorite hikes in the Phoenix area Like other reviewers have stated once youve gotten used to Squaw and Camelback give this one a try  Itll kick your ass  Its about a 2600 climb in elevation so youre doing more like 25 Camelbacks Youll be scrambling over boulders most of the way up since there really arent switchbacks Id say give yourself about 5 hours to go up and down  Its inside Lost Dutchman State Park so you will need to pay an entry fee

My one recommendation besides the obvious ones being fit pack food and water is to bring some light gloves  Since youre climbing up and down on all those boulders your hands will probably get a little scratched up

Dont feed the wildlife"
5,"Ive been going to Lake Pleasant Dentistry for 23 years now and Dr Sharon Bader is handsdown the best dentist Ive ever had  Ive traditionally had bad experiences with dentists and am always wary of any dental procedure but Ive never felt more comfortable than with Dr Bader

She is very accommodating puts you at ease explains all the options and does GREAT work and will stand behind it  She did a pretty complex crown for me when the tooth was borderline whether it could be saved and it worked out great  I wouldnt hesitate to recommend this practice to anyone"
5,"What happened to this place  The food was good and seemed to have passionate folks who worked there

What a shame  I think many were only just discovering it"
5,Pleasant courteous  low prices and your clothes are ready the next day What more could you ask for
5,Its pretty awesome here  I was traveling in Phoenix for work and had to get my raw food fix I eat a raw diet at home and as much as I can while traveling and this was excellent  The portions were large and the price was good  The same type of food in places like Chicago are much more expensive  I got the raw tacos for lunch and the blueberry fields salad togo  They were both great  I also had an appetizer but that ended up being too much food so I packed it too  The location is actually fairly close to the airport 10 min drive and so it will be my preferred place to go when Im in Phoenix
5,"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ Ive had in Arizona 

The service was great as well The manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good

UPDATE 
Looks like they went out of business Havent been open for two weeks now"
5,I went in at 8 on a Thursday night and the place was pretty empty except for a family of 4 eating  The layout is a little strange it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant  The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there which is pretty rare these days  She suggested I do the slider plate which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread  It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there  The sliders were awesome all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork  The green chili mac and cheese was also very good which was somewhat surprising to me  I was expecting Stouffers with pickled jalapenos stirred in but it was far from that  For being the end of the night it was very fresh and cheesy  The only part of the meal that wasnt great was the cornbread but I dont think you can really do much to cornbread to make it wow you anyway  I definitely like this better than Honey Bears and it doesnt even compare to the BBQ joke Famous Daves  When I have tailgate this year Andrews will definitely be my go to place for everything  Also my meal only ran me about 850 and it was very filling and worth every penny
5,Service is always great and the waiters are plesant and nice to have serve you  This is one of my favorite breweries to come too  They have a good selection of beer that is made in house and you can also get a growler of any type to take home or home made root beer which is also amazing  I have never had anything less than a great meal in the around 60 times I have ate here
1,Everything about this company sucks Walmart treats their customers and employees horribly I mean HORRIBLY They destroy the communities in which they sit Im done never shopping here again I dont care how cheap something might be there is a high cost to low prices afterall
5,"Great little restaurant  The staff is super friendly and their happy hour specials are pretty amazing  I got thePanko crusted Tipalia which was a little dry but my girlfriends stuffed mahi mahi was delicious  The Horchata bread pudding was really good too  They have a nice patio where most of the customers sit I will be bringing my dog with me next time  

It is a bit expensive so be prepared to drop some money but its definitely worth checking out"
5,The best bar in town
5,I m psycho for this place  The sell cupcakes now Ollie Cake  and have longer hours of operations I believe  I want to say until 7  NOM NOM NOM
5,Lived in house for 9 years and just thought was time to replace the carpeting had used some of those 99 room services over the years for routine cleaning met Ray Odom Owner of HydroPro and gave them a crack at cleaning the carpets before I replaced them I was Amazed at results by the time they were done the carpets looked brand new took their time and did incredibally throrugh job  Great service at reasonable pricewell worth it My carpet cleaner from now on
5,"Let me start by saying that I love tacos I eat lots of tacos When I get hungry one of the first things to cross my mind is tacos That said I love El Nopalito for their tacos Im pretty picky about my tacos I dont really like dumbass flour tortillas dry tacos unseasoned meat in a taco taco bell is not tacos the list goes on I prefer authentic Mexican street tacos

That being said El Nopalito is the one place in town I feel like I am getting the most authentic street taco that I have been able to find in Phoenix The only reason I am not here more often is the commute is a bit much as I live in the East Valley  However if I am anywhere near the area it is almost mandatory to stop and have at least a taco or two I recommend trying all of the tacos though my favourite has to be the cabeza it sounds creepy but is buttery and delicious

It does help if you speak Spanish as it will make ordering and asking any questions you may have easier"
5,This place is heavenly I have dreams about it on a regular basis The cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors TASTY
5,Yum best donuts in Phoenix
5,Alright we are going to say that this place is Awesome  The service is outstanding and the food wonderful    We came here for Breakfast on Sunday Morning              They were very busy but we did not have to wait too long at all                                    Our server Colleen was great   She greeted us right away and  brought our drinks very quickly   The food was very good and just love their Potatoes  The menu is fantastic Lots to choose from We like the decor and lots of parking in the lot Nice Place and we will be back
5,"This place is a gem The food is amazing Its cheap The service is good My favorite part The place never changes I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their handmade pita  so soft and delicious The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce Ive never found better hummus in my life Ive had it all around town in New York in LA ickLA shudder SO good The iced tea has a hint of rose water OH and the gyro Hands down the best in town

Did I mention they have a market attached Talk about the best price on spices in town The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up

I couldnt get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue I am no connoisseur of organ meats but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb youve ever had in your life Shut up and try it

The only sad part about Hajis is that they close early Usually 8pm on a weeknight but totally worth getting togo orders if you can swing in on your way home from work"
5,We decided to eat here on a whim My husband got the burger brûlée and I got the beach house burger Both were fantastic The buns were perfect and we both agreed these were the best burgers we had had in a really long time The sweet potato tater tots and French fries were also amazing For 27 it fed our family of five Im definitely going back Friendly service casual atmosphere and clean Thumbs up all the way
5,"I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago my boyfriend suggested I give it a try Since Im very picky with mexican food places I had doubts but boy was I wrong All I can say is wow This place is amazingly delicious I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house This can be a good thing but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight 


This place is so good I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again"
1,"Bad experienceTerrible service terrible food

First of all I was organizing a Happy Hour and Dinner for a retirement party that we had on Friday August 3rd 2012  Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices

Second of all our server was awful  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people  Anyways she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed rushed rushed  Then a new person came in late on our table and she was not even served when she saw her  We had to track her down I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to this was the worst service ever  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived

I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes 12 order of fried okra and a plate of sweet potato fries  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch I dont cook much but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant I told the server I ordered 12 size of fried okra and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 12 size order  

And lastly when the server gave us the bill it was all separate checks and did not even do that right  The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check

So needless to sayI AM NOT COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN"
5,One of my favorite places to go with the kids for lunch  Bring a small amount of   grab yourself a table under the trees and enjoy the afternoon away while your kids play within eyesight  The entire patio is really a large fenced grassy tree filled area with 2 volleyball courts multiple gathering areas ping pong horse shoes jumbo checkers and even another fenced in area full of sand and toys for the kids
5,Love this place Great Happy Hour
1,Nasty workers and over priced trash
5,Dr Jones was very friendly and understanding
5,Great librarytake your canned food to donate all during APRIL and they wave off your fines GREAT cause GREAT deal and now fine free
5,I have been meaning to stop in but keep driving on by  I am SO GLAD that I stopped I was pleased the moment I walked in  The store is well lit and cheery the books line the wall making you feel like youre walking into a oasis of knowledge  I found 10 copies of the book I was looking for I needed 10 copies and the owner said he will order me copies of two books he didnt have  Also he offered his community room for my book club  So nice very friendly definitely the kind of place we want to encourage
5,The best gluten free pizza Absolutely loved the avacado pizza So delicious The wait staff was great very friendly and invited us to a wine tasting while we waited  Parking is limited but certainly not an issue to complain about
1,"The portions are too small the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box the serving tray is right from a mall food court and the menu selection is drastically reduced  You cant really enjoy conversation or relax at lunch listening to the kitchen scream out order numbers to the customers  The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun but gimmicky  The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part but you do leave wanting more

I wont be returning to this location"
5,I went in to check out the new drop of denim that the boys at The Phoenicia Association got in and left with a new pair of Naked and Famous Raw Selvedge Denim Weird Guy cut and a shirt by Wrath Arcane with the sickest little pocket that drops from your breast to your waist perfect for my lighter and cigs with a little zipper at the bottom Spent a nice chunk of dough but nothing crazy for such a nice combo I can wear to dinner with the parents or to Old TownDowntown on a Saturday night
5,The best food I have found the area and the price is right  You get so much food you have to take home  Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch  Priced just right
5,I love breweries and I love Four Peaks One of e best breweries in Az We came here on a Friday night but had no trouble getting a table This place is huge and packed but still room to move around We ordered the Hopshot IPA which is a great beer  Ive been here a few time and always had a good experience I cant wait till the pumpkin porter coming Oct 1st
1,"Cold under done chips If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right  I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having Every table had chips and salsa on it Sombreros were used as the server platters Senor I dont think this even meets health code 

Dinner was served Buffet Style one of the dishes was called fandito I cant think of a less inspired dish It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights 

I like really like Mexican food however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad"
5,"Great service by Angela and their Doc
First time I dont have to wear reading glasses as they switched me to a mono contact
Very enjoyable experience and very quick
Had a issue with a contact and they track a replacement done right away
Definitely recommend"
5,"My wife and I finally tried CPH and were greatly surprised by everything  The food as expected was superior along with the professionalism of the staff  The ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably  
We began the nigth with a bottle of wine the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp  All were exceptional  As out main courses my wife orded the sea scallops and I ordered the short ribs  Peter of Cowboy Ciaos must miss this guy  Both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone  For dessert we had coffee and the evenings special the donut holes with three dipping sauces  All were fantastic  The wife and I dont usually rate places with five stars but this place actually gets how food and service are meant to be as one  Cant wait until we head back"
5,"Some might say that Phoenix is a city without much culture  That may be true in some aspect however we have to remember that Phoenix is a young large city compared to other cities that lie within the United States  So you can say that this city is a work in progress on catching up with everyones culture expectations

The Japanese Friendship Garden in downtown Phoenix is only seven years old  Very new to the park scene for this metro I have to say that it looks great and will only keep getting better in time  That will happen if people stop saying there is no culture in Phoenix and become a part of the evolving city by visiting places such as this  The admission and or donations will fund a more desired park for all

The grounds of the garden are very beautiful with a nice flowing stream several waterfalls coy fish and many species of plants  I cant wait to go back in the next several years to see it become a wonderful masterpiece"
5,"This is a very special medical practice with customer service and attention to detail that you hardly ever see in a doctors office anymore I started seeing Dr Ross for Osteopathic Manipulation after having a few back surgeries He has given me tremendous relief and I highly recommend OMT rather than chiropractic treatment since it works with the tissue and muscles as well as the bones Anyways He listens and takes time to treat your WHOLE body unlike most doctors that have one hand on the door knob as they speak to you 

I saw a Naturopath in the past and saw Cheryl the PA for the first time the other day She took a lot of time with me going through my blood work line by line I was so please that she suggested supplements and knew about things that I learned from the Naturopathbut actually she knew about more supplements than the Naturopath So I was really pleased 

This is a great office and everyone is like familythey also treat you like you are a part of their family They make your children feel comfortable too There are tons of Mickey Mouse figures and videos for them to watch The nurses have always loved on my daughter since she was a baby They make sure that all of us have a productive appointment I highly recommend this office"
5,Best prices and a huge selection I love their single bottles of beer isle where you can mix and match your own 6pack of beer Some of my favorite beers I can only find here
5,"This is the old location For current reviews look up Karens Kreamery Cafe Here is what I posted for the new locationplease give it a chance I do not know the owners I just love supporting a good local business
Great ice cream super cute store extremely CLEAN The ice cream is good service is always great and the location is fun although a little out of the way The prices are reasonable I would rather support a locally owned business and pay more than McDonalds prices and less than Cold Stone prices If you havent been and plan on visiting in the Summer bring suits for the kids There is a nice little splash area right next to a big playground Karens Kreamery is located in a big parksports facility There is also a medium sized skate park We usually make a fun outing out it My family loves this place Support local businesses"
5,"All around great food  True Texas brisket experience  Meat has great flavor and tasty sides add variety to the offerings  Dont forget about the sheet cake for dessert  Ill be back  

Read another review on here talking about wings  They dont have wings here  Get your reviews right people"
5,"This is my neighborhood Chinese Restaurant and a family staple  I personaly like the roasted  peking duck  The Shrimp LoMein is good Fast Friendly Service No MSG
Lunch Specials  during the week are awesome too"
1,"This was my second visit to Arribas and believe me it wasnt my choice I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY especially green chile When you walk into Arribas its New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state

When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesnt have pork in it she said Well we say that but its not really New Mexican and walked off What

The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation had these interactions been better this review wouldnt be here

Im far from being a vegetarian I dont eat pork or beef because I dont like it Also I didnt ask about the red chile sauce because Im not a fan maybe its porkless and amazing but I cant speak for that

I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad  Iceberg lettuce slimy greens cooked onions and bell peppers mushy tomatoes half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell yuck 

If it wasnt for the delicious fresh chips guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I wouldve been VERY unhappy  I definitely wont ever be back and this time I mean it"
1,Sadly disappointed  Ive passed Lolas an uncountable number of times and each time thought I needed to try it  I finally did tonight and was terribly disappointed  For anyone that has been to Firefly in Las Vegas there is just no comparison  The sangria was decent but nothing special and the tapas were just so so  The atmosphere was busy and our service sucked but it was a very unique and cool environment
5,"I used to shop her constantly when I live right across the street and I still make the drive up there even though the prices are higher than Safeway Why

The staff rocks Need a certain type of wine They know where to find it Need a spice Thats covered too Every employee is courteous and most importantly SPEAKS FLUENT ENGLISH

Their deli rocks my socks Always fresh and always tasty Ive purchased more than a few dinners and have never been disappointed

The ready to cook stuff is delicious too In the mood for some kind of meat stuffed with a vegetable andor cheese This is the place

I also loved the fresh food cooked every day right in the store From BBQ to MASSIVE Sunday omelets the choices are a plenty Again not cheap but you certainly get your moneys worth Go early if you want the breakfast they run out quick

And you can buy good beer by the bottle Dogfish Head rocks"
5,"Since moving to Arizona I have selected Frys as my new grocer and am very happy with my choice I immediately signed up for their VIP card and love seeing the many savings listed on the receipt after every trip

I am especially happy that I have moved closer to this Frys as it is open 24 hours and even when shopping in the wee hours of the morning can expect to see some nocturnal ASU students

Any interactions I have had with the staff have been pleasant and enjoyable"
5,Great decor Great food and very good service You have to try the pork belly pastrami To die for Their version of the Manhattan was very good As for the main courses you cant go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck For dessert go with the black  tan pudding Oh soooo good Highly recommend this place
5,Ditto what Kristi M said  Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this place
5,Four Peaks serves up some great beers and great eats  This is no secret so no matter which day out of the year or which hour and minute out of the day you go you will see a full patio and a populated bar  Plan accordingly  Try their Italian beer bread the Carne Adovada or the Southwest burger and wash it down with a pint of Hop Knot or Kilt Lifter  You will be happy you did  All of Four Peaks menu items are appropriately priced and you will always leave satisfied
5,"Wow this place is fabulous  Everything is so fresh and tasty that you can enjoy a healthy and yummy meal without breaking the bank  The salad bar is huge and they have a fresh soup bar where you can choose numerous varieties of homemade soups  Great tasting desserts and frozen yogurt machine  Best Strawberry Lemonade I have ever tasted  You have to try this place you will not be disappointed  They need to open locations in the Midwest

Also I want to give a shout out to the server at the restaurant  His name is Oscar and he is so wonderful and funny  He made us all laugh and smile and Oscar is such a hard worker and everyone that visits this location has to say hello to Oscar because he is the nicest man ever"
5,"Always love the ALofts
If youve stayed at one theyre pretty much the same
Rooms were clean and comfortable
There was plenty of room in the standard king room
Bathroom was nice you dont have to deal with the miniature shampoos theyre in the wall mounted containers which is nice
Only thing missing is an iron and ironing board but other than that the room was perfect especially if you like hip modern decor which I do  Rooms are a notch above TheStandard in LA but not quite as roomy  The rest of the property was just OK yes they have a lounge but need a restaurant  This location also does not have a DJ as some of the other ALofts do
All in all though probably one of the best hotels to stay in while in the Phoenix area especially for the price  I heard from the bartender that the one in Tempe is more live than this one"
5,I have always loved this place   Good Food fair price  and typically a couple of cute girls working there  All around good place   its a go to 
5,"Sanctuary youve been replaced  Willow Stream Spa is my new fav spa spot  Loved Loved the service
Robe got slightly damp from use helpful attendant appears and gives me a new one  Loved the waterfall treatment  Loved private rooftop pool  Loved the attendant walking around giving us sun bathers bottles of cold water  Loved the fitness classes the facility
All this for 50 during AZ Spa Week  
The facility and service is so fabulous here that I would come here anytime and think every penny I spent was worth it"
5,"I cant believe this wasnt reviewed yet  This place rocks and Dr Heather is the very best vet in town Shes reasonable in price thorough in her evaluations and super kind She handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly and she talks about her own pets and has compassion 

When our cat Everett died she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes  she had made a single footprint ornament with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift  Never had a vet do anything so kind  

We have had MANY cats and MANY VETS  I know a good vet Go here Please go here"
5,probably my favorite restaurant 
5,This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd Ive been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and its the same ever since GREAT Cookies and bread are awesome as well
5,This place had me from the moment our waitress asked us if it was ok if our water was infused with the flavor of cucumber  Heck yeah it was ok in fact I dont even want to order a drink I just want the free cucumber water  My buddy and I decided to start with an app order of sweet potato waffle fries with dipping sauce  Delightful  I ordered the sweet potato and garbonzo burger and the sweet potato and avocado salad side dish  Notice the sweet potato theme  I love those crazy orange taters  The food was really tasty and quite flavorful  The burger was a little different than I expected because it didnt come on a bunbut no biggie  In typical girl fashion my buddy and I split a cupcakefinger lickin good  I am pickypicky but this place won me over big time  Also I felt that for the location their prices were very reasonable  The prices for those condos located upstairswell thats gotta be a different story
5,"If you dont love Guissepes you dont love Italian Kindly find your way to a chain restaurant that serves bland unseasoned frozenthenmicrowaved meats sauces that are fit for an old folks home and an endless pasta and salad bar Go to these places because Guissepes is not for you  Its for lovers of true NorthernNortheast American Italian cuisine Chicken Parm that is fried NOT baked thank you very much Meatballs that use beef veal and pork Sauce that use LOTS of salt as it should be Leave your dietary worries at home

 In a word perfecto

Roberts passion for music hes a well known accomplished cellist in NY circles and food is unparalleled He is without peer in the state of Arizona 

But be warned there aint no endless pasta bowl here
 
Their weekday lunches are equally superior This is Italian the way we had it growing up in North Jersey"
5,"BEAUTIFUL Phoenix doesnt get much more amazing then when youre looking down at her from Dobbins Lookout

A few tips
1 Get there before 6pm The park closes the entry but if youre in you can stay as long as you want 
2 Be ready for a drive up a mountain  scary cliffs and tight corners Make sure you go slow watch for hikers and cyclists and overall be cautious
3 If youre heading to the summit for the views Dobbins Lookout bring a jacket or blanket Its cold and windy when the sun goes down even in the summer

There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout"
5,Took Travis here for one of our first dates and just LOVE Cibo  Its situated in a home from 1913 and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees  You can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio  Brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered here and its definitely a place for a cool date
1,The reviews were so good that my friend and I had to check it out We were very disappointed this morning while trying to eat breakfast and swatting tons of flies They were everywhere on us our food the other customers  and this was inside  The egg sandwiches were served on hamburger buns shaped like rolls  I could have went next door to get one just like it at McDonalds  Not surprised people from Ahwatukee like this place it looks nice but the food is soso
5,"I dont think my husband will let me rate it anything less than 5 stars 

Parking for us was okay since we did not park in the lot we parked at neighboring house for 5 bucks  Grabbed some towels from the hotel and staked out our claim on the lawn People were very friendly  My hubby met some folks from Dixon IL the day before and they came by to say Hi and of course watching the Cubbies  cant beat that"
5,"We were shopping at the Bass Pro Shop in Tempe and decided to go for ice cream to kill some time before dropping my parents off at the airport I pulled out my iPad and yelped ice cream It brought up 4 options in the area and we chose Dairy Queen which was a few blocks away

As luck would have it there was no left turn onto Dobson and we ended up going East on the 202 the opposite direction of the Dairy Queen  So I searched again and we came up with Yogurtland  It wasnt luck after all but some ice cream higher power at work to bring us to our frozen yogurt oasis in Yogurtland  Not only were the ingredients fresh and delicious but the price was reasonable as well 5 of us each had a scrumptious  generously portioned sundae and our total bill was less than 20

We all enjoyed our selections  One topping surprise was the Fruit Pebbles cereal my daughter put on her sundae  The fruity crunch they added was delish  

Yogurtland was a home run  Thanks For the Yelp"
5,Great product I was on a mission to make homemade mozzarella with the absolute best ingredients I could find Organic whole raw milk   this certainly did the trick Well be going back thats for sure
5,"Ive been giving a lot of 5star reviews lately but in my opinion they all deserve it  

Movies on Central RULES  They have 999 of every movie title weve looked for  Since summer started weve been in there at least once a week  Bonus  they have a water cooler right by the door  Sweet"
5,"I cant believe it took me this long to visit Sportsmans but now that I have I know Ill be making my way back soon enough Sportmans is a combination wine bar and retail store for spirits wine champagne and beer galore Plus its locally owned by the Bashas family 

I like Sportsmans because its a friendly and warm atmosphere and they have a great variety of discounts for their different levels of alcohol The walls are lined from the floor to the ceiling with every type of alcohol The prices range from 10  thousands of dollars Its pretty easy to find any type of brand here Since its the holiday season they are currently offering sales on several of their highend brands which makes it easy to visit for the purchase of a gift I also like the fact that guests can visit the intimate bar area and sip on some beverages to take a break from shopping They also make customized gift baskets"
5,"Great views great food great service and great atmosphere  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here and couldnt believe the neighborhood special  3 courses for 35

The split pea soup was amazing as well as the bing cherry cheesecakeyum"
5,I bought the HomeRun offer for a bike tune up at Trailhead  I have to say that I was surprised at the quality of the service they did to my Trek hybrid bike I could definitely tell the bike was riding better smoother more efficient They even reinstalled my bike computer threading the wire around the front right fork very neatly  I definitely recommend this place Oh and the food is good too
5,Great food and even better beer Staff are always friendly  My favorite microbrewery in the Valley
5,"After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappas So I went last night and YAHUMMEE I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint Perfectly grilled scallops 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails 4 huge shrimp brochette If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno wrapped in bacon and char grilled DELICIOUSNESS It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 2295 

I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce WOOHOO FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank 

Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight Bon Appetite"
5,"Im glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted  Im not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door  We arrived at 1115 doors opened at 11 and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not the event was sold out 

Once inside it was a sea of cupcakes  Tiny cupcakes that were delicious  I didnt taste one that I didnt like  Liberty Market was my fave I think  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet  YUM  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch Im going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market  And everyone was so nice  

10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk  And it was for two very worthy causes  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals  There were also raffles a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then once inside charge for everything else  People cant afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything  I appreciate that  And best of all my daughter had a great time  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high  

It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S helping with emcee duties  

Will I be back next year  You bet  And you should come toojust make sure you get your tickets early"
5,Our administrative assistant at work is a big fan of Berthas  And now I am too  Shes ordered in lunch from Berthas a couple of times  The first time it was the Thai chicken salad which I loved  Today we had two salads and a sandwich tray  I dont even like sandwiches  I helped myself to both salads and picked up a sandwich intending to dismantle it and eat the meat and cheese  Inexplicably I took a bite of the sandwich and said OMG  This is so good  It was the turkey wbacon and avocado sandwich  My friend seated directly to my left said Lets go to Berthas and order more of these after lunch  They were truly that good  The salads were both great too  I think well be frequenting Berthas a lot in the immediate future
5,I dont know what I would do if this store ever closed  Its right near our home has an excellent selection of both wine meats and produce  Note that wine is mentioned first I cant help it  The service is always really good too  Everyone who works here seems like they really love their job  The only issue I have ever had was not being able to get basil a couple of times  I got over it  D
5,I always look forward to a haircut with my fave Barber David 13 always gets me the cut I want I used to head down to a another Barber off of Central Ave but never got the haircut I wanted Now I never have to worry about that So if youre ever in need of a Barber shop cut give David or one of his gals a try Cheers
5,My van broke down and I needed a tow real fast because I had my kids with me in the heat I looked up towing on my phone and just happened to pick Leyvas I am so glad I did I spoke with Chris and he was very nice and helpful The driver was there within 20 minutes and was also so so nice to me and my kids He was very clean and professional and courteous  The whole experience was better than I have every had with a towing company I keep their card in my wallet now and gladly refer them
5,"Delicious food amazing martinis and wonderful desserts Every dish I have eaten here has been nothing short of awesome First to start they have house infused seasonal vodkas You can see the vodkas steeping on the bar when you walk in Appetizers are not overly filling  The frito misto is always seasonal so depending on the time of year you will get different things The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch The same is true with the mozzarella The cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect 

As far as entrees go the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful The pasta is perfectly cooked and coated with whatever you choose on the menu I love the simplicity of some and the complexity of others Finally desert has always been good Try the limoncello cheesecake or any flavor of gelato and you certainly wont be disappointed"
5,Perfect burritos polite staff with a couple cuties working here  I love Chipotle
5,A few years ago my husband bought me a gift certificate for this spa Oh my god  it was the most beautiful spa I had ever went to I had a facial and a massage In addition to that  I got unlimited day usage of their spa stuff They had a beautiful locker room that had a sauna and jacuzzi in it An secluded area where you could lay outside  naked They also had a huge pool out behind the spa where you could just layout and be lazy Oh also they had some sitting rooms with magazines fire places oh my goodness It was awesome AND  the prices werent that high compared to other spas in the valley Check it out if you can
1,"Let me start by saying after my experience I surly wish they had half or quarter stars and I am not often found with a lack of words but this is going to take some effort to stomach

Strolled into this establishment at about 130 am now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations

Place is moderately busy as we walk in I get to the counter order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with 2 drink cups Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one Yuck Gf didnt catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own


Fast forward a few minutes guy is in there  his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing  But Lets let that go because its busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am



Fast forward 10 minutes Tell the guy the ice machine is out several minutes later They fill it Again its busy no big deal on that one and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited Im a wishful thinker

Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by place was trashed I go back up and ask the guy for our order He said oh sorry forgot I was amused but its just sliced pizza and a pretzel He tosses them in the oven and a couple minutes later I get them Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza pretzel was hard as a rock and couldnt eat it


Then the show starts there had been a few people in there that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above

Short list

employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand receiving moneythen is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND Placing it in the oven all with out gloves This occurs over and over then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps Um Where did these guys come from did they wash their hands eww  So in the 45 minutes I am in hereno hand washing no gloveshis hands on food toppings money hands face along with all over surfaces possible Freaking DISGUSTING

But it gets better His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands This happens no less than 10 times

Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom Um what Yes That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drugs one can only speculate His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person

Where I will give this guy a couple points is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anywaysbut was surprised at this point 

At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didnt eat much He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didnt finish 

He took it in stride with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment 



In short Ill be contacting the owner of this location 

I do realize this is a late night food offering I do realize the clientele but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call


I will be back very soon if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector


Thanks for reading this little novel"
5,We live by and love this place Happy hour is most def the biggest bang for your buck Try the shrimp boil but only if you like your shrimp a little spicy
5,Gallo Blanco has the most delicious ceviche Ive ever tasted in AZ Portion size is plentiful and the chips are quality I love the indie music selection it really adds to the vibe of Gallo Blanco If Im in the area I make it a point to visit
1,Rude rude rude I will never go back to this place I dont normally carry cash and when I went to pick up my sons pants for his recital that night I was in a little bit of a jam they only take cash or checks When I suggested they might put this on the claim ticket or at least mention it when people drop off their clothes the owner pointed to an itty bitty sign and told me we have signs everywhere The owner was hostile and argumentative and just didnt care about what I had to say Then he hovered over me while my son tried his pants on like I was going to steal something the place is TINY I went to an ATM and pulled out cash it wasnt that big of a deal but this place has no customer service skills whatsoever I wont ever go there again Steer clear
1,"The Vine Tavern ill omit the word Eatery as im fairly certain this term cant be applied to the food they serve at this establishment is a vortex sort of culmination hangout for lowbrow Fred Durst clones and future dayshift strippers With that being said this cesspool of a building hasnt burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening there

Being new to the Tempe area myself and a small group of friends decided to drop in to check it out  As we approached thedimly lit building I began to have second thoughts my bloomy sense was tingling more on this later As we entered we were greeted by a lovely bouncer type gentlemen who begged us to pay the 5 cover seriously We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts We ordered food

The food arrived in a timely manner it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care I ordered the mushroomswiss burger 9 dollarsish If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine I had immediate food regret my only consolation was the 1 you call its and the poor old man behind the mic with his acoustic guitar wrapping up his set Surreal   We regrettably paid and escaped out the back 

Good Cheap Drinks

5,What a joy to discover Thai Lahna with my friend Keith Galbut who has been going here for over 10 years I can see why Family owned and operated  and everyone is very friendly and helpful Of course all that matters is the food right  and its marvelous We tried several dishes and all were well spiced and wonderful Highly recommended
5,My roommate came home the other night with a Chocolate Cream pie and oh my goodness It is AMAZING The crust is this wonderful crunchy chocolately wonderfulness I think she bought a Groupon and I dont know how much she paid but the pie was so good regardless of full price Im sure its worth it
5,"The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine China Magic Noodle House however is the real deal This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA as well as noodle houses that Ive frequented in Taipei

They have a great selection of cold noodle hot noodle and soup noodle dishes And a variety of ways to have your noodles I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles Theres always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce

If youre looking for a reasonably priced ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix especially the East Valley China Magic Noodle House should be near the top if not first on your list the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isnt enough choices where chicken is the main protein"
5,Was looking for a nice dinner place in Peoria to send my mom and stepdad for a birthday celebration  The people at Flemings were wonderful  They took my request over the phone and made sure they had a lovely evening  Mom raved about the service and the photos she sent made the food look fantastic
5,great food HUGE wine list same as Kashmere  whatever you do make sure to get there cob salad thing stedson chopped salad I substituted the salmon for chicken but it is still out of this world i know people that have brought in chefs from outoftown to figure out what is in it so they can bring it home to their city dont remember much else but i remember i have never had anything bad since i have been going there
5,Very delicious food without long waits The staff is very friendly and accommodating I look forward to going back
5,"One word PISTACHIO
in all its glory
no need to say more"
5,"When I first stepped into Smeeks my entire face lit up I was figuratively and quite literally a kid in a candy store 

Its is a true one of a kind store its so entertaining to just walk around in The decor is fun the inventory is even more fun and the photo booth is by far the most fun

The walls are full of great novelty items such as the Smoking Baby that actually smokes Yodeling Pickle that actually yodels and Fake Cigarettes that are surprisingly realistic Plus Smeeks has a lot of really cool and delicious candy My personal favorite was the Fat Pig organic chocolate bar with Puntini coming in a close second 

Smeeks is most definitely my new favorite store in CenPho"
1,"Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcohol
Honestly my lunch was just okay
Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata
Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype

But I am supposed to be honest

This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch Yeah I probably wouldve been better off at the Billet Bar across the street I mean it is biker week The people watching wouldve been stellar The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio But even his piece of art body wont bring me back

The first hint shouldve really been the overpriced drinks we started with I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction A coworker got the stigmata Holy strong and not in a good way I mean I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I cant even enjoy it 

One of my other coworkers on the other hand was enjoying his blue moon That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off yes fell in one piece onto our table What happened to the contents do you ask That went all over him the table inside someones wallet and onto an iPhone and my face The waiter wasnt even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which werent soaking anything up at all No wet rag no comp no apology nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasnt bought at a prank store and a sticky table faces and sunglasses

The chicken lollipops were not what I expected but really werent bad I did enjoy those I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries Cute silver bucket Tons of fries Couldnt finish

I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it Totally forgot to order it without tomato but I picked it off easily 

I know what youre thinking they serve breakfast here til 2pm why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast Honestly none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order but Im glad I didnt after seeing a coworkers tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for 10 Also I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish Just sayin I know a bit or two about Amish goodness

So back to my lunch it was just eh which was sad The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed finally after all the mishaps Id had up until this point I do admit I loved the bread It was delicious I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard aioli or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce which was given with the sweet potato fries ew they tried to make me honey mustard Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops 

What I paid for this was ridiculous
The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous
The food was meh
Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there
It was like the beautiful model that has no brains and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience Dont try to woo me with simple sex appeal

One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again I told him maybe

Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too oy vey"
5,"This review corresponds to my first CheckIn to Oreganos 

Outside of the wait times Ive not had a bad experience  Oreganos The food was good the people were friendly and I had a good time This visit was no exception Even when my wife got meat in her minestrone soup the situation was handled impressively well Ive known for years that my wife is a VERY picky eater when dining out she left all smiles and so did I

Its one of few places I go to with stuff on the walls that I dont find obnoxious  

Keep up the good work"
5,Excellent brunch food and great Bloody Marys They make their own bread onsite which is to die for Love it Hate the valet parking
5,Chopped Salad was fabulous as was the lamb burger Service was top rate
5,"Visited this restaurant last week with a groupon special not expecting their best service since I was using a coupon I was pleasantly surprised on how great the service was  Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly which made for a great happy hour  Their guacamole is great and their assorted chip basket made everything extra yummy

Ill definitely be returning "
5,This is the most comfortable place to have a glass of wine relax and enjoy some great food Their service is amazing There are really comfy seats and couches inside and great outdoor seating You could literally spend hours here They have wifi so you can chill out on your CPU or IPad The bar super cool Very nice bartenders that are knowledgable and accommodating Their wine is killer of course or they wouldnt be named 5th and Wine right
5,"Pita Jungle can do NO WRONG in my eyes 

The food has always been amazing I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased  Also they are a home spun local business which always makes me happy 

Yes they do have hipper then thou hipster working there but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus 

I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there because I want them all Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered 

My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA Its incredibly filling split it with 2 or 4 friends seriously 

Another fav is off the starters section but its so much food that I never finish The lavosh pita crisp Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp 

Thank You Pita Jungle for bringing bomb diggity food to the valley"
1,The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste  The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen they must be off of baby chicks  I thought it was getting punked actually LOL  Never to be back
1,I have so many friends that love this chain but Im not a fan Ive eaten at different locations across different states but always end up sick I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything Ive gotten sick from salad pasta to steaks Needless to say if a friend wants to eat dinner here its tea or water only for me
5,I love the menu here it has many selections of many cultures including Italian
5,The shaved ice at Bahama Bucks reminds us of vacationing in Hawaii Lots of flavoring options and a cheap date  Havent tried the smoothies yet but we heard theyre great
5,"By far my favorite restaurant in valley Deliciously spicey A bit pricey if youre picking and choosing items but theyre complete meals are a pretty good bang for the buck 

Not actually sure about the service as Ive only gotten takeout but if its any where close to the quality of food then it must be awesome"
5,"Hands down the best breakfast Ive had in TempePhoenix   We arrived on a Sunday morning around 9am and had no wait for a table  The service was friendly and attentive  A few slip ups on forgetting things in the kitchen eg bringing someones toast but our waitress was great

Everyone in our party loved their food  I had the Vatican skillet which we still cant figure out why its called the Vatican and blueberry pancakes  Others had the three musketeers omelette and the breakfast burrito  All of the food was awesome

And then there was the brandied blackberry bread pudding dessert  Oh My God  I dont even have the words to describe it  At least not words that are appropriate for yelp  It alone is worth a trip to this restaurant

Ill be back  Not soon enough"
5,Absolutely loved this place My fiance and I came across the Arrogant Butcher while we were in Phoenix celebrating my birthday and our engagement My fiance had found it on yelp and said we must go there for lunch one day while we were there We ended up going here for my birthday dinner after a higher end establishment couldnt accomodate my gluten allergy The food the drinks and the waitstaff were great It was so good we went back the next day
5,This is one of the best Asian meals you may ever eat They are amazingly inexpensive for lunch too The house fried rice and the wonton soup are perfection The Lincoln location is prettier but the food is the same
5,"Wow love that a place like this moved in down the street 
Inexpensive fresh delicious  everything I want in a mexican restaurant
My soft shell carne asada taco was fantastic  freshly prepared and topped with guacamole which by the way is super creamy Basket of chips are free as is the toppings bar  every one of the 6 or sauces were delicious 
I plan on frequenting Salsa Blanca  "
1,This is the closest to a New York hipster style coffee shop Ive seen in Arizona  They serve beer too  Problem is that the espresso was unbelievably bitter  Cookie happy hour is pretty cool though
5,My husband and I absolutely LOVE this restaurant Anytime I find myself craving Mexican food the first place that pops in my head is Salsa Blanca We have always encountered friendly welcoming staff and amazing fulfilling food What more could you ask for
5,Best place in Arcadia to get a coffee or a tea Lots of friendly locals and great place to sit outside to people watch and read the paper in the morning early lunchtime
5,"Best Steak Ever That is all  

Everything on the menu is amazing Go now"
5,"in honor of the impending superbowl XLV i wanted to write my majerles review 

this year though instead of hitting up a sports bar for the biggest day in football ill be going to a party a real rager if i wasnt though i would definitely be pressed up against majerles front door bright and early superbowl morning its a great sports bar

the weirdest thing about majerles is their name someone finally told me it wasnt pronounced mah jer lees like i had thought its pronounced mar lees so let me get that out first

im a big sports nut well let me rephrase that im a big sports nut when it involves REAL sports i wont make fun of anyone but if its not football baseball basketball or hockey i dont wanna hear about it unless of course were talking about extreme sports like surfing skateboarding etc 

being a fan of sports makes me a fan of sports bars there are only 3 main things i need in order for a sports bar to be great in my opinion let me lay them out for you

a good selection of beers happy hour specials and bar snacks yes majerles has this in spades large selection of beers and any sports bar that has perrier jouet vueve clicquot and dom champagnes must be praisedmostly because i think this is absolutely hilarious WHO orders pricey champers at a sports bar haha also put me down as a fan of their reuben reuben and tenderloin sliders yum

the service theres nothing worse than sidling up to a bar excited to watch your team kick some ass and ordering a drink from a bartender that seems bored and unhappy every bartender ive come in contact with at majerles truly loved being at work or they at least acted like it bartenders attitudes really carry a lot more weight then they realize happy bartender   happy bar patrons

the strategic placement of large TV sets for comfortable viewing pleasure yep they designed this with real sports fans in mind no matter where i sit i can see a multitude of TVs with little blocking my view 

so they have it all and i likey go here if youre looking for a good bar to watch the superbowl or any sporting event for that matter 

oh and GO PACK GO"
1,Great at first then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 2030 minutes put everyones bill on my tab I opened a tab so this wouldnt happen then they made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what Then they over charged us by quit a bit We had to flag someone fdown from napkins and plates and it took a few trys for a water And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long There were three bartenders for what I handle myself at a bar on a daily basis No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting or deal just to close a check Kind of a joke really
5,"Excellent service I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member so I tried this place I was SO HAPPY clean pleasant warm comforting The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa The staff is friendly and efficient 
Lavenders day spa can learn from this place Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES 
I HIGHLY recommend it here Go and enjoy"
5,I live no where near this place  have gone out of my way to eat there MANY times I havent been since it moved bc I had no idea where they went but it looks like its bigger so thats great I even made it a point to take an out of town friend here I dont know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel in a good way It can get really busy at lunch so I dont recommend it for a lunch break from work I did that once and got in and out just fine but its a lot more fun without the time crunch Everything is delicious but the mini red velvet cupcake is always a must
5,"Quick update for Mama Javas since we had the Yelp Office Hours there last week we lucked out and were able to take over the couch  chairs to the right when you walk in the door  It worked out perfectly  

Even though I hadnt been in to MJ in a couple of months Jensy remembered that I drank a soy latte  incredible  I felt so special almost like a regular when I walked in and she greeted me and asked if I wanted a soy latte  I did and it was just as good as last time

The atmosphere provided the perfect place for the yelpers to come and go chat etc I think everyone felt comfortable and welcome  Thanks again to all of you who came by to visit  Looking forward to the next time 

Lastly MJ created a yelper special of the day the hold me closer tiny yelper which i believe was a vanilla cinnamon latte  Now if that didnt make us feel special what does"
1,"This dog park gets one starWhyBecause the last time I wentsome piece of shit broke into just about every car in the parking lot to steal whatever they couldSo much broken glass from side windows everywhere
It used to be okay before this incidentbut a busy parking lot in borad daylight and some vulture lies in wait
YeahIm done here"
5,Its been a while since I was in Arizona but I still remember the Olive and Ivy  I was in Phoenix on a business trip and went out for dinner at this place with a bunch of work people based on a recommendation from a local  We were not disappointed  Firstly I want to say that the decor and outdoor area in this place is just fabulous  We sat outside and enjoyed a delicious meal  The staff were professional welcoming and accommodating  I enjoyed the experience so much that I brought the gf along for dinner when she arrived that weekend  Both times I was extremely pleased with the food drink level of service and the ambience of the place  5stars for mine
5,Great little hole in the wall with authentic New Mexican food  Chili Relleno was awesome and the red and green chile was flavorful and spicy  Rice and beans were good and the sopapilla was delicious Atmosphere was cozy  If you want real red and green chile vs sauce this is the place
5,I just stopped at Biagio nail place today and got my mani and pedi done it was fabulous Tiffany gave me great feet and my neck massage She does really job The shellac manicure was really nice she gave me a lots of different colors so she actually helped me find the colors that i like and I was very happy that I got her I will Go back and ask for her
1,I just had the ice cream That was when I didnt know where to go for ice cream It tasted artificial much like how everything else looked There was also a weird feeling about the place  too selfconsciously cute  suspension of reality  almost as if a crime was imminent like a bad TV show Looking at the rest of the food was almost disturbing  like school cafeteria food only worse Oh well it discouraged me from eating anything the whole rest of the day
5,This is one of my favorite places to go in Phoenix I love the 5 wine glasses during happy hour The bruschetta is out of this world The sundae with salted caramel and pretzels is probably one of the BEST things I have ever eaten o
5,"The food in this place is indescribably awesome Granted the place could be nicer but if youre in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place this is it The service is fast friendly and the prices are great especially knowing that their portions are typically huge I cant finish my plate most of the time so I always end up taking leftovers home 
I love their Jade Red Chicken as well as their emerald chicken Their black beans are to die Order a combo plate if this is your first time here Youll get a good mix of everything and youll leave without regrets"
5,everything everyone has posted about this company is true great service friendly people good pricing highly recommend
5,I dont love the coffee at Starbucks but this place is getting 5 stars for their service They are quick ACCURATE friendly and they always remember my drink even though I only go there about once a week Amazing The staff is great and I thought I should leave them a nice little Good Job on Yelp
5,This place was incredible  The staff was friendly not pretentious and very knowledgable I dont know what it was called but our group ordered a tray which was a sampler platter and had a bit of everything on it  So fresh  We also tried the sushi with the caviar on top  Try the sake that they recommend flown in from Japan  they are the only ones in PHX that carry it  Im not a sake fan but I loved it  Thats how good it was
5,Monkey Pants has some of the best burgers in AZ  Great place for a long lazy lunch over some pitchers  I think one month my friends and I went there like 20 times for lunch  Never got sick of it  Its a dive bar but its a cool dive bar
5,We were in town for the weekend and I had a cigar at this lounge  The cigar prices are reasonable and I didnt mind paying 9 for a La Gloria Wavelle  Service was good and the atmosphere was nice and chill  My Wife doesnt smoke cigars and the air circulation was good no lingering smoke  We met some nice people and the lounge singers were a plus  We will come back next time we visit I wish we had something like this in LA
1,If you like the stuck up Scottsdale vibe this is a good place for you The food isnt impressive Nice outdoor seating
5,"Where else can you get fresh lemon grass fresh pork uterus and avocado ice cream  Asian markets are the bomb but Lee Lees is the BOMB DIGGETY since they have EVERYTHING  Jamaican Cuban Vietnamese Korean Indian Lebaneseyou name it

If you love to cook and I do I really do you can seriously spend hours here  

ONE CAVEAT  The seafood is fresher and better at 99 Ranch on 44th St in Phoenix

Last week they were giving a 10 discount off of your grocery bill and a free bottle of fish sauce or soy sauce  If you spent over a certain amount you got a big bag of rice

Go  Now

And have lunch in the Vietnamese restaurant attached"
5,"This is my FAVORITE place to dine out in the greater Phoenix area The food I recommend the steaks is almost as good as the view and the service is impeccable My boyfriend took me here on a date a year ago and it was definitely one of the most romantic restaurants we have found in Phoenix yet 

The prices are a little high 25  40 per entree but its well worth it and you wont leave disappointed If you like American or French food who doesnt and have a special occasion or just feel like doing something different I highly recommend Different Pointe of View to everyone"
5,"Dropped into this joint just wandering around Old Town Scottsdale Ordered the nachos and had a couple margs WOW The staff was friendly have a great sense of humor you gotta see the posted picture joke in person and the food isbeyond good Having only sampled the uber nacho plate which is by the way as big as a platter and slathered in layers of ooey gooey cheesy goodness I can definitively say 

Best 
Ever 

I give this place the highest marks for doesnt suck"
5,"If you ever want to instantly up your cool factor with a friend or date meet them at the Lost Leaf The mere fact that there is no external sign other than the tacky open sign indicating that it is indeed the lost leaf you would probably never have any idea that the best neighborhood bar in Phoenix is inside When i am asked to describe the lost leaf to someone who has never been before it is basically a big open house with the most wellstocked beer fridge you have ever seen

No cocktails or draft but for atmosphere and quality of beer selection lost leaf is by far my favorite place to meet people in dtown phoenix"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area There I wrote itand I am sticking to it First off  fresh local sustainable organic are not just words on the menu and the website Now in places like San Francisco and NYC this would be nothing notable but in the desert it is truly something hard to find Aside from the practical in the land of Fox Restaurants True aside and the big box store at the strip mall there really appears to be little demand for a small local restaurant on a farm Its time to make new demands Its time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighborbut I digress 

We enjoyed the Farmers Feast and it was worth every penny of the 65person First the house cured meats including the head cheese were amazing Second how often do you get a chefs menu where each persons plate is different Not often Ultimately we each tried 10 different items And each item was amazing I would come back for the pasta alone let along the perfectly cooked scallops and melt in your mouth sliced fillet 

The service was ideal If you want to eat in 60 minutes dont come here but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food do come here I noted to the waiter that the previous night they had sturgeon  something I havent seen on a menu since N California I commented on how unique it is etcOf course it was not available on the night I was thereor was it When it came to our fish course the waiter brought out sturgeon for me The restaurant didnt have enough to have it on the menu but the waiter clearly put in a special request on my behalf and made the effort to make a diner happy 

Maybe if I offer to work on the farm I can eat for free"
5,"Matts was absolutely fantastic Got there at 2pm on a Sunday which is apparently the time to do it half an hour before close as we walked right in sat right down and had food in 5 minutes or less Brilliant

I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had Two eggs two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon american cheese my favorite with eggs when Im not going fancystyle reminds me of when I was a kid and well grilled onions round it out served on a fantastic roll 

By default this item doesnt include the normal potatoes and toast so I had them add homefriesthey were magnificent and entirely unnecessary A huge portion of them with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up they were delicious but I couldnt finish them

The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal Matts brings the good stuff and its MUCH appreciated Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike The waffle was fluffy light and had that good homemade flavor

I cant get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was Service was prompt and friendly and overall it was a great experience Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about 21 Absolutely worth every penny Will be coming back Probably near 2 oclock again to avoid the wait"
5,"This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around  Not to mention their mashed potatoes salad and biscuit  Ive never been able to clean my plate here which is great since I always have an extra meal   Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller but then you dont have the extra goodies for later  

Its a small down home place dress comfy and go there to eat up  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff  

Ive had their TBone here and its good but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous  Wonderful food

Prices for lunch are around 700 and dinner around 1200  really hard to beat for real down home cooking"
5,I love the place  Was a bit hesitant at first but friends recommended it and it turned out to be quite good  They even have a few choices for those that arent into Asian fare
5,I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location  And I raved about it and vowed to come back although the strange location in a salon delayed that return  Then Crudo disappeared  And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies  Now it has reappeared and in a better location  Oh joy
5,"BEST RESTAURANT IN AZ 

No but seriously I could eat every meal here Chef Becky is amazing and breakfast this morning did not disappoint I decided to try the Organic Oatmeal and my friend ordered the Red Velvet pancakes Ok so youre probably saying with all that yummy goodness you ordered oatmeal Well what I really wanted were the chilequiles eggs cotija jack pulled pork tortillas tomatillo verde Yes please but being allergic to eggs I went with the oatmeal which was delicious The oatmeal had a vanilla flavor to it and the strawberry and pecan topping gave it some texture The red velvet pancakes are too intense for words Rich fluffytheyll make you want to get up early on a Saturday morning I also tried a side order of the banana bread which was slightly toastednow if youve never toasted banana bread you need to This was the perfect buttery flavor combination with the oatmeal  

The service was fast as alwayswe never had to wait or ask for a coffeewater refill The decor inside is warm but I think sitting outside on the patio is the way to go 

Love the Herb Box and cant wait to go back and try the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes"
5,This review can be applied to any and all Quick Trip locations  I have on many occasions gone out of my way to stop in QT over other gas stations because not only are they much much nicer but they are very clean and offer a ton of gas station fare drinks shakes coffees juices snacks etc  I really appreciate how quickly they work with cashiers that are able to take care of two customers at once  I usually abhor using gas station bathrooms because lets face it weve all been there and seen how putrid they can be but whenever I visit QT they are always clean They mop sweep clean the bathrooms windex the doorsand for that I applaud you all thanks for the cleanlinessD
5,What a place  I recently hosted a 25person family party there and both the food and service were impeccable  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating even with the dozen children we had in the group  Leslie was the manager and she paid attention to every last detail helping me to plan the menu and gauge food quantities for that many people  The restaurant itself was spotless from the outside patio down to the restrooms  Thanks for making our family event such a wonderful success  Everyone left full and happy  We will definitely be back
5,"Oh my God Chompies is the bomb and Im so happy to have a location so close to my house

While this location has a steady customer base I have never had to wait longer then five minutes to be seated unlike the other location at 92nd Street Win Service has always been fantastic Quick on to seat quick to get drinks quick on refills and delicious food from breakfast to dinner items As other reviewers have stated the Jewish sliders are amazing but I have also enjoyed different wraps and sandwiches Prices are a little higher but the food is well worth the money There is a bar area with about six stools and two TVs that you are able to see from your tablesbooths which usually has ESPN on 

The restaurant itself is all decked out in a NYC theme well lit but the acoustics arent that great so it can get a little noisy Bathrooms are nice and always clean Oh and dont forget to check out their bakery for delicious goodies to take home"
5,Great sushi place  Ample portions of sashimi  Unagi is the best Ive had  And dont forget the Tako salad  The atmosphere is okay  Its not bad but not exactly cool  Of course if it were 4 miles south in Old Town Scottsdale youd never get a table
5,"Careful Youll get addicted

Angel Sweet is the best gelato this side of Italy

The pana cotta and zupa flavors are to die for Dont settle for just one either you can get as many flavors as will fit in your cup"
5,"I cant believe I hadnt been here before yesterday  Talk about a hidden gem  I was taking a friend around to cross stuff off her List of Stuff to do Before the World Ends and smoking a hookah happened to be on it  Therefore I googled places nearby us and Oasis popped up

As soon as we got there the guy at the door welcomed us in with a smile and opened the door for us and once inside the waitressbartender helped us pick a table and took our drink orders  We decided to get the peach hookah and an order of the Hummus and Pita Deluxe with beef  The food was delicious and the hookah was great  The staff was awesome the entire night as well  Everyone kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and they would just stop and chat with us as well  One guy was even helping my friend try to make smoke circles  I definitely love that theyre open until 4 am on Fridays and Saturdays too because its always nice to have somewhere to wind down after all the bars close"
1,This Jack in the Box location has the worst service  food that I have found in the Phoenix metro area Every time I have gone through the drive through there my order has either been wrong or inedible  how hard is it to make a taco without frying it into oblivion The wait times are consistently more than 5 minutesI think I will be spending that 5 minutes driving to another location just to get the correct order  food that is properly prepared
5,"My meal at FnB last weekend was one of the best Ive had in Arizona I love everything about this place the food the cocktails the staff the atmosphere

It was a rainy Sunday I knew the restaurant was right next to Cowboy Ciao but managed to walk right by it my friends noticed me go by I turned back and Pavle was nice enough to wait at the door and said Ben as I was about to pass by again I agree with what everyone else said here Pavle really makes you feel at home

I started with the slivered fennel salad and a ginhound I split the order with a friend and they were more than happy to bring the salad split  onto two plates for us I love citrus and these were a very refreshing start to my meal 

Next up was the trout It was presented stacked on top of the sunchokes and caramelized onions with some wonderful broth on the plate The combination of flavors was rich and amazing and the presentation ensured that every bite was as good as the last I could eat this every visit but I sampled the chicken and lamb and was just as blown away For desert I had lemon cake with ice cream and strawberry compote 

FnB has been receiving a lot of positive buzz lately Its well deserved If you havent visited yet youre missing out"
1,Got a padi and the tech stopped for a while to eat then i got a new tech to finish my pedi my total was different than the quoted price when paying my total was 25 i hanede them a 50 and they cashier tried to keep all the change for a tip he refused to give me my change until i told him that is not gon to happen My feet were so dry afterwards I DO NOT recommend them
5,"So my coworkers and I decide we want donuts on a Weds I know typically donuts are on Fridays but what the hay In my search for a really good donut I go to the Internet and Google best donuts and low and behold Bosa Donuts comes up They have 3 locations and the one in Chandler has 12 reviews which all raved about how great Bosa Donuts were So I notice they have a location at 35th Ave and Glendale I had seen it many times but never stopped in thinking it was just the average run of the mill donut shop Boy was I wrong 
Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time maybe ever I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops I wont mention any names you know who you are Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too If you have not tried Bosa Donuts in Phoenix you are missing out"
5,Papago has a great beer selection  awesome food Try the Orange Blossom
5,"YUM

I can never remember what it is but order the salad thing on pita bread  It will change your life  My coworkers and I would always go in here and share one of those and then wed each get a slice of pizza  Perfect amount of food low prices never toodisgustingly full  Their bilinis are wonderful as well"
5,Best Italian restaurant in the valley as far as Im concerned Totally unassuming from the outside since its in a strip center on 64th St  Greenway in the same center as Frys and McDonalds But this family run restaurant that has been here for years Same friendly staff every timeespecially love being in the bar area A little on the pricey side but definitely worth it Must try the ravioli either as an appetizer or main dish and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side All entrees come with soup or salad
5,Yelpers  have a question If menus and prices vary by location help this CA transplant figure out the best ones to try Thanks Ive heard such good things about Sonic but have only been to the Anaheim and Hemet CA ones while visiting
5,May I add family friendly to my past reviews We love this place because we feel like we are home when we come here The staff is kind and they always welcome us with open arms The manager Kaj literally treats us like family We brought our new born baby to Corbins for her first meal out and we were thrilled with the level of service we received as usual The food is excellent and the service is divine The happy hour is awesome My favorite items are the quesedillas burgers feta and hot sauced topped homemade potato chip appetizer and the excellent selection of beers Corbins is just an overall  great place
5,I was extremely happy that we chose Cool Cuts 4 Kids for my sons first big boy hair cut He was instantly comfortable and drawn in by all of the friendly things they have for children He was given the choice of a movie or playing a video game of course knowing exactly what he wants went straight for the video game Sonic on XBOX It was pretty much a breeze from that point the little guy was hypnotized and didnt even realize what was going on w his beautiful lovely long hair  obviously they need to focus on distracting the moms lol Jessie who cut my sons long hair was a doll she didnt seem to be bothered by the mother breathing down her neck as she hacked off my littles hair or the boyfriend taking a copious amount of pictures and video of the whole event In the end my son looked great and I was a happy mama I couldnt have asked for a better experience
5,"Amanda at Butterfly Petals did the flowers for my wedding I didnt want to spend  a lot on them and shaved it down to only needing my bouquet three boutonnieres and two corsages I told her what I liked and didnt and my budget She created a bunch of options for me based on my specifics so I had a  number of choices She also did all of this via email which I give her total kudos for 

On the day of my wedding there was a fabulous bouquet waiting for me as well as perfect corsages and boutonnieres for my groom and our parents Amanda waited for me even though I was terribly late to make sure I was happy with her creations which really gave a personal touch

Butterfly Petals is creative and affordable I love my bouquet so much that I ended up keeping it and I am having it preserved"
5,I loved this casual dining experience at the gorgeous Phoenician  I stopped in for happy hour with some friends and we had a great time  We sat in front of the fireplace and sipped beers over appetizers  The location alone is worth going for but the food was good and service was even better
1,"I purchased a pair of Naot Paris sandals 160 with tax at The Shoe Mill  I considered buying online but decided to shop locally instead  I ended up paying more but assumed that I was paying for the superior service  I wore my new shoes to work on Friday  By the end of the day I had developed blisters on both feet near my toes and my ankles  I was surprised because I had read many reviews stating how comfortable Naot sandals are and the salesman who helped me confirmed that I was buying the correct size  Sadly I took them back to the store the next day  To my surprise I was told that The Shoe Mill does not take returns  I have never tried to return shoes so it didnt occur to me to ask this question when I made the purchase  However as I stated I expected full service from a high end shoe store
I will no longer shop at The Shoe Mill  Its been three days and my feet are still recovering  Its a constant reminder of how dissatisfied I was with my purchase  I will definitely shop Zappos next time"
5,This place has the best wraps Ive ever had  The smoothies are good as well but I go here because of the wraps
5,I stopped by a Friday morning a few months past and have been meaning to write a review Ive had donuts since then from other donut shops but none compare to Bosa The price and quality at Bosa are far superior to all others You cant go wrong with the donut holes
5,Amazing place wish i lived in Phx so i could have this EVERYDAY
5,One of my favorite places to eat if Im looking for cheap and fast 
5,"I love this place Just to hang out on a Summer day on the patio and have a beer is likethe perfect day 

The food is awesome The Kilt Lifter is tasty and thirst quenching 

The area is definitely lucky to have such a place"
1,"Once again THE TROUGH SLURPERS offer far too many stars to this mundane eatery proving again that they are truly CANAILLE of the first order
Slow indifferent service
Mediocre food
The kind of wine that patrons of kokopelli swill with delight calling it ambrosia when its actually dishwater
Butas with Kokopelli it keeps the shit eaters out of the better restaurants So I say to you canailleflock flock there with your disruptive screaming children and your leathery palates"
5,Yes I love Eegees I have to admit it could be a bit of a problem for me as I drove from Chandler to Casa Grande just for an eegee and sammich in the worse rush hour traffic If that isnt love I dont know what is because we all know Arizona drivers are  well you know I always get the pina colda mixed with lemon eegee and a grinder  or turkey sub and dont forget the ranch fries The one is Casa Grande is new and clean not that I can say the same for the ones in Tucson
1,I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour  The volcano chicken was my favorite meal  However the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water  I took a sip squeezed the lemon and thought there was something wrong with the taste  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no sure enough it was a cricket in which i took a picture  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying It happens  No sorry thats disgusting  If i hadnt been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water theres no discount or compensation off of my bill
1,I went here with Friends last Friday  All my friends and I use Yelp at the end of the meal taking cost into perspective we all came to this is a 1 star place  It was a huge disappointment after looking at the positive reviews  Our 1st disappointment came because they had a limited beer list  My good buddy just wanted an IPA and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones  Then the Spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible  We had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry  The Calamari was extremely oily  The only positive thing was the lamb chops but once you factor in price that was poor too  We all came to the conclusion we would never go back
5,Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale The food is delicious and is not prepackaged such a nice change for a coffee joint Support local business Starbucks has nothing on Lux other than a million locations
5,"The management thanked me profusely for my input on Yelp and graciously invited me to return as a guest to show me the true Latilla Experience I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP reviewThe changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine

I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were

Beet salad it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad  pop with flavor 

Foraged mushroom rissottocorrectally made with a depth of flavor it was good on its own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg 

Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good 

We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach

Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jamfigs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together

The service we had was phenomenal

The food at Latilla is masterfully done the surroundings are majestic and breathtaking The meal we had wasnt ordinary it was extraordinary"
5,5 stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink but thats why I love this place That and its near the Trunk Space
5,"Lux is a great place for coffee bakery items bites and even cocktails if the occasion permits The people are friendly and it has a great atmosphere

I love coming here in the afternoon for a cup of their Americano which is pretty damn topnotch As I dont live in AZ if Im going to be away for an extended period of time Im always sure to take a bag of their freshlyroasted coffee beans from wherever with me

I was there last week on a Sunday afternoon having some darn good mimosas with a friend and it wasnt too crowded

The only downside Ive experienced is it can be a bit confusing where to order for food and cocktails during the day

If you go for the first time dont be shy Grab a cup of coffee and explore As one of the earlier reviewers mentioned you might get looks walking in like you shouldnt be there Maybe its your hair Maybe youre displaying something thats not ecofriendly Whatever dude Be brave press on Its worth it"
5,I was in the middle of a dilemma and needed proof of something faxed to me right away and stopped in here and got what i needed within just five minutes and was outta there and back to what i needed to take care of  The price for two piece of paper for the fax was almost 3 which while is not the cheapest considering you can get it for free at home but beggars cannot be choosers and was happy to pay it
5,"My mom had purchased a Groupon for this place back in March and yesterday we were all deciding what sounded good for lunch I suggested Mexican so then we were thinking which Mexican restaurant sounded good Living in AZ you know theres MANY to choose from So my mom suggested going to Blue Adobe so all of us headed there 

My mom my dad my sister my nephew and I all thoroughly enjoyed our meals I had the Triple Stack of New Mexican style Enchiladas One shredded beef and two Carne Adovada It was SO delicious The red sauce at Blue Adobe is unparalleled and unlike any other My dad had the Chorizo stuffed Chicken Breast and loved it My mom had the seafood enchiladas with halibut salmon and shrimp and she inhaled those And my sister had the Chile Rellenos and couldnt stop saying how tasty they were And my 5 year old nephew loved his kids cheese enchilada Our server was named Travis and he was great as well Phenomenal service Even if Travis had been subpar I would still give this place 5 Stars because thats just how good the food is"
5,"This place is excellent  Hands down the best tacos Ive had  Fresh and flavorful meats and great salsas  I see people raving about some of the salsa bars at all of the bertos and such but the salsa there is like water compared to what Tacos Atoyac has to offer  They care about what they are serving and take pride in their craft

If you like the style of food here you must try Sonora Mesquite Grill on 46th Street and Thomas"
5,"I totally love this place It reminds me of the old school hardcore Chinese restaurant my parents used to take us when we were kids D 

The decor is amazing unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix The walls are a teal blue adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China golden dragons and more The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate The place looks like its from a bygone era doesnt help that its in a run down strip mall but it is clean and charming inside

The service was great kind to our 2 yo and very attentive The food was the best part I cant remember the last time I had such good Chinese food and its priced very reasonably We got the Peking dinner for 2 which included the fried noodles hot tea wonton soup with generous noodles meat shrimp and veggies the best Ive ever had a pupu platter with eggrolls bbq skewers house wings and those cheese puff thingies the presentation is pretty cool too Next came 3 entree sized plates of food mongolian beef fried chicken cant remember the name and the Peking fried rice The meal concluded with incredible little desserts sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey I could have eaten 100 of them Adding in a beverage and tax the meal was only 34 

My 2 yo can really eat so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for 2 people with him the 3 of us walked out with lots of leftovers Highly recommended Do it DO IT"
1,"OVERPRICED  DECEITFUL  RUDE

I should have read the reviews before I came here I took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 14 inch not much I asked her how much will this cost She assured me it would not be much It was 60 and she hardly did a thing cant even steam it there I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO She said its because the dress cost more Yeahlike that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work she charge him 1850 for each pair I dont know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off

Previously Ive been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me 50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it Theyre also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive"
5,"Great prices and service The delivery process could be improved but for the price and peace of mind with the Costco warranty process you cant go wrong 

High quality furniture and very low prices"
5,I have been going here for years  The staff is always very pleasant the place is nice and clean and they offer a variety of services  I also like the 5 kids haircuts on certain days  Overall a top notch establishment
5,I have been going to Salon Mila for 12 years  I will never go anywhere else  My hair always looks amazing when I leave  The color and cut are always perfect  I feel glamorous and beautiful when I leave  First class salon  Beautiful surroundings  Always great service  They aim to please  Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time  Thanks everyone
1,"Buca Di Beppo is literally italian restaurant hell You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage Buca Di Beppo throws junk and knick knacks and statues and anything else italian they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods Its a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta


Its embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here Thin flavorless alfredo sauce Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix I went with a large group and across the table bland food

When they seat your party they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello Deep down you know they hate this Why are we in the kitchen Sure its nice but Id rather have them concentrating on making the food and making it good Of course the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good Its just dead Dead food No life no flavor not emotion I get more flavor from the 99 Michelinas frozen lunch package

Far from claiming anything authentic Italian Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility No salt no sugar no butter no fat its all gone along with anything resembling taste Sure Buca has huge portions and the setup is nice for large parties and families  but they might as well just buy the familysize pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home even that would be better and they wouldnt have to the mandatory gratuity Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden  at least their food taste like something"
5,Just did take out  Great experience  Easy to place my order over the phone friendly service  Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance  Made it an in and out operation  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN  I highly recommend it
5,"As a previous reviewer stated  This restaurant is like no other  We had a birthday celebration and we couldnt have chosen a better place to eat  

First of all the service is second to none  Every staff member that we encountered was very professional and happy to explain the food and answer any questions we had  They obviously like working there because they were all so upbeat and smiley  You feel welcome as soon as you step in the door

Now for the food  fantastic  I ordered the four course tasting menu and everything was superb  My husband ordered the ribeye steak and enjoyed every mouthful although the portion was a bit on the small side  But in between each course came a little treat of creativity from the chef so thats something weve never encountered before  For example we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more  They also served us a little savory doughnut about the size of a dollar coin that was ohsogood as well as little cranberry shooters that had little teenie squares of jello not really jello of course but a fruit gel of some sort  Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate  As the meal drew to an end they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top  For dessert I ordered the goats milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all  Fantastic

We didnt consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters 10each that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them  The total was 169 including the coasters but not including the tip so it wasnt an inexpensive night but it was well worth it  I cant wait until the next birthday celebration"
1,"I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there arent many other options around here but this is probably the worst restaurantbar Ive ever had the misfortune of going to 

My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer despite the bar being nearly empty as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers  

I drink my beer and want another  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another  The dude is just ignoring me at this point  I guess they dont want my business and I just leave  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip I just want out of here  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me  I hope he spends it well

On other trips here my wife and I have had the food  Its not any better than the service sadly  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and Im not sure he would even find this food acceptable  Overall just the worst restaurant around and its no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front  Nobodys there because its simply horrible  Avoid at all cost  I wouldnt eat here again but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house  Looking at other reviews on here I see Im not alone in my feelings about the service  Get rid of these people already just sad"
5,Been here a few times and the food is always fresh and tasty  I am Chinese from northern China   This is authentic northern Chinese cuisine  Food is not fancy but extremely delicious and satisfying  Highly recommend the Zha Jiang noodles meat sauce with hand made noodles the chives and egg pocket and dumplings  Good prices and comforting home made Chinese food  Owners are very nice
5,Much more organized than the last time I was there and I noticed more price systems vs having to ask The even had the new Color Club halo hues I have been hunting for They had 5 of the 6 colors and they were the highest priced polished in the store at 650 a pop Still MUCH cheaper that the 11 everywhere else No striping tape Although the owner did say he had ordered it before and it didnt sell well I just went down the street and got some yay candy cane nails
5,"Stopped by here for lunch today I saw the Burger sign outside and thought I would try it out WOW This place is amazing The ownerchef was taking the orders and was super helpful and friendly I had a Paradise CHZ which came with 2 patties smoked mozzarella lettuce tomato caramelized onion as well as cucumber I also ordered  Sweet Potato Tater Tots I was blown away BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX  Our bill came to 18 for 2 cheese burgers 2 sides and a soda 
It was so amazing I went back for dinner I bragged to much when I got home that my boyfriend just had to try it I had the special which was a Roasted Duck Burger 2 beef patties topped with roasted duck caramelized onions bacon fried egg over easy served with duck au jus By far the best burger of my life My boyfriend got the Beach House 2 beef patties roasted green chili smoked mozzarella pico de gallo and jalapeno ranch He also ordered the seasoned fries I dont care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good His was so good he ordered another burger 
For Desert we shared a Maple Pecan Bacon Milkshake also to die for I really think I need one of these every night
From the atmosphere the music the staff to the food every thing about PV Burgers was a hit
This is a must go"
5,"This is place is a weekly trip for us as my girlfriend loves the salmon and martinis they serve here We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here

Service 55 Fast and very helpful Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees

Ambiance 45 The place used to be a home so its a little cramped but nice nonetheless Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it As it is small
in seating ranges you cant get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales

Drinks Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black  blue martinis

recommended Food
Fish 55 My girls favorites are the halibutswordfishmiso salmon with basmati rice she also loves the spinach and asparagus
Sandwiches 55 for roast chicken with green chili side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 45 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss
meatloaf 55 best I have ever had it is a beauty
Tacos 45 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted the next time they were ok then the last time they were great not sure why but still recommended
Cream cheese cake 55 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few
Steakchicken pork 35 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isnt a wow factor like the meatloaf The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example
Appetizers  I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but havent tried the rest I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fezs awesome versions


Pricing is on par with Sophies but less than Christophers and more that Ticoz I am fine with it as the food I order is totally worth it"
1,Dscusting
5,I LOVE THIS PLACE  I have tried several of their subs and although they are all delicious the Chipolte Cheese Steak its the  43 is my favorite  It is the MOST DELICIOUS sub I have ever had  The bread is always soft and fresh it is extremely filling because its stuffed full of steak peppers and cheese  To make it absolutely the BEST sub ever have them add some of the little red chilis to it I think they call it chili relishOMG
1,"Walk the other way just walk right the hell the other way

Here was how this played out  Oktoberfest a few days ago  Starting the night off  I walk past this place and see a place that sells a slice of pizza for 199  Good right  No  

me Hi one slice of pizza please
guy you buy drink with it 4 dollars
me no just one slice of pizza
guy we do not sell one slice you have to buy a drink  4 dollars

I should have pulled a flag on this play at this point but knowing I was going to be drinking I move forward wanting food in me Not a wise move

me so I cant buy one slice
guy no you buy a drink with slice 4 dollars
me It doesnt say that anywhere on the menu or walls
guy No do not sell one slice
me what the OK give me 2 slices of pizza
guy you buy two slices then
me yes Jesus Christ yes
guy toppings
me no no toppings  cheese
guy we have toppings

what is this guy fucking deaf 

me no thanks

I give him the money

guy it take 10 minutes you wait

I dont think they run the air conditioner in this place so I wait outside

Pizza comes out  Tastes like absolute crap  I eat it outside because in September in Chandler Arizona it is cooler outside then inside this place  I think they had the thermostat set to HELL Guy working or running the place comes outside and stares me down as I am eating  Im sure if you want to eat here you can check the dumpster for plenty of slices to try beforehand to avoid having to pay for one  Excuse me avoid having to pay for two  However after what I had served to me Im pretty sure they will beat you to the garbage cans and sell it back to some other unsuspecting soul  I was the only one dumb enough to finish all the food  Wouldnt eat here if there was a natural disaster and this place was the last to be ransacked for provisions  Id keep walking

FAIL"
1,I love how all other Yelpers reviewing this company have discovered the same issues that would never permit me to use their services again Company is a disaster and should be reported to the BBB
1,if you like terrible service and overpriced food youve come to the right place  If I knew before I went in there I would be paying 1600 for macaroni and cheese and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it while my glass remained empty I wouldve stayed away which is what you should do  Food wasnt awful although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a Rock bread on their sandwiches The mac n cheese was nothing special  The service was beyond poor  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe
5,Great food Great ambiance Great for a night date on the patio I cant wait to go again
5,"You know that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Jeff Spicoli takes one of his Vans off and hits himself on his head Well thats what I did when I went to this place for the first time   Why havent I been coming here for the last 10 years this place is great  

I would say this is the best nonPizzeria BiancoCibo pizza in the valley  The crust is awesome sauce and cheese just perfect

The really impressive part is is how picture perfect the pizzas are made

The lobster ravioli were huge easily enough for two  Baked Raviolis were better that average but needed more basil or something

You really cant dine here so its take out or delivery  They have one table and a few other seats inside if you had to eat here I guess you could"
5,"Jeremiah is great He is very friendly patient and knows what hes doing 

We started off with the Drunken Cheesy Bread its ok Not something I would want again Nothing wrong with it just not my taste 

For lunch I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich along with a house salad The sandwich is great Loved it 
The house salad I mean I could not stop eating it I have no idea which kind of dressing was on it but it was AMAZING I am craving it just thinking about it 

The interior is very clean roomy very casual I heard they have great happy hour so I will be back again"
1,Mediocre bland low quality food topped off with painfully slow service  I worked in the neighborhood and continued to return occasionally just in case its gotten better for reasons I could never fathom once the plate of abysmal food was placed on the table  The salsa and rice are usually good but thats the most I have to offer
5,"I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning and I was told they now carry Coca Lite  So much better than Diet Coke  I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US  How great is that

Also Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries not too shabby huh"
5,I recently saw a Coyotes game here and I was seriously impressed This arena is super nice almost malllike and clean on the inside What also impressed me was how much stuff there is around the arena Where Im from youd have to drive somewhere else if you want to go to dinner before or hang out after the game Here you can just stay in your cozy little free parking spot and hang around Probably my only gripe is that the screens on the inside could be a little bigger but other than that this arena is right up there
5,What a place for brunch 4 drinks are fantastic Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles
5,Fast service Great burgers and fries So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite
5,Island Terrayki is a great place to eat at  The owners are nice the prices are right you cant go wrong with that  My coworkers and I have been going there for a few years now and we all love it  Highly suggest eating here if you are in the northwest valley and want some good quality food
5,"Whitney walked into Renegade Canteen and never had a chance Nor did any of her previous favorite Scottsdale spots 

The green chile pork stew is enough to make a good date great or a bad date totally tolerable Tender juicy sent from abovehaving this dish once is not enough You wont have the heart to inform your mother that after tasting McGraths bowl of deliciousness any pork dish shes ever prepared seems dry and flavorless 

We can only hope that the clouds in heaven are made of the mashed potatoes I get them every time The filet was the best steak Ive ever had Ive thought about it trust me and the Dr Pepper braised short rib will give you something else to think about the next time the Kiss Dr Love commercial comes on 

yummmmmmers"
5,"This is a Mom  Pop Mexican restaurant on Tempes east end the food is awesome
and of the good Homemade quality Known the family for almost 30 yrs now"
5,ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS RESTAURANT Amazing location and such a great food  Been going there for a long long time I have yet be even slightly annoyed BLISS They wait on you hand and foot food presentation and TASTE is FantasticAlways make you feel very special the hostesses are not rude nor snooty and are always smiling GREAT Managers LOVE them all around  and I AM SUPER PICKY  and Proud of it DO IT GO THERE 1 rest per me in AZ for beautiful location and food
5,"Had a family style meal and everything was delicious  Rigatoni in a cream sauce with chicken was outstanding as was the pound cake dessert  Appetizer stuffed mushrooms were also really good

On the pricey side but nice for a special occasion"
1,Prices are often way too high
5,Simply an AWESOME tuna sandwich Great service and the atmosphere was really cool Just wondering what the difference is between pickles and cucumbers in brine 50 cents apparently
1,I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location  She had a bag full of goodies several hundreds of dollars worth from HM  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes  Her HM bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her armsand while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted They did not call security or the police or even offer any condolences  They just shrugged their shoulders  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21but the store was such a mess  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack  There were way too few staff members working and many who were working were socializing with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion The only employees that were on task were  1 at the checkout and 1 at the fitting rooms  there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos including someone stealing bags from other customers So  if you choose to shop at this store  hold on to your bags 
5,"Recently was invited to this restaurant  found out that they have childrens plates for adults or any age

It was SUPER CHEAP  it included a drink with refills like tea or soda etc

What a deal

Under 5 bucks including the drink

I will definitely  be going back  to any Cracker Barrel who has this deal because it is cheaper than fast food etc or just about anywhere"
5,Oreganos is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe The food is delicious  Ive never been disappointed by a single appetizer entrée or desert And since theyve recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day Bonus The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly Just a really great place to dine
5,I love this place Every time I visit I come here I did miss out of Bucket of Crab night 
5,Talk about one of the best burgers in townin fact i think houstons and this place have the best burgers in phoenix I took one bite and i was in heavenit was a whole new take on a burger but not too crazy I love the fries especially when you mix the sweet potato fries with the regular ones OMG  I like to dip them in ranch but you can select what you want todip them ini have to thankmy sister for this place she introduced me Its a great place togo for lunch and dinner but itis not very big so you may have to wait but its worth it Its a fun place do not miss it
5,Dr Brodkin is one of the greatest doctor out there  She was voted two years in a row for arizona foothill top doctor and it shows  She is caring and overall great doctor  She moved her office last year and wow did she change for the best  The staff is great her new nurses i love love lovei recommend Dr Brodkin to anyone who need  a GYN
5,After shopping all over town and visiting every single shop in the phx area I stumbled into this little gem   Store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority but I am sure could be ordered if needed    This planning I found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since I dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk there just isnt any here Only quality sought after items  Management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated   When you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even  This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen   There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available    After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered   Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in   If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly knowledgeable and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place   Thanks again Reef Monsters for the help in sorting out what was an overwhelming amount of information into a custom tailoring to what I could handle and needed to continue in this hobby
5,"I absolutely love Chompies Its the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix They have a very large and extensive menu and everything Ive ordered has been really good

They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies red velvet cake enormous éclairs napoleons and New York style cheese cake

Id say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs Food The sliders were really good unlike any slider I have ever had The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor very tasty I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well 

Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses

Chompies is the best"
5,"This is  the best Asian restaurant in town Previously Shanghai Palace this out of the way restaurant serves up some of the best curry and pad Thai that I have ever tasted in my life The Panang Curry is so savory and aromatic literally one of the best things I have ever had I honestly crave this dish about twice a week
Also any thing on the menu can be made vegetarian this is a huge bonus for all veggies around town
 The Chefowner Tottie Kaya is always very hospitable She walks around to each table making sure everything is up to standard I have never once had a bad experience at this delicious eatery So if you love Asian cuisine you must dine at Totties"
5,Best pizza Ive had anywhere  Perfect perfect and I mean perfect crust  Thin chewy smoky and sweet  Lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh local produce  I deeply envy the regulars here
5,I have been going to the Matador since I was little when it was a little hole in the wall on 2nd Street  They have always had great Sonoran style Mexican food  Its always our go to place when we attend events downtown or have business to attend to They also have the best hot sauce in town  As far as the service  the food comes out quickly and we never really have to wait long  If youre downtown and looking for great food I would highly recommend this place
5,What an awesome neighborhood bar I brought my little brother here when he was in town and the service was spectacular For entertainment they have pool darts games and music Our waitress Chris was more than attentive I will defiantly be coming back
5,"unless you hate ice cream and friendly people you will love Papa Eds Its tucked away in Caitlin Court in downtown Glendale  Walking towards the front you cant help but notice all the love and care that went into the garden and flowers  the flower bed still makes me smile  Walking through the front door its easy to forget where and when you are  the wood floors Vintage coke machine and friendly staff all most made me forget why I was there ICE CREAM good selection and great ice cream 

Now lets talk about ice cream pie Papa Eds makes to order with advance notice ice cream pies I love the Peanut butter cup with Oreo cookie crust The lemon and Raspberry sorbet swirl in a  graham cracker crust and my Holiday Favorite  Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream in a graham cracker crust"
5,"I have been shopping at Lee Lees for over ten years  The store stocks Chinese Malaysian Korean Japanese West Indian and other foods  You can usually find what you are looking for here  

The fish selection is vast fresh and reasonably priced  

They have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea

Enjoy"
5,"Yknow rarely do I buy the extended warranty that most places try to peddle on you nowadays If you buy the item from a reputable manufacturer it should be unnecessary 

In the case of tires I have to make an exception 

You can control the quality of tires you buy and put on your car but not the quality of construction workers who dont know how to secure their nails screws and bolts for travel on highways streets and other local thoroughfares Theyre a nefarious bunch for the most part Im not for extra taxes but Im contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we driveand stiff penaltiesmassive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway 

For the second time in a year one of my tires caught one of the little buggers  this last one was not a nail or screw mind you but a BOLT  I pulled my receipts from the glove compartment used Yelp to find the nearest Discount Tire and called for a tow 

The replacement certificates I got were 16 per tire back in NC but theyre good here too and worth every penny The folks at this Discount Tire location were extremely nice and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes with no appointment There is even free water for customers They were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it which is fine as long as it holds 

Every Discount Tire location Ive visited has been great as far as the transparency of what youre getting the quality of customer service and the wait In a town of 43 million people and neverending road construction I have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires no matter where you buy them I prefer getting mine from DT"
5,Best whole in the wall Chinese food in the west valley I have been going here as a kid and I would go there again and again Take out is great and I would recommend getting take out there Now eating there I might not suggest taking the food home is awesome
5,Beautiful hotel great rooms best views out of the resorts in the immediate area  Service is comparable to a Ritz Carlton  Very understated and clean feeling yet still over the top luxurious
5,"Im in puppy love with the new Wag NWash in Scottsdale

Id been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home and my wish was granted this new location is less than a mile from where I live

Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a selfserve bath  I initially called to see if a groomer was in but they were booked out for weeks  Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper but it was fun and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well  Sara helped us out and explained our options  We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner brushes towels cologne etc It was easy and quick  bonus Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so

Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection homemade treats ecofriendly collars and leashes etc

Ill definitely head back to Wag N Wash again really soon so psyched that they moved to my hood"
5,Great food great Sangria great live music great vibe great service EXCLAMATION MARK Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon
5,Amazing Romantic
5,"Absolute greatness

Service friendly

Food TRY the faux chicken wings I crave this
Kung pao noodles
Vegan chilli fries

Ambiance  A

Tip dont order the faux chicken wings Togo Soggy experience plus they add the carrots cucumber celery in the box and close it Equals the case of raw cooked veggies 

Go next door to nami for dessert"
5,"Tried the Restaurant Week special and chose the Stetson chopped salad mixed mushrooms with polenta and bread pudding  The Stetson chopped was amazing  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet savory crunchy soft once the salad is mixed up  I tried some of the testosterone salad which was decent and filled with a lot of well prepared beef but it didnt quite compare to the chopped salad  

Just as a general side note if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms so the mushrooms will taste bland to you  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more  

The bread pudding was amazing  Perfectly moist with lots of flavor and not too sweet  

Service was excellent Thanks Owen and along with the extensive selection of wines they also have some more unique beers such as lambic as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas The cream soda is locally made and very tasty"
5,Being English and missing a lot of the things we cant get over here we were delighted to have found this place  I have not tried all of the pasties and have stuck to the traditional ones that we get at home ie cheese and onion and cornish and they are very good  I sent my husband there to buy their half baked ones so we could freeze them and have whenever we get the craving and I ended up ordering 80 worth without any regrets  Needless to say my freezer is full of pasties and I even have a couple of ones I have not tasted before so looking forward to trying those  Have not eaten in the place either but quite frankly the food is that good I dont it would matter what its like inside  Also just noticed this is the Mesa shop we have only bought from the newly opened on in Tempe
5,"Even though the new place is limited on seating the food more than makes up the difference  

I took my wife and kids for lunch  We had some pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches fresh made slaw and mac and cheese made from scratch like mom used to make  The kids gobbled up the mac and cheese  The meat was definately cooked with love  

Gradys makes their own signature sauce in several varieties  They sell bottles of it as well  I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth

I also noticed they do catering  Ive had events catered by some other BBQ joints before but this food is much better quality and I think I can woo the crowds with Gradys BBQ

I fully recommend stopping into my new favorite barbeque place in Arizona

Thanks for making good food Grady  We all enjoyed it and writing this made me hungry for more"
5,"I love love love the chicken  hummus appetizer Its served w sauteed spinach and pita Although its an app its large enough for a light meal Most times I get that w the beet salad and split it w a friend Perfect 

For those of you who avoid beets I think youll change your mind w this salad The beets are sweet like candy  Served w feta mandarin oranges candied pecans and a very unique pear dressing you forget youre eating healthy Ive been trying to harvest the pear vinaigrette recipe forever They wont give up the secret sauce  

Enjoy"
5,I have shared many an awful hungover morning with my favorite stars from the Gay Corridor The service can be on the scary tweaker side but its a good simple breakfast that doesnt stress my dehydrated mind to find deliciousness Theyve also many different healthy options not that Ive ever done more than glance at those but its wonderful nonetheless Its the crown and glory of Park Central and the only reason I still consider Park Central an actual place as opposed to the reality of it just being a bad idea
5,"the customer service alone gets 5 stars but when you factor in the semiannual sales it is more like 6  Having been to a number of Nordstroms in multiple cities Id put this particular location on the same level as those in San Francisco without the assinine traffic to contend with and Seattle and only a notch below the best of the best in Chicago  

Living in a city with a Nordstrom and a Nordstrom Rack is going to be a daily exercise in resisting temptation"
1,"The absolute worse service Ive encountered My boyfriend son and I sat at a tepan table we were ignored for a good 1520 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink Once we had our drinks it took another 20 minutes to order our food By that time another family sat at our table My son  boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu I had sushi Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didnt get my sushi I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone elses order I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi The family on our table were so upset for us as well 

The food is excellent the service is so poor I am disappointed I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs they are great I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers 

I then gave it another try I met my girlfriends there We had dinner spent over 200 We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about We asked the managerowner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her socalled concern 

Again food is great service is lousy I am so disappointed and will not go back I will look elsewhere for my Caliente Rolls I hear Blu at the Wigwam is really good and servers are hospitable"
5,I am a huge fan of Saigon Nites A friend and I regularly eat here once weekly and we have NEVER had a bad experience The Steak Pho is amazing Typically when I Have Pho I load it up with hot sauces chili oil etcnot at Saigon Their Pho is ready to rock and roll the second it leaves the kitchen Two thumbs way up
5,Food is good to the tummy To me this is better than in and out burger Place is spotless  friendly service and wide selection
5,"Last night we met friends at Hillstones and we truly enjoyed a great meal and great atmosphere  
We were met by a very friendly and helpful server who took great care of us the entire evening  We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us  We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil  The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light  The croutons crisp and fresh baked  We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye OMG So moist and so juicy  the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it  The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large  I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I cant wait to go back  Was always a fan of Houstons in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing"
1,"Sadly with new owners comes changes on menu  My fav Barbecue chicken salad
no longer has a hint of the same taste It should now be called flavor of tomato 
 Also sad to find out that the most outstanding veggie sandwich now tastes like it comes from another country Again not a single hint of similarity of same flavor Im sure many people will love these new changes  Yet Im sad its not the same I woke up today dreaming about the old veggie sandwich No joking"
5,The mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich is the BEST sandwich in Phoenix hands down If you havent been to Pane Bianco you are truly missing out
1,This place is closed  Good riddance
5,Was looking for something refreshing for a nightcap on a hot Scottsdale night You will not be disappointed The sorbet was really tasty and refreshing
5,"still a big fan wonderful pizza
 Remember to join their birthday club"
5,You like hotdogs  Motor thats me says get in your Mommys oldsmobuick and get over to TEDS  AND you sissys that like sonoran style dogs talking smack about Teds go back to Tucson and eat your fru fru pineapple topped dogs with peanut butter   This is old style 4th of July chargrilled hotdogs and hamburgers  Makes my mouth water  Ok so visualize and taste this in your mind  First the juicy hamburgers that have the hardwood charcoal taste that makes your mouth water  The crispy ice berg lettuce juicy tomato and onion make this a purist burger lovers dream  Real good home made taste   So now act you like you always do on the 4th of July and get an all beef hotdog  First a warning  You will crave their hotdogs after you eat em  The crispy plump skin that cracks in your mouth and the taste is like when you were a kid and watching the fire works on the fourth  Add the spicy brown mustard with their ketchup hot sauce and buddy you got yourself dilemma  The dilemma you ask Is do you order one more hotdog cause they are soooo goood  Try the Italian for a spicy dog  Dont start with me on the fries and onion rings  Just make sure you wear your fat pants  Motor out and going back for another dog
5,"i have 2 words for you passive active dividing the dog park into sections based on tempermant isnt smart its fn brilliant 
2 gates upon entrance and exit safe it up so i have no worries that my shelter dog will hit the streets again 
this dog park is clean the people are friendly and so are the dogs finally a place where we can all get along"
5,Ive ordered pizza and wings three times and the have consistently created perfection seriously
5,"I was inspired to visit Casellas after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness As my tummy growled today I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go I walked into a simple yet clean deli Immediately I was welcomed by the entire staff I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine Celebrating their 33rd anniversary congrats I learned that everything is homemade  from the meatballs to the chicken salad The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious Im not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches looked great too The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin 

While I was there the owner was slicing some fresh provolone so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered The turkey was tasty the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven It was 8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later As I walked out everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner 

In summary heres what made Casellas stand out 

 The very friendly staff
 Its a local familyowned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary Gotta support the local businesses 
 Clean decor 
 Tasty homemade food thats on display for visitors to see 
 A good familystyle atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside 

Im not sure how its taken my so long to find this local treat but now that Ive found it I plan on becoming a regular 

Directions Note that this is hidden in the Bashas strip mall on the side of Granite Reef but dont let that fool you"
5,Very very good lunch spot  Was a little disappointed when I found out they didnt have pizza on their lunch menu But when I tasted the prosciutto sandwich I didnt mind anymore It was a great meal with a relaxing  great ambiance
5,My fav Mexican place by far  They make the most delicious chicken tortilla soup and tacos Ive ever eaten Fresh ingredients and the owners are super nice Love this place
1,Bad shop rude owners Protip If you want to enhance the Phoenix community you could start by not playing music loudly when its obvious that there are musicians trying to perform their sets that people paid to see at the wellrespected venue next door
5,Great food  Everything on the menu is good  The bacon guacamole burger is next to perfection
1,"Pure Fitness as a whole I like No contracts the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen ex LA Fitness Plus you get complimentary training sessions However this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldnt stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet Anyway I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid is it a money situation etcif made me VERY uncomfortable

 I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told mehe pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate My arms werent sore I know sore Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling and it hurt to use a freakin date stamp at work 

But the reason Im not going backI was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me just short of yelling Great now I lose the commission the gym loses the points you can understand why Im upset right and he went on for about 5 minutes I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and hes the GM If they work on commission they should give you a heads up hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up I would have respected that OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesnt circumvent them But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that 

Ps Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest visually unappealing and has the worst customer service I did sign up and I love the one I go to nowbut this one I will never step foot in again"
1,"Easily the worst burrito I have ever had
It amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better"
5,Love all their dishes
5,"To say this place is super rad would be an understatement  We for las noches de las luminarias  And I wish we couldve stayed longer also seeing the gardens during the daylight is added to the to do list  

Having never been there the staff was super helpful in guiding us not to mention really friendly  The music was entertaining and a good variety  They also have a synthetic ice rink and youre allowed up to 15 minutes of skating if youre not shy  The buffet they offered was a joke and I dont recommend doing it  For 1650 youre only allowed one trip through and other such silly stipulations no thanks   

Other than that what a great place to go"
5,"This is really worth taking the time to see and experience  The cost is very low  5 per adult  The garden is beautiful and peaceful with many areas where you can sit by yourself and reflect or just peoplewatch  Also the lady in the gift shop is very helpful if you are a first time visitor

Metro Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central"
5,"Yum yum yum Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away We didnt want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful The fig cake is delicious Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it

The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband Dont remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly 

Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow Weve since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people Enjoy"
5,I hardly ever get past their carne adovada Its simply amazing Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it Cant be beat I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also along with lamb chops chipotle both very very good Great atmosphere friendly competent staffa winning combination Get there early Long waits after 600pm
1,"Refused to give water to young teen  referred her to PF Changs  Olive  Ivy handled this poorly unprofessionally  pathetically 

PF Changs didnt even hesitate to give her the water  Thats why I ate there instead"
5,Great customer service nice owner The broth here is actually the best ive tasted in Arizona
5,"Yup Its all true Great food super charming place very intimate 

We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp Enjoyed the olives as a starter as well as some fried raviolis yes please and a caprese salad app  Outstanding artisan pizza with as good a crust as Ive ever had and homemade mozzarella Wine was just ok but very reasonable Server was attentive helpful and friendly Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful 

Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the fauxcowboys arriving in limos with 10gallon hats Then add a point back for the nearfight we got to watch between a biker and the fauxcowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac

Well be back and with more friends"
5,Had a celebratory lunch for a colleague today We had a group of ten Service and ambiance were great I had the best burger I can remember It was Lons special burger expensive at 16 but worth every penny  Highly recommend
5,"This place is great  I called at 830 am to make an appointment for that afternoon for 3 people  The place wasnt open yet but the phone was forwarded to I think the owners cell  He told me he would be at the store at 930 and hed call me back when he had the schedule in front of him  Sure enough at 930 he called me back and was able to schedule our appointments for 3pm

When we got there we were immediately brought back to a small room that had 3 big comfy chairs  We sat down and a couple minutes later they brought in 3 tubs of warm water for our feet  They reclined the chairs and started at our heads  They massage your face head neck shoulders arms hands feet and calves  The they tell you to turn over as they quickly turn the recliner into a massage table and proceed to massage your whole back sideall fully clothed  It was just wonderfuland all for 30  I definitely recommend"
5,"i miss this place so much its insanity 

ten high kentucky bourbon is all i can say and i never really cared how bad i felt the next day"
5,"Unlike other reviewers I didnt like the buffet though my friends from work think its a good value However Ive been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now and have ALWAYS liked the food FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley Ive tried 

Yes FOI is in a strip mall but once inside the ambiance is pleasant It seems quite clean I never got sick from anything I ate there thats saying a lot as I admit to being a fussy eater and the waitstaff is helpful Bollywood videos on the large flatscreen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature but the volume is low or completely muted so you can watch or choose not to it isnt distracting   Heres a footnote about that I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar watching electoral results so he asked our waiter if we could watch too After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables it was quite late in the evening silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on

Regarding the food I love their mattar paneer cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy with small cubes of homemade mildtasting cheese  My superspicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo superspiced as he requests  Tandoori shrimp chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier the samosa appetizer lightly battered and deepfried cut vegetables is fresh warm and crunchy Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be biryani rice is overpriced Id stick with basmati rice as a side dish and sweet lassi a wellchilled dairy drink similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy is a nice treat My spicy friend says his ginandtonic was weak and they dont have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary but hey FOI is an Indian restaurant so I cant fault them too much for that 

Other pluses open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants seating ends at 930 pm very fast with takeout orders theres lots of parking the 16 North bus stop is nearby silverware glasses white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean"
5,Just had takeout from here Amazing as always Had the carne asada torta DDelish
5,The chicken was unreal good  And the cornbread just as reviewers stated was heavenly  It was light and very good
5,"I am a big fan of this place either to stop in on a slow Sunday just to see what they have  Their stock rotates pretty frquently so always new interesting things to find  So far Ive bought a vintage print an awesome dress that I have received tons of compliments on cool earrings and some other kitchen items  The staff are always friendly  When you go make sure you check out the Burt Reynolds beefcake poster they have behind the counter

Great strore"

5,Great little place in a great little neighborhood Food was great service good and friendly and sitting amongst the rose bushes and garden made one feel as if we were having a nice relaxing Sunday breakfast in our backyard Love the place
5,"Why am I trying to hide my love

Im at Gallo Blanco Cafe at least three times a week  Yes its totally convenient  But then again so is that Rice Stick in a Bowl place around the corner and Im never there  

Im trading in my four stars for five stars  I never get tired of the food which is totally delish the drinks the jolt in the coffee the serversand THE HOTEL  

You guys always treat me well and I can see you treat everyone else like a rock star too

Thanks for being a great light rail convenient local business"
5,love the food and the services but you neesd to weight at 350ib to eat the burgers for free the burgers are big and jucey
1,"We found a bandaid with the panang  We ordered panang with chicken not panang with bandaid 

When we told the waiter he argued that it wasnt a bandaid  Im sorry theres no mistaking a bandaid  The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it

If you like bandaid on your dish this I the place to go

Too bad yelp doesnt allow 0 stars This place definitely was a ZERO"
5,I love to come here from time to time when Im in the area and I am always highly satisfied with the food and service The menu is great and theres a variety of dishes for every taste The service is great everyone is always really nice and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed Definitely a great place to have dinnerlunch with friends I read some other reviews from people who complained about the food mostly these were meat eaters Im assuming so of course they were not satisfied This is a 100 vegan restaurant note it
5,"T Cooks continues to be my goto spot with or without my fiance  Its like my home away from home  I feel comfortable going in for a drink or a bite to eat any night of the week  Let me be clear about one thing however  I always sit at the bar

In addition to the regular menu items the burger at T Cooks is consistently amazing This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now

Anyone up for a burger"
5,"I just started taking my car here a few months ago Someone from their business stopped by my office building with donuts and coupons for a 60000 mile check up and thats how they got my business

I brought my car there for a routine oil change and they did the 60000 mile check up which was very useful Of course there was the usual list of things I should fix but they never made me feel like an idiot or that they were taking advantage of me which I cant say for most mechanics

The other thing I really like about them is they give me a ride to and from work so I can get maintenance done on my car without missing work or worrying about how Im going to get back to the shop

Bill and the other guys that work there are all very friendly and I definitely trust them with my car needs"
5,"I love Lulus cupcakes They always have a perfect amount of frosting and alot of their cupcakes are better than the ones at sprinkles This is because they seem to be moister and hold themselves together better 
I love the raven The Sales people are nice
 So yummy And I love that the place is pink"
5,I recommend this to everyone  I have never had a bad meal here  Inexpensive great service off the beaten path Love this place
5,Ive been going to Orange theory for awhile and I cant believe how much Ive toned up and slimmed down I havent bulked up and now Im on my way to getting my bikini body back I highly recommend this work out Its so awesome and I cant believe I can get my full work out in an hour
5,"Oh my gooooooooodness  I love this store  I have been a tea enthusiast ever since I received a cast iron tea pot for Christmas  A few weeks ago I purchased a Groupon for 20 worth of merchandise for 10 and headed over to the store  The experience was amazing  The varieties were intriguing the prices were reasonable and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly  Also the layout of the store was appealing and inviting  

When we visited the store we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday  I hope there will be many more to come"
1,After looking for a car wash  vacuum in the area I selectioned Francis  Sons I checkeed thier priced on thier website but when I got thier the price they wanted to charge was much more they kept trying to sell an upholstery cleaning and then said I dont take care of my care so there would be an additional 20 to clean the black plastic exterior pieces I only wanted a qhick exterior  clean and vacuum They refused to honor thier website pricing and insisted that what I read on thier website was not on there Needless to say I didnt get my car washed there I would highly recommend AVOIDING these crooks
5,"I violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to Whole Foods  Whole Foods tends to be the indecisive individuals nightmare that would be me  Yet this store is a foodies dream 

There are aisles upon aisles of glorious wholesome products pun intended  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item  No joke  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable and economical 

I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling its preystrategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation  Did I want a madetoorder wrap  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas the live music was alluringMaybe sushi  Pizza  Salad bar  Soup Maybe something from the smokehouseoooh A cupcake from the cupcake bar 

On and on it went 

My final decision was sushi The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp I also grabbed a container of ginger for 199not the artificially preserved pink varietyallnatural pickled ginger  Bliss  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a sidepalate cleanser All in all a very satisfying meal 

Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store Then again it is Whole Foods A word of advise  come with a game plan eg a shopping list If you dont define what it is you want prior to entering this store youll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated"
5,Beautiful little gem of a restaurant  Great outdoor seating amazingtruly amazing mussels  Wholeheartedly recommend perfect date night too
5,The restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere but I really love the food here Ive eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout I love the Gobi Manchurian Vegetable Vindaloo and Special Vegetable Curry I also like the weekend buffet  its a great way to try several different things Delicious
1,"This has to be the worst restaurant in terms of hygiene Two of my friends had food poisoning after having dinner here The food is just unhealthy with tons of oil floating on the top of curries and I am not sure if any healthhygiene code is followed here 
The service is poor and the information on its website is incorrect the owner does not allow dinein after 9 or 10 even though it says that the restaurant is open till 11 

One night I saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a togo parcel without cleaning her hands great example to the servers I had a peek inside the kitchen when the door was ajar and it definitely looked dirty

I have been a lot of holeinthewall places around this restaurant including Haji Baba the Vietnamese place and others but neither any of my friends nor I have fallen sick coz of the food If you need a spicyfood fix i strongly recommend you do not try this place lest you want a visit to the doctor the very next day"
5,"Once we went to Grimaldis in Hoboken NJ and werent all that impressed  Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldis we were blown away  

Upon entering you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coalfired oven  This is swooninducingand I mean that in a good way  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coalfired oven in the Northeast

When ordering pizza baked in a coalfired oven I like to get a plain cheese pizza  IMO this is the best way to fully taste the sauce cheese and crust without anything else get in the way  

Theres nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coalfired oven with that char on the crust  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano  The amount of cheese is just right  I love to savor each and every bite

There is more to this Grimaldis than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge  This one has other items in addition to the pizza  We like their antipasto  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy black and green olives the black ones are pitted the green ones have pits in them  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor and a good flavorful salami

Everytime were in AZ it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldis"
1,Terrible servicethey replaced my phone screen and it broke within 2 wks Phone was not dropped or mishandled just cracked and owner would not honor their warranty They only accept cashthat should be a red flag if you are considering a business like this
5,"Championship establishment here

I walked in with my significant other and was surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night At first it didnt click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy

They have some really good specials but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are 6 Big misunderstanding most 6 are single patty and have some special toppings Zipps decided to do a doublestacked specialtly burger Yes two 13 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings We got two burgers and split them half and half green chile burger and sweet jalapeno Both were extremely awesome You can get salad fries onion rings or halfhalf half fries half onion rings The fries kind of taste like InnOut fries and my significant other would describe them as being better I dont agree and I dont disagree Overall good food I cant wait to come back and try something else from their special menu The 6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8close and weekends from 114

The service was really awesome They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well Apparently they also were understaffed but it honestly did not feel like it Seriously though it was some of the best service Ive ever had at a Phoenix restaurant To top it all off the manager had checked up on us a few times and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter pizzookie or cookie with ice cream

Now Im not a fan of pizzookie but wow their cookie platter was awesome It wasnt on special that night but I know its on special some other night and at 4 its probably worth a go again Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter Its just as good if not better than BJs

I am actually excited to go here again With some really good food specials almost any night I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of The food is a little greasy but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill Want to lose 50 lbs go to subway Props to the owners for such an awesome establishment"
5,This place is amazing The food was delicious the waffle was like no other  The service was great very attentive and nice I will be returning
5,"We make it a tradition to come here whenever family is in town So Ive probably been here atleast 10 times

Love their steak with buttered plates Weve had it before where the streak wasnt cooked to our satisfaction But after being there so many times I know how to order it Sweet potato casserole is excellent Cesar salad is the best Ive ever had On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly but Ive had it before where they are like buzzing bees I usually like to have tea after dinner which is always nice 

The atmosphere is good It is nicer to sit in the main dining area near the windows instead of the side room

Also people if you are going to spend hundred dollars on dinner dont cheap out on a babysitter Nobody wants to listen to your whinnying little brat kids who cant sit still Ruth Chris should have an age requirement

Ive been to Mortons twice Once in Chicago and once in Phoenix and both times it wasnt as good as Ruth Chris"
5,"Postinos on the East side

Whoa you like to think that youre immune to Postinos oh yeah
Its closer to the truth to say I cant get enough 
You know Im gonna have to face it Im addicted to Postinos 

Thanks Robert Palmer and lets just say I wouldnt be surprised to see the fashion models around here  Very attractive crowd  I am honor just to be here  

Another bottle of wine and youll be mine a one track mind 
I cant be saved 
4 flavors of Bruschetta is all I crave 
If theres some left for you 
and dont mind if I do 

I might as well face it Im addicted to Postinos

Ive always enjoyed attending Postinos on the West side of town but the East side adds a new flavor  The place still has a great deal on Monday and Tuesday nights  Bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschettas for 20  The ambience is always chill and low lighting  Quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and Im golden here  Service is always great at Postinos  The staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular  Enjoy"
5,"Rula Bula gets five stars from me for two reasons

1 Perfect fish and chips
2 One of the only correctly poured Guinness drafts in AZ

They could punch me in the neck when I walked in and i would still give them five stars for those two reasons

Almost all the food is good though I can count the number of times Ive had anything other than the above on one hand The happy hour is great with half off appetizers including the fish nuggets which are the fish n chips I eat before I eat the fish n chips

The worlds most competitive trivia night These people STUDY for trivia night 

Great outdoor seating good service Decor is interesting especially if you like this particular famous race horse that I currently forget the name of but is the subject of approximately 90 of the wall art"
5,"One of my favorite places to come Their salsa and guacamole is to die for I like that they bring each person their own individual bowl of salsa 

I ways get their huevos rancheros with beans and rice  homemade flour tortilla Delicious

I eat the entire plate every time"
5,Great place enjoyed the amenities Pool was great and view on the property was very picturesque Food in the property restaurants were very good Definitely would stay there again if ever in Scottsdale again
5,What would I do without this place  They pretty much anything you need to make any Asian home cooked meals  Very clean  Fresh produce fresh seafood fresh meat  I love how they have pre sliced meats  This is definitely one of the largest Asian supermarkets in the valley  Avoid the the 2 asian restaurants in the market though  Theyre not very good
5,"love Love LOVE

How can you not fall in love with this store the moment you walk in is beyond me Its like entering that magical fairy tale land your mind goes to every time I start to sing or sit down at my piano And thats exactly what a music store should be It should bring you to that creative center where the outside world doesnt exist 

First and foremost the staff is extremely friendly both on the phone and in person Ive spent I dont know how much of their time having them assist me in finding sheet music and theyve always been a gem and even gone so far as to go google searches for me while I was there and give me some additional leads Its just an awesome amazing experience 

They also never seem to mind me going in and gawking at instruments for hours on end I always tell myself someday I am going to learn a new instrument and going in there causes me to think of at least 10 I want to play especially when I stare at the drums

Go to Milano and experience what a music store is supposed to be"
5,"What else can I say that hasnt been said already  

Im weirdly glad that theyre not closer  in fact very far away from me because Ill be there every day  gaining tons of weight

My baby loved the mango lassi flavor So much he did the sign for more  for the first time at the store

I do want to try the bacon flavorso a trip soon is in order"
5,LOVE THIS PLACE  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town  My husband eats here during the week too  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick  The veggie soup is delicious  The golden wings  Delicious chicken satay is good too  For an entree we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home east valley but havent found one yet  Service is terrific  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai it is very sweet here so if you dont like it sweet order something else  Other things weve tried that were good pepper steak  very good  just dont eat a lot of red meat massamum curry with chicken good also we order everything medium to thai hot like very spicy
5,Prices are good nobody is down your throat when you enter and its the best place for produce in town literally would suggest this place over trader joes for sure
5,"I found this place via Google while in town for business Its tucked away in a nondescript strip mall next to a Salvation Army

Ive had dinner and lunch here both times were good For dinner I had the special turkey sandwich with fries fries werent pipping hot when they were served but still good for the lunch visit I had the original g spicy poboy and chose the curry pasta salad as a side  tasty

Service was friendly and efficient


Update 
121007  Whats the first thing I do when I arrive in Phoenix Punch in 2240 N Scottsdale Road in my GPS and head to Green This time around I had Thee Argentine PoBoy with fried  Mock steak fried with onions and peppers vegan mayo and a spicy sauce I couldnt get enough Very delicious

121107  After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe I thought Id balance it out by having something healthy for dinner  I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice The description looked good veggies in a spicy sauce  but it was a little too salty for my taste and didnt finish it Oh well cant win them all

121207  I was working close by so decided to run in for lunch I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw It was a little bit messy to eat by hand with the tomato sauce and soy mozzarella oozing everywhere  still good nonetheless The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich

121407  Ill miss you Green"
5,"No need for a long review

Every InNOut I have ever been too has been amazing

Great Food
Great Customer Service

Love this place"
5,I love Petco The only place I go to get dog food I feel like the employees generally know what they are talking about and are always willing to help
5,"Wow is this some fantastic food It was the first non chain restaurant we ate at during our vacation and I couldnt be more pleased Not only was the staff friendly and attentive the food was phenomenal Presentation and taste were top notch The Tai fried rice was the best fried rice Ive ever had I will definitely be back the next time Im in town

Visit Date 111809"
5,"LOVE this place Great food high quality ingredients which is why i was told the prices are a bit more than your typical pizza hut and fun service

I love this place and always leave happy and full Authentic italian food is my weak spot "
1,Have been an Ulta customer for a long time but had never tried the salon until recently  Was a HORRIBLE experience  My stylist Delia ran 45 minutes late to start me and on several occasions during the hair cut stopped and kept looking around  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess  She not only didnt listen to what I wanted but shot down the only thing I did ask for  She said I wouldnt look good  At the end of the painful ordeal she then charged me for a conditioning service I didnt ask for  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store after which I waited in they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction  happened twice then I asked for a manager  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back
1,Sadly I have to join the crowd on this one I was hoping that Kitchen 56 would make my memories of Vatra go away but instead just reminded me all over again Food was WAY overpriced and just OK Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56 Id give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service  personality I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation but the spots lights at the counterheight 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last calland I dont drink
5,We loved this place
5,One of favorite happy hour places in town If you get the wings here it shouldnt matter if you get anything else Great location and nothing else needs to be said Maybe a renovation on the parking lot
5,Love the wings
5,"Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you  Selections include gumbo pan roasts a tomatobased broth with chunks of seafood or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp crab chicken crawfish oysters or all five with rice They also have fresh oysters jumbo shrimp cocktails salads and tasty seafood chowder as well as the occasional lobster special Ive been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish The staff is friendly and helpful and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort

As another reviewer noted this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables stuck right off the casino floor This is definitely not a fine dining spot with the clanging of slot machines and deadeyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away Still its definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick At 1012 for lunch portions and 1719 for huge dinner servings and 25 for a massive platter of oysters shrimp crab mussels and clams its a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food  Good reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley but this spot is a gem"
5,Sometimes its difficult to really feel satisfied with a raw vegan diet  but every time I go to Pomegranates I leave more than satisfied   The atmosphere is welcoming and delightful although very busy during the lunch rush I did have to share a table with a stranger last time I was there but the stranger turned out to be a great lunch companion  This is a must for anyone who is considering or already is a raw andor vegan diet  Everything is so yummy you wont know it is good for you
5,"Simply awesome Great beer and great staff Will try the food next time Only complaint is a bartender named Adrianne she is crazy Ha G

The food was excellent from the great hard boiled egg dish to the peanut butter and jelly with banana and marshmallow fluff oh and add bacon  Elvis just did a sommersault in his grave  The sandwiches are not huge but they are all made like the beer served and the people hosting of finest quality  

Really enjoyed and will spread the word"
5,Best breakfast in west Chandler  I love their crepe eggs and calorienutritional info printed on the menu
5,While we were in Mesa AZ for a holiday we found Alessias on Yelp and we are so glad we did The food was delicious and the host was terrific as were the servers We are not big wine drinkers but they have a very good selection of wines and the host knows his stuff and can make good recommendations Nicely appointed little restaurant with a great menu
5,"I used to go here about once a week when I still lived and worked in Arizona My office at the time was within walking distance

This is a very good Hooters locationlocated smack dab in the middle of Mill Avenue right next to ASU Plenty of stores all around 

I used to go mainly for lunches during the week with coworkers It usually was quieter than evenings or weekends The serving staff were great and many of the ladies would stand and chat for quite a whileas it was pretty slow"
5,"After visiting family in Scottsdale last weekend hubby and I spent 3 wonderful days at the Boulders Resort in Carefree We arrived a little tired and stressed we left tan relaxed and rejuvenated

The resort sprawls beneath the boulder formations but you can walk all over on the paths that are well marked Our room was spacious and clean with his and hers sinks in the bathroom shower tub king sized bed and walkin closet We were located near the main lodge and a brisk walk from El Pedregal and the Golden Door Spa We made great use of the wonderful fitness center and took a few classes as well yoga bosu and water fitness

We tried both pools during our stay the spa pool and the main pool We preferred the tranquility of the spa pool food and drinks at both locations were exceptional If you meet Madonna at either pool ask her to make the Madonna Special for you A very refreshing smoothie

During our stay we ate dinner twice at the Spotted Donkey Cantina at El Pedregal fabulous margaritas shrimp tacos Our last night we dined at Rustys Chop House at the golf club It was a lovely meal on the terrace with a view of the golf course 

Every person we ran into was exceptionally friendly and genuine making the trip even more enjoyable I hope we return someday"
5,"They have the BEST Pad Thai  Ive had many other dishes of theirs which are all delicious but that Pad Thai haunts my dreams at night In a good way  Ive recently had Touch of Thai which is a highly rated Thai Food restaurant  Of course I had to try their pad thai  Honestly It was just as good but they used the thin stringy noodles and Dara uses the wide flat noodles  You wouldnt think that would make much of a difference but thats what makes me drive 20 miles more to go to Dara Thai to get their Pad Thai than driving 5 miles to go to Touch of Thai 

If your not watching your calorie intake I highly suggest getting the cream cheese wontons and Thai Tea with your Pad Thai  Now thats what I call delicious"
5,Baffled by the unfavorable reviews here Easily one of the best burgers Ive ever had is the Zinburger Truffle fries are also delicious Always have good service here and leave very satisfied Atmosphere is slightly upscale I suppose but not snobby as some complain You can wear shorts and a Tshirt and feel right at home here
5,This place is what Desert Ridge wishes it was Its great for groceries WalMart bargain hunting TJ Maxx fast food or dining in tons of places catching a movie Harkins stocking up the wine shelf BevMo new panties Vickys Secret and a zillion other things I love that this is close to my house The only thing that would make it better is a Costco or Sams Club
1,"Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious snooty bullshit I should have known the second I realized that BlissreBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil

And so it is We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty There is no hostess or even a hint of one We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around perhaps serving to invisible people The place was dead We were told there was a 15 minute wait or we could eat on the patio Um its 40 degrees  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD I guess well wait We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes Thats sure inviting isnt it

So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections 9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me so I go with the veggie sandwich That sounds innocuous enough right The food came out straightaway  too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well like my companion ordered Sure as shit she cut into it and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place My veggie sandwich arrives and it looks like a FiletoFish from hell some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deepfrying I couldnt help it  I asked the server what the hell it was 

Eggplant

Ohhhhkay then 

It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows Impossible The pretzel bread while yummy is totally unyielding Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing

So while we are attempting to recover from this mess the server goes MIA Youd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there wed get a damn check Nope No Nada Had to chase someone down and ask for it When it finally came there wasnt even an itemized receipt so even though the total seemed a little low I couldnt check it out I was so over the whole experience at the point I didnt even care I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable 3 vodka specials for the next four hours 

Just UGH in every way"
5,Had the mahi and it was great  Very reasonably priced also  Definitely a repeat
5,"I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich until now  I even gave the same statement to the owner  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out and while I was waiting I let him know my frustrations  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought  Well it was FANTASTIC  Of course I called him back to let him know  

The service and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place  

There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too  I cant wait to go back and try some more"
5,"This place is just so so rad It was about time that AZ has a high end sneaker boutique

The selection of sneakers as well as clothes is above all No kidding I bought a pair of limited edition Jordans as a gift here All of the sneakers here a so unique and fun and it really puts the fun in sneaker shopping again 

Sure you can go to finish line and get a pair of sneakers there And you will see various other people wearing the same ones If you really want to find funky stuff to express yourself with this is the place AND to make it even betterthey sell for retail So markups Not an issue

Do yourself a favor and check this place out"
5,Dr Jason Kanarish is absolutely amazing  I am a Physician Assistant in surgery and  appreciated his bedside manner as well as medical knowledge which was phenomenal  He spent AMPLE TIME with me and answered EVERY QUESTION I had  Not to mention he was fantastic with my scared min pin I cannot recommend him enough  The staff is also extremely friendly and helpful
1,Nice selection of stuff but they have so little help available you will wait for darn near forever to get fabric cut THEN wait in line forever to pay  For such a giant store it appears there are 3 employees  Thats it  I miss Hancock Fabrics THEY knew how to treat customers
5,"Just open  I had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the turkey and stuffing sandwich  Both were excellent modern interpretations on classic lunches  I highly reccommend this place

PS  iPad driven POS system is way cool"
5,"I dont frequent Tempe too often but when I do I try to get a Tea Infusion run in everytime I succeed I literally have a grin on my face after every sip 

Its the least strip mallesque dining option in the whole of Tempe Market place and that is a BIG PLUS in my book Add to that that they make Boba Smoothies the way I like them how could I resist

Case in point The Pumpkin Chai Based off the rattlings of fellow yelpers I decided to try the chai and asked if it could be bobafied which makes me want to say Boba Fet and they said SURE It was delish but that was summer and now its winter and so warm sounded yummy but I had never had a hot boba drink before So I asked them if I could have it with boba and hot and what did they say SURE But be careful its hot And oh so YUM

I think they deserve the taglines Have it your way and Any way you want it more than Burger King Because out of all the Boba places in Metro Phoenix they are the only ones that have never said No to me before with Boba Juice coming in a close second but only because their range of options is less

Add to that that they have a Boba Smoothie called Carribbean Colada and it is a pretty comparable alternative to my favorite Pineapple Lychee flavor that only the now defunct AZN of Mesa could prepare for me so with just 2 of their drink options I am in Boba heaven wonder what else they have in store for me if I ever tire of my usual options and try something different dont know if I can I might have to do a gluttonous double order or siptaste from a friends selection

But wait Bobas not all theyve got theyve got a tea list comparable to that of Cheesecake Factories menu it is a long one Ive had a blueberry tea strawberry and a coconut one and they were all pretty tasty Ive also had a panini there and it was quite tasty and fillingI took leftovers home

My only wish is that the space Tea Infusion is housed in was more spacious with lounge seating in addition to table options so one can really settle in and work or chat with friends but heck Im just happy theyre here and serving the valley some teatastiness

Ill tea back REAL SOON"
5,We purchased a Groupon deal and went and tried this restaurant  The food is excellent and the service is very good  If you are wanting real Texas BBQ then this is the place to go
5,As close to a real east coast deli as youll find west of the Appalachians Delicious sandwiches egg creams etc Pricy but kids apparently eat free in summer so we kept it at 5 stars
5,We searched our phones for a place to go to have some Ceviche This restaurant received some good reviews so we drove down from NE Phoenix and were a little skeptical on the location but our concerns were immediately set at ease once we stepped inside What a great little place with very friendly staff We really appreciated the cleanliness too We ordered the shrimp ceviche shrimp in green sauce and shrimp and broccoli in cream sauce Everything was outstanding Even the simple rice and beans were absolutely delicious And the tortillas  uhmazin Danielle was wonderful and we truly enjoyed her service We will definitely come back and bring friends next time Between the two of us we already texted half our friends about this place and we havent even finished eating yet RECOMMENDED FOR SURE
5,"   O M G So GOOD     

My family  I keep coming back to this place We drive over 10 miles to get our fix I think its safe to say that we are officially hooked and when we are jonesin for Tacos Atoyac there better not be anyone or anything standing between us and our Food

Today we all came aways lickin our chops and yummy in our Tummy I might not brush my teeth tonight

Heres what we had

 I had scrambled eggs with chorizo dry cheese onions potatoes and Jalapenos Served with side of refried black beans and spicy rice and a little plate of grilled onions sweet  tastey and jalapenos

 The little woman had a Spicy burritoal  pastor cheese onions jalapenos mayo avocado 

 The kid had 5 mini carne asada tacos with cheese"
5,"I love the owners  Very friendly and accomodating  One night we had called after they had closed and were pleasantly surprised when someone answered  Turns out they were hosting a private party  They agreed to take our order which made us pretty happy

I adore their Greek fries  Olive oil lemon and the perfect amount of fetta  Been here several times for lunch and always leave happy  Looking forward to meeting friends here for happy hour"
5,Awesome resort  I was able to stay there to celebrate a birthday in July and fortunately it wasnt as hot as it usually is  I am a wimp when it comes to heat but the resort was wonderful even with many things being closed  The summer is off season for this spot  We had a great time at the spa and lying by the pool  Be sure to have your food and drinks served there  It feels so luxurious
1,Goddess got it right  This place is pretty and it looks so promising  Big disappointment   There was nothing for vegetarians  The food was mediocre at best  Id choose Pho Nhat over this pretty restaurant any day  Dont judge a book by its cover  No good
1,This is a sad excuse for a gay resort  Sort of like a worn out version of Palm Springs  We found the Zen Yard up on Maryland Avenue a much more agreeable experience in a better neighborhood as well  Zen Yard is a far better value with full breakfasts included and warm helpful hosts as well not to mention particularly reasonable offseason rates and hosts who are actually there for their guests
5,"In times of big corporations it was nice to find such a warm and friendly coffeehouse in the valley It is just a great place to hang out setup your laptop or read a book I thoroughly enjoyed my Joltachinno a much better version of the Starbucks frappacino which is just too sweet 
We came back another day for lunch and all I can say is yum I have never had food like this at a coffeehouse
Amazingly for our second time there they recongnized us WOW  I am glad that I have found my new hangout when I come to the valley"
5,Great food and service Normally a wait on the weekend but what would you expect
5,"best coffee in phoenix so far experienced and friendly baristas a large sitting area inside nice decorations community conscious promotes local art and artists outdoor sitting area easily accessible location from the light rail and from the portland park neighborhood 

i had a short vanilla cappuccino and the thing that made it the best insofar to my search for phoenixs best espresso was definitely the milk it was properly steamed microfoam the shots were right on too

the milk ive had elsewhere in phoenix doesnt compare thumbs up to fair trade"
5,"this place rules plain and simple

just wish they had a cheaper jukebox"
1,If you have to be some place on time dont use them  I called at 2pm for a 415 taxi to arrive  At 425 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner and gave me his location  Estrella called a couple more times to verify my address  At 435 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor  As we pulled out of my neighborhood we PASSED the cab He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost This is a TAXI service they should know how to get around the valley  Dont these people use GPS or MAPS at least  End of story I was still late for my class that I paid 25000 bucks for I was not allowed in and the money is non refundable  So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money  WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER
5,"There are certain people in your life that you should have  trust A good mechanic is high on that list 

I found out about Whiteys Auto through twitter Many of my friends were communicating with Scott the GM and I started following him too His tweets were funny authentic and relevant and not always about auto repair The most important aspect of his tweets Theyre immediate

At the time I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didnt need to go to Whiteys for service However when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it Scott responded for me to call him and hed help me out 

Although Whiteys doesnt do body work their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right He had made me a lifelong customer at that point 

When my boyfriends truck kept leaking oil and he wasnt getting results at the shop he was taking it to I took him to Whiteys and introduced him to Scott With one check Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for Scott told him if he didnt mind the leak he could put off the service work as it wasnt something imperative And he didnt charge him for the assessment

Recently the belts on my car fell off causing my ac to go out  lights to come on my dash My warranty was over but I didnt even hesitate I just turned right around and took my car to Whiteys Replacement belts and labor plus they checked my battery and charged it for me cost 80 less than it would have at the dealership 

The inexpensive cost along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust make Whiteys irreplaceable Dont hesitate to take your vehicle there first when you need service"
5,"I would never have picked a museum cafe for lunch even though it is practically in my own backyard but with my friends endless ravings about their Dreamcatcher Salad I relented  And Im glad I did  Its now become a staple for lunch meetings

The dining area is bright and cheerful but the outdoor patio is truly a delight on a beautiful day  It is serene and is surrounded by a plethora of desert plants and a lovely water feature

The menu is rather short on items but long on freshness and flavor  Many of the offerings lean towards Southwestern style  I have found my favorites on the menu in particular the Hummus Veggie Wrap which is filled to the brim in a healthy spinach tortilla with Tepary bean hummus tomatoes roasted red bell pepper grilled red onions pepitas smoked gouda and romaine  Ive tried to duplicate this wrap at home with underwhelming success  Each sandwich comes with the choice of salad or chips The portions are hearty

The service is attentive but not intrusive

An absolutely divine dine"
5,"Pizzeria Bianco Before and After 
Cited as the best pizza in America in numerous online reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in Slice of Heaven to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience But to the true pizza enthusiast Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday from 510 pm for nearly 15 years of which I was one of those fortunate customers However early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years Horatio Hernandez 
My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009 I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened and this beautiful fall day was no exception I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us we assumed we would make the 500 seating with no trouble However just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party so were the 20 or so people ahead of us and when the door opened promptly at 500 there were now over 50 people ahead of us Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time 
When we were seated at 600 the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added We ordered three pizzas the Sonny Boy providing salami marinara sauce and gaeta olives the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another slice of heaven 
And so after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen curiosity got the best of me I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for April 6 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all My date and I arrived at approximately 400 pm one hour before the doors would open We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said almost in unison Well the wait hasnt changed 
Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale Four Peaks to help pass the time We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow I was star struck and could barely speak All I could muster up was Are you cooking tonight To which he replied No I have Horatio at the oven I cant cook anymore I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same We took a picture and off he went back to the bar 
At 615pm after 225 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris As for the meal it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch just like the first time From the wait to the taste it didnt appear that anything had changed 
So what makes for the best pizza in America and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line Well my opinion is flavorful ingredients a phenomenal social experience and an owner who lives by what he serves To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff you havent skipped a beat"
5,"OK ok ok  Ill have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isnt deadon authentic Mexican food  That being said I love it  The place is huge sporting a bakery said many times before with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries not said as many times before a little carniceria not as good as Carniceria Sonora and a huge dining area  

The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice 2 Dos Equis  

The food  thats probably the only tougher part  Keep in mind its still pretty good but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise  The potato taco is worth getting because its fairly unique but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork  I grabbed a couple of the YelpAdvertised taquitos as well  keep in mind these are not the Circle K rolling taquitos  They are literally just smaller tacos but they were damn good

I guess when it comes down to it Im an atmosphere buff  There were so many cool things to check out in this multiplex and the atmosphere was so warm that Id love to head back again soon"
5,"Being my first review there is only one place Ive always had a 5star experience Hoodlums is the ultimate musiccdvinylDVDused music store in the Valley ZIA and Stinkweeds are a distant second in terms of selection price and overall experience

Steve and Kristian are two of the nicest local business owners Ive ever met They know a ton about music and the local scene Theyll help you find anything you need

Tucked in the SW corner of Guadalupe and McClintock next to Traders Joes this is a special place to find that CDDVD youve been waiting to purchase 

They also have a wide selection of used CDs and DVDs to are at bargin prices be sure to check that out too"
5,Great groceries and fantastic service keep it up
5,"If you really care about your health and want a sincere doctor who honestly cares about his patients and believes in his practice then this is the doctor for you I am a 40yearold woman who couldnt be happier with the care I have received and how I feel after seeing Dr E for the past year I recommend Dr E to all my friends and family and the ones who actually listen have been very happy with their care as well 

In response to Lisa N it is possible that you are one of the few people who is immune to Botox and similar products which is to no fault of the doctor I too was extremely unhappy with subsequent treatments given by another doctor only to find out that no amount of the toxin would ever be effective for me because my immune system works too well Ironic isnt it 

You should always do your homework when looking for a new doctor especially when you know exactly what type of treatment you are seeking For example if you are simply interested in the HCG diet program instead of overall health and you had been elsewhere for less money then likely that place is a better match for you 

We dont live forever but we can live better while we are here Take control of your medical care its your body and therefore your decision Dr E at Carefree Health Path is a great place to start your empowering journey to health"
5,"When we first moved to Ocotillo the first thing we did was peruse yelp for the best local eateries Mikado was one of the first things to splash onto our radar and we had to check it out Luckily for us Mikado is literally a 2 minute drive from our house 

The restaurant is lowkey and I like how the lighting is a little dimmer than usual to create a more mellow ambience The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable 

So anyway on to the sushi I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because its so ginormous They stuff 3 large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce LOVE And while Im on the subject Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura Their tempura shrimp is super crispy isnt greasy and always fresh out of the fryer The Crunch Roll is superb the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious Their prices are great and you still get so much food How can you go wrong If youre within a 20 mile radius of Mikado you need to stop by

Also I cant say this enough Please support your local businesses They depend on your patronage"
1,Went with three others My first  last visit  The menu did not properly describe the item and instead of a bell pepper dish I got a port dish It was dreadful The other three I went with were not very happy with their meals either  The restaurant was extremely noisy Not pleasant at all  terrible food Will never go back  A big disappointment  They cant even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish The sauce apparently contained pulverized peppers Are they stupid  I should have trusted my instincts  not the commercial  Its a third world country They can barely afford to feed themselves They have no history of cuisine  I wouldnt waste my time and money on this place again
5,"Loves the recent Cezanne show In fact Ive seen it twice in the last week I need to find out more about who curated the exhibit as it is very fine The Oriental collection is very nice and soothing 
The Downtown Chamber Group gave a wonderful concert in the great hall on Sunday I wonderful and unusual program of saxophone and harp I think it is great to have music in the galleries I liked the musicians being on a platform since the room isnt banked one can see the performers
A few things Im not so crazy about
The great room is this awesome space for large art Sunday I sat and looked at it for several hours You know not such great art I find the Terrill boring and the other pieces uninteresting
The cafe never quite lives up to its promise My lunch companion barley touched her lunch and the waiter never asked why or offered a box
Enough grousing I love the place and go often"
1,Not only was the music the worst I have ever heard the wait staff was as annoying as ever Like a wanna be swanky place in a strip mall that smells like fish and plays horrible music Food was so so but over priced for what it was
5,"Ive always been partial to Harkins Theaters because they have the best seats  I used to say You know what would be the best theater  AMC experience with Harkins seats

Guess what AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that  I love this place  Its frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it  Not to mention an IMAX  The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable

Nothing really more to say that its a theater  I do like the new Stubs card that they put out  Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it but its only 12 a  year  Not bad for all the free stuff you get

Another cool thing about this theater is the location  If you are going to grab dinnerlunch before hand ther eis a ton of places to choose from

Nice work AMC on making a great theater

Ohhh big big big heads up  Be sure to see a movie before Noon or ya get to pay nice big money   thats probably the draw back  Ill still give you 5 stars"
5,"I attended a UYE Unofficial Yelp Event here and I have to say that Haus Murphys pretty much wowed all 20 or so of us

It has taken me over a week to get to the review  I was still reflecting on the German meatloaf red cabbage and Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen

How do you say Damn that was good in German  I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman not sure about the spelling there

The fubar of Yelpers I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers dined on the patio which is a great space  Service was very good throughout the meal

There was quite a bit of sharing going on and although I dont remember everything I tried it was all really good

It was great to see so many friends and meet some new Yelpers like Norm"
1,"Avoid this einsteins at all cost I have been laying in bed puking for over 12 hours because I ate at this garbage dump The reason I know it was them My girl is laying next to me puking as well And the only place we both ate together less than 24 hours ago was there

The incompetent staff that happens to grace this poorly operating business cannot tell the difference between a large drink and a medium and take over 10 minutes to make two identical sandwiches

After we got home and ate them fast forward 6 hours and we are both puking our brains out

The most common reason for this to happen is when an employee does not wash their hands after getting feces on them Then they touch my food and I get sick Based on the staff that day it does not surprise me one bit

I would recommend starving over going here Never again Now I will go speak to Ralph on the big white telephone some more"
5,"I LOVE love LOVE Coffee Bean  I have been in love with Coffee Bean for years  I am so bummed out that they are not all over the place like the S coffee store  

One of my favie drinks are the Pure Cholocate Ice Blended with whip cream and Green Tea Latte  The service is always friendly perky and fully of sunshine"
5,Very good place to eat I go here atleast 3 times a week and the owners are very good people they always interact with their customers I pretty much know the owners and everytime I go there they already know what I want I highly recommend this place
5,"Taste buds went CRRRAAZZYYY

Finally made it to the much raved about Pizzeria Bianco and happy I did It was absolutely delicious Thankfully we made it at a good time where we didnt have to wait at all for a table YES I ordered the Margherita and was deliciously pleased However my sister opted for the Biacoverde and boooy was I jealous It was awesome and my favorite by far"
5,Dr Ford is great  She came highly recommended and I can see why  Very focused and caring assessment of my Dog  Bring your animals here they will be taken care of properly
5,"Everyone point and laugh at the nerd reviewing a convenience store

Oh yeah Stuff it Like donuts Check this out

Get in your car and drive here around 3AM and try their donuts Had every single donut place in the area and nothing can hold a candle to the QT donuts 

My guy begrudgingly takes me here every couple of weeks for the donut stake out Its so worth it 

They get hard during the day so seriously  3AM or bust"
1,"My coworkers and I refer to this place as Pizza n Ants  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands right after using the till  Also as the nickname suggests there has been a noticable insect problem 



As if that could all be overlooked the pizza isnt even good  If you are in this part of town go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead"
5,My daughter and I really love it here  I always walk in without an appointment and I never have to wait more than a few minutes  The staff is very friendly talented and professional  Highly recommended
5,"I am giving Ajo Als on Shae five stars because Ive been there regularly for about two years and its always good Now let me point out two issues Im not a huge fan of Mexican food and I only get the Tacos Del Mar or Ono Fajitas which are versions of the same thing The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa more peppery and hot For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty For a friend and I this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly Try it

Detail

Like I said Im not exactly a fan of Mexican food I like the Americanized fastish food chains Qdoba Chipotle even Baja Fresh Ive eaten at actual Mexican restaurants in Mexico and had home cooked Mexican fish tacos and tamales Its growing on me but these are not tastes I grew up with

I have a friend who loves Ajo Als she lived next to it or something So I pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and I liked it right away Like I said Ive only really eaten the fish tacos but theyre the best Ive had The fish is good the sides are good idk what chipotle cream is but its good good service the chip lady is nice all the wait staff have been good

Its typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full Ive never waited to be seated though Ive never tried the bar area The water seams better than tap watera dumb observation but I usually drink water rather than soda so I mention that They give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed The chips and salsa are endless and excellent Service is always good

Two friends typically get the Pollo Con Queso and swear its the best ever Ive had it as leftovers and its good but not really my thing

This is the only Ajo Als Ive been tono comment on the rest of this chain"
1,No no nodo not go here now Im not talking about the fact that the place looks crappy or the bathroom is suspect but the fact that the food is nasty It was completely empty when we were there and that should have been some indication on what to expect but no I am a glutten for punishment I ordered some tacos and didnt even finish the meal I ended up just tossing the food and still got a tummy ache from what little I did eat This place is definitely not a good look
5,"Wow Chill rocks Frank and his lovely wife the proprietors are fantastic The prices are super low and the gelatosorbet is awesome While we were there a little kid dropped the top part of his cone on the ground Frank replaced it for free 

Then he gave us a sample of the fatfree sugarfree chocolate sorbet which made me want to buy a pint of it after I had already eaten a baby sized MangoPomegranate mix Yum 

How about this Go have dinnerlunchbreakfastwhatever at Pita Jungle then walk across the parking lot to Chill for dessert That sounds like the perfect evening"
5,"Ok technically this is not Mexican food its spanish and puerto rican food but has a lot of the same kinds of spices and is WAY WAY WAY good

first off they have plaintains which look like bananas but taste like potatoes if youve never had them try them here yum this is definitely the place to go with a big group of peole and share a few different dishes good luck because the menu is HUGE the dessert menu alone has two dozen items

seafood like ceviche and paella supposed to be to die for tapas tamales soup salads egg dishes not breakfastthe list goes on and on and thats just lunch
plates top off around 12 for the most expensive for lunch but you can easily make a meal out of two apps
the mojito is their specialty and they have i think a dozen rums to choose from along with sangria on the last monday of the month every bottle of spanish wine is half off you cork it if you dont finish it i cant give this rest a more glowing recommendation"
5,"Durants ROCKS

I love the red velvet walls
I love walking through the kitchen to get to the restaurant
I love the garlicky cheesy bread that probably has a million calories in it
I love the steaks
I love the decor
I love the bar

We all ordered different items when we went here for dinner one night and all raved about what we had  I dont think you can go wrong no matter what you order  Its amazing delicious and very very unique"
1,"I had the misfortune of stopping by this establishment today with two things a skirt and a cloth handbag I asked the woman at the counter if I could have some very minor stitching done on a cloth purse She looked it over for about 3 seconds and said Oh no I dont see how this could be repaired what I wanted sewn were two little pom poms attached to the cloth strap that were loose and I wanted them to be stitched on there tighter Not a difficult task She then told me that she could maybe send it out and have it stitched but it would take a week or more to get it back WHAT
I then asked her about  the skirt which I wanted cleaned andor pressed with the tags attached because Im selling it She said no that the tags would be destroyed in the process 
So I went to another dry cleaners and asked the same things for both the skirt and the bag I was informed that what I wanted done would be no problem and that I could pick it up the next day"
5,I love this place The Las Vegas roll is amazing however the crispy California roll isnt that crispy Their sake is in fact bomb and the restaurant it always a good time Their prices are reasonable for sushi places in Tempe and the service has always been awesome If youve got a party bigger than 4 though call ahead
5,Some of the best coffee Ive ever had  and I lived in Portland Insanely good selection  product Tanzanian peaberry off the charts Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best
5,One of my most favorite coffee shops Location for sure Soooo cute here Inside and out The patio is beautiful and you feel like youre in a diff city for a moment Coffee is pretty darn good Not the best but good And the menu is great I am a vegetarian and they have many options for us The treats are amazing The staff is amazing And they always seem to play great music too Love this place Wish it were not so far away in Mesa
5,I love this restaurant Very cheap very clean the food is sooo good My mom and I eat there once every couple of weeks sometimes twice once a week The staff is very friendly and attentive The environment is very comforting I recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty Mexican food
5,"Im giving this Office Max five stars for convenience friendly service competitively priced products a stocked shelves 

This Office Max is a great in and out shop On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side there is a complete copy center Its open until 9 on the weekdays and they dont make you feel rushed if you get there at oh lets say850 In fact they are helpful They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed The copy center staff was also very friendly 

This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here 

So on that note I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings"
5,Tasty Thai is But it could also be called Delicious Thai And the service is always great
5,"If this place only served chips and their salsa bar I would still give it 5 stars  As a salsa and hot sauce theyre different people fanatic I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa  and La Condesa ranks high  Last time I was there I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments limes onions etc  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa to spicy chipotle or creamy cilantro  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table but you have to try them all 

The horchata here is also 5star material  Dont be a cheapskate  shell out the 4 for it Its giant it will make you happy And when youre done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts  the drink keeps on giving 

I have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious  I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans which seem a bit bland to me  But the tacos salsa and drinks all make up for some plain ol rice 

I was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license  This place needs to stick around for awhile"
5,"Tarbells is top notch in all areas  Food quality service ambience amazing  I recently took ten business associates there for a meeting and I got nothing but compliments the next day on such an excellent choice of restaurant  

Definitely try the Spaghetti  Meatballs as well as the Mac N Cheese and even the Pizzas are to die for  And the burger too  You really cant go wrong here  Warning the deserts here are HUGE yet amazing  One desert is enough for 23 people"
5,"Amazing cheesesteak

One mile from my home is Corleones About 1520 minutes from my home is Capriottis I never go to Corleones I go to Capriottis all the time

The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific The large is 20 I believe so if youre ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke get the medium Also try it with the hot peppers It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming

Thats really all I can say about this place Wonderful cheesesteak I havent tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there The patrons rave about the other sandwiches though so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else Theres maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dinein lunchdinner hours

Do yourself a favor and go to Capriottis Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves The fact that theres only 8 reviews is criminal I understand it is in the heart of the suburbs but its worth the drive"
5,I have been exploring more of the park recently  I want to add that the National Trail which is almost 15 miles long and goes from one end to the other is a real gem  The views on this trail are outstanding and on the western half you will find far fewer people than on the eastern half  Highly recommended
5,I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis ripped tendons in the foot I was not getting enough massage to make much progress I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing  They had the right touch pressure and listened to what I needed   Going back for more
5,"Recently bought a house and had issues with the speed and interference with the very many wifi networks around me
I decided to go wired so after I did a lot of research on how to get a wire from my second floor to first floor for the entertainment center I bought a lot of tools from Frys electronics and then after I started actually looking at what I had to do I realized it would not be something I can do myself

I called good guys electric and they came over and ran a couple of wires using CAT6 instead of the CAT5 I would have used through the nailridden attic and through walls without any wires sticking out while they kept away from the electrical wires to prevent interference

I returned the tools and wire I got from Frys electronics and that made the install very affordable

Im very happy with the quality of my network speed now being able to stream HD content from my server upstairs to the TV 200 feet away

After completing the networkwiring job I had them install a new chandelier on a remotecontrolled dimmer switch which was done quickly and works great"
5,Been here twice First time to fix a broken window regulator and the second time to get a checkup All the techs have been extremely honest and Ive never felt taken advantage of I spent over a grand on updates to my car there and I couldve spent more but again theyre honest and didnt pressure me to do everything that they said Its family owned  run theyre originally from the bay area so of course Ive got a soft spot If you have car problems need a check up or need a second opinion they wont steer you wrong pun intended
5,This is like a little sanctuary on the West Side with a few amazing therapists The LMTs are pretty different from each other so ask some questions before you book It is so awesome to walk in and be addressed by name and with a smile The owner is seriously the nicest lady Ive seen running a business in a long time
5,"Japanese chefs top notch sashimi affordable neighborhood sushi place 55

Id lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo If you go to Hiro you have to order their sashimi We always order scallops sashimi yellow tail salmon toro sashimi and uni sea urchin Their rolls are amazing too All sashimi comes in a bigfatlap portion Very fresh The service is great too"
5,"I couldnt wait to get home and yelp this place Five stars too 
After a raw chicken bad experience some 13 years ago I hadnt been to Bandera until tonight WOW It was a GREAT experience 
We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous 
Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw not your ordinary cole slaw and the most delish matchstick fries 
Unfortunately I dont eat seeds and nuts peanuts in the cole slawmy husband loved it but the very polite and wonderful server Sarah offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to diefor delish Home made wonderful braised red cabbage 
The entire meal was SUPERB The service was phenomenal and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come outthey all looked YUMMY 
I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Banderas ribs and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship Everyone is polished polite and efficient The food is an experience in perfection and the service tip top
Next time Ill take some pictures if Im not too hungry 
I dont think its a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressycasual type of place if you know what I mean
REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD"
5,"Located in the space formerly occupied by LGOs short lived Radio Milano the north side of Campbell has been reincarnated as the Arcadia Room a private dining facility operated by the aforementioned restaurant group

I dined here recently for the hubbys work dinner Unlike so many private facilites that feel like a corporate conference room the Arcadia Room is a cool casual restaurant  all to your self

We had about 60 in our group and had plenty of room to mingle at the sleek bar lining one side of the room or gather by the open kitchenThe weather was blazing hot when we were there but there is even a lovely little patio outdoors for guests

I think this would be an ideal location for any work or social occasion where you want an intimate atmosphere combined with reputable fare"
5,I love Tasty Kabob  Their food is always excellent and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley  I always order their chicken shish kabob entree which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables  The chicken is always tender wellmarinated and equally wellseasoned  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor or just enjoy it as is  Its difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes but their hummus is always creamy and smooth and I love their shirazi salad  Their spicy beans dish however is by far my personal favorite and I always make sure to order it  Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit  The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome  Good food and service that makes you feel at home what more can you ask for  Simply put Tasty Kabob is one of the best
5,"Dim lighting Fleet Foxes Beautiful upstairs seating that almost seems secret Band of Horses Benches that are less cushy than you anticipate them to be The Shins Black board specials just because they look cool Beirut 13 vegetable dishes 

Intimidated yet Fight through the angst Once you take your first bite of food all the hullabaloo will be well worth it

Order the forbidden rice bowl Tell them to make it vegan the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter after all youre a pseudohipster for the evening and its fantastic If youre depressed by the idea of black rice as your main carbohydrate the flat breads are tastegasmic That crust the things Id do for unlimited amounts of that flat bread crust Top it off with figs and ricotta and theres no way Im passing up a square or two or seven If youre still not sold on the idea of carbloading the salmon superfood is delicious and nutritious and whos not into a little superfoodiority now and then

But on to the main event the chocolate stout cake  spiced ice cream  espresso ganache was the best chocolate cake Ive ever had It was just so damn moist There I said it Moist Moist Moist Ew But really yum If caffeine chocolate and alcohol dont suit your fancy wimp the cheesecake in a jar was equally delightful Cookie crust  strawberry compote  cream  cheesecake Layered In a jar Who thought of that Someone with adorable thoughts thats who 

And lets be honest youve earned dessert I mean you ordered a healthy vegan entree over the french onion cheeseburger right Right Of course you did"
5,Yes it is a biker bar  And it is packed with them at certain times especially weekends  I dont ride But if you roll in on a weekday around noon you might not see any and if everyone seems to know everyone its because they are all friendly local folks So if youre visiting Cave Creek dont assume the Hells Angels are there looking to kick ass   Most of the bikers probably drive BMWs during the week  I stop in at least once a week for a bite  The food is the best bar food in Cave Creek and the service is awesome Ive been to every bar in town Harolds  The Chip Toad etc all are good but The Hideaway is the best
1,"Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago Unfortunately for them I also sampled Ollie Cakes No wonder Ollie Cakes aka Urban Cookie won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake

Drive a few miles north get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldnt know yummy if it bit them on the butt

Really the TC cakes were just cakes No flavor no texture dry And I cant say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one tiny flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing As their products now do at least to me"
1,"Just because this place is called Maria Maria doesnt mean they sell Mexican food Their menu actually says Mexican inspired cuisine which should have been my clue to leave The food is border line Nasty  

The restaurant is cute and sort of romantic but its so loud in there that it ruins the romantic mood I was excited to see they had live music until they started playing some weird pop music Why would they do that in a Mexican restaurant  I wanted to leave but our waitress was no where to be found 20minutes after we finished our meal

I dont recommend this place for any meal  

I have only been living in Scottsdale for two months but it seem that Arizona is Cougar town The bar was full of them Im beyond annoyed with all this ladies acting like they are 21 wherever I go Im embarrassed for them They dress and act young but with that face and hands who are they kidding besides themselves gee"
1,I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon I ordered a salad to go As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didnt I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow Very disappointed 6 bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website I wont be returning here Ill be passing on lunch next time the coworkers opt for this place
5,"RT OSullivans really hit the spot The service and the atmosphere were outstanding We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 45 plus The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized The food was wonderful 

We will be going back"
5,I have been going to Nails 101 for a long time and I love them I had a manicure done there about a month ago and it lasted for 8 days without chipping Love Nails 101
5,I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey melty fake cheese  Also they have frings a combo of fries and onion rings  Very tasty
5,"The food is fantastic the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable 

The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix regardless of price The cheese is amazing 

I love their flour tortilla flautas  crispy beef tacos cheese crisps enchiladas I could go on and on 

I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food 

I highly recommend El Bravo"
5,"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE 

Even with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies the service at our large table was spot on We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us our drink orders were taken    and one quick blink of the eye and the peacemakers were before us  

Now thats what I call HAPPY HOUR

Bravo Thirsty Lion"
1,What  The   Heck     Be prepared for sticker shock  I walked in through the store and made a hasty straight line back to exit  And over and across the road to Crate  Barrel   Ahhhhhh  much better  Whew
5,"This review has been waiting and waiting for me to get it out there so here goes

Baiz market reminds me of Chicago There are so many great Middle Eastern markets back there that I felt spoiled when I came to Phoenix and didnt know of many If you think of Lee Lee as the goto spot for all of your Asian cooking needs then Baiz is the place to go to for all of your Middle Eastern cooking needs And with Al Hana check out my review for that too right inside to satiate your hunger Baiz is numero uno in my book 

This place is fantastic the food is fantastic the prices are fantastic and being able to grab all the ingredients I need to make homemade baba ganoush while snacking on an amazing kufta sandwich is pretty okay too "
5,I recently stayed at the Sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in Phoenix I was blown away by the services This is by far the best service I have received while staying at a hotel in recent years I received a room on the 15 floor Room was what you expect from Sheraton The view from the room really sucked I got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers TV quality was good and room had Starbucks coffee Room also came with a refrigerator I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar The desserts are yummy I didnt get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street My work colleague used the gym He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need Next time I would definitely stay here again
5,"This place is still open but the name has been changed to Juba and it is under new ownership Same spot though and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu 

Anyway I absolutely love coming here My friend Molly is one of the servers and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine Its definitely a very interesting blend of flavors but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel The coffee drinks are delicious too and since theyre made with Ethiopian coffee the taste is very unique 

If youve been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food just get over it and go try the food at Juba You wont be disappointed"
5,"I want to preface this review by saying that Im close friends with one of the sushi chefs in training so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat  That being said I will review this strictly on the quality of food since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests  Cmon now you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staffchefs so quit your whinin

The quality of the fish was excellent some of the best sushi Ive had in my existence  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef and ask them what is fresh and what they would suggest omakase style  

We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin yellow tail otoro yes the good stuff and a few other pieces  Served with fresh wasabi root not the hydrated green powdery stuff this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses

We had a few different rolls per the chefs suggestion and all were spectacular including some off the menu rolls  The kim bap roll was highly recommended and the quality was definitely memorable better than most Koreanmom kim bop rolls Ive had in my life

We asked for amaebi sweet shrimp which was soft tender and sweet with perfectly fried shrimp head to back  This was the first time Ive had such perfectly made amaebi and its made me want to continue my search in Chicago

Some tasty mochi desserts a few bottle of sake and all in all it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I  

Im sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues but as a sushi fanatic my advice to you is this

1  Dont ask for a table if youre party is smaller than 4 ask for a spot at the sushi counter because thats how sushi is meant to be served  Getting to know your chef the chef getting to know you having drinks together etc  

2  Ask the chef what heshe recommends  Not all fish are equally fresh and the chef will know whats best for the day  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you likeddidnt like theyll likely craft a sushi experience for you that youll love

Verdict  If only Otaku were in Chicago I might go broke  Delicious sushi and worth a visit"
1,"Rental car review

118 degrees  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses  Finally a bus  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside  5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminal

PHXpay attention  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by"
1,Every time Ive been there they have messed up my order in some way The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers they were both snickers Very upset I havent been back and I love that place
5,"Stayed here one night while traveling to Phoenix for business  What a cool hotel  Ive never stayed anywhere like this

I didnt experience the 50s personally but this place has really kept and captured that essence  And yes its been renovated  This place was built in the 50s but its not run down or anything like that

The room was nice the pool looked great never got to go the service was impeccable the food at Zuzu was very good  Old town Scottsdale is right around the corner with great restaurants and bars  Whats not to like"
5,This place is so great I am a nanny and had to bring in a dance outfit to get the straps shorten for the girl I care for The woman did this for no charge It was only the second time I went there She said it would only take her two minutes so no charge She was super sweet
1,Waste of time I could not even get in there today because there was a football game The wanted me to pay 10 just to park How stupid is that 2 days before Christmas I noticed all the prices were the same and somtimes more than any other mall Goobye and good riddens I have better things to do with my time and money
5,"How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location  I honestly dont understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business  given everything is practically free My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me like a little pie or turnover flan for him a dozen tortillas and 2 red burritos  I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday  

The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it  I had lemon and cherry but I wanted to try one of everything  The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful  Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldnt wait to get home to devour mine  They could double their prices and I would still come back

I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to"
5,"Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like Totally reminds me of LA SF or any authentic Pho place in any multicultural city Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck must give thanks to center city

Anyhow portions are large ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive If youre one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall"
5,Love love LOVE this place  Eugenia is a genius  Macarons  amazing  Croissants  soft buttery flaky delicious goodness  Iced mocha is one of the best I have ever had  My only complaint is that this place is not closer to my house or work but thats probably a good thing because I would weigh 1000 lbs if it was
1,"F724 

She didnt even look at me didnt bother asking why I was entering her place of business didnt reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence Just handed me a ticket and was done with me If this happened anywhere else I would make an effort to never return tell all my friends how horrible this experience was and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business Sadly this was my Saturday morning at the DMV a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell With the same musac score playingand the same voracious stench in the airand the same spastic children running around only in my version of Hell its politicians campaigning around me 

So I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays they gave me a map How precious I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday Seriously Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley After receiving such a magnificent welcome I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life To simplify what was so bad let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public 

1 Bathe The combination of water and soap along with massaging the skin creates an outcome that is most pleasing Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot  httpwwwcraigslistorgaboutbesthtf755891987html 

2 Sit still Yes I know were all waiting here for about an hour But tapping your foot rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg arent going to make time go any faster Trust me I was watching the clock If you feel anxious get up and walk around 

3 Leash your children If they cannot sit quietly leave them in the car Its winter theyll be fine Its not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers Its even more not cute when he fakefalls five times in a row right in front of me 

4 Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when takingmaking calls To the lady behind me Im sorry youre not that experienced in stripping The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl Thanks to your continued conversation I was able to figure out you were a woodworker 

5 Acknowledge the humans around you Yeah I get it Im not that big In fact if I turn sideways I disappear But Im still right in front of you so pay attention quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg Unless that was flirting in which case you really need to find someone more your level 

Oh the DMV You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brothers old gym shoes and my dads dirty underwear There has to be an award for that but I dont have the motivation to research it 

Oh and F724 was my number upon entering I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper Just so you know that one star is for the website which should probably get 34 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship

5,"What a great surprise stumbling across this bank  Open 7 days a week with lobby service

I have banked with the Mega Uber Banks and have been nickeled and dimed literally with service fees

I opened both a savings and checking account here  Since my company does not offer direct deposit the associate told me I would have to have a traditional checking account with service fees  Im thinking  here we go again  But it was one of those think on your feet moments  Off they went Ill assume to get approval   They let me open up a type of checking account that only charges you for check printing  No other fees and pays interest  In fact if you use a nonMidFirst Bank ATM they will refund you the service fees  How refreshing with the current state of banking"

1,So I had this important event to attend in California and Ive already spent a lot of money preparing for my trip Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for 40 off any service at Epic salon Wow that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice I just needed a tint touchup about 1 so I went to this salon I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town but I couldnt pass up the savings by using the 40 coupon  I was secondguessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved Again though the coupon lured me in Anyway I walked away with the worst experience ever Not only was my color wrong  I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1 outgrowth to a 3 ash when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it 5min later the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair which did not help at all  The style sucked too I just left I did not have time to see if they could fix it again I will not be going back to this place for any services Noy only because the hair experience was bad but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness UGH I will give this place 1 star only because on the coupon was also a savings of 30 off products
5,"Visiting a friend who insisted we come to Carolinas on my first morning in town to get a breakfast burrito To Die For

She was totally spoton

These delicious handmade tortillas are fantastic  I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me but since theyre freshlymade Im guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality

I enjoyed the chorizo egg and potato burrito with plenty of salsa  I loved the spicysmooth combo with the sour cream in the burrito

I hope I get a chance to eat here again before leaving town"
5,"Ive passed by prestige nails in walmart 100s of times but never really thought of having a pedicure there even though they are always busy As I stared at my feet long overdue for a pedicure I thought it was about time to try themsince walmart rarely lets me down why should the nail salon inside

To my surprise I got a wonderful pedicure or 23 not too bad this day in agemy to mention it was just as good as going to the more upscale salon just across the street 

Im glad to be the first to review them they deserve it Now if only they did facials at walmart and hair Id be set"

5,"I would typically never write a review for strbucks because it is all the same  I mean that in the best possible way as i have come to expct a certain level of service and quality  Starbucks is amazing for kids as my dzughter oly drinks warm milk and so anywhere i see a starbucks i can ge a kids milk  I have had  great serive at this location  Since i could not find the starbucks at the asu bookstore location i am using this review too but really the five stars is for this location I wanted to give the asu location one star  My barista NOEl today was exceptionaaly rude She did not know how to make nor ring up a kids drink and when it  came up wrong instead of offering to fix it told me that  is how it is done  If my other experiences weren t so good with starbucks i would have switched over to petes  If you happen to be the starbucks manager at the asu bookstore location too NOEL definitely could use some more training in both drink preparation and customer service

Sorry for the spelling areas but i am typing on my iphone and havent found the pellchck option yet"
5,The place was just your typical stable but my wife and I had a wonderful experience here It was our first time riding so the staff took great care to show us how to mount and maneuver the horses We then followed a guide through an orchard for an hours ride just the right length of time for us as beginners The horses were very tame and were easy to ride The best part of the experience however was our interaction with the staff They couldnt have been more friendly and more helpful Were excited to go back
5,"As a sissy vegetarian I feel compelled to mention the soup that no one has yet mentioned at Da Vang  THE TAMARIND BASED SOUP HOT POT IS AMAZING

I dont know if they use any other animal broth in it because I am willfully ignorant of such matters  Regardless if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian try the tamarind soup and bring friends  It is super yummy

They also have a ricebased soup  And if you talk to your server they can likely recommend some vegetariantofu based dishes that will be wonderful

Everything else is as good as everyone says it is  Wouldnt be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of subpar pho every family restaurant makes mistakes  Id recommend everyone try it again"
1,"One of the WORST experiences of my life  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it  So the day we decide to go the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also  We go in and we thought hey wow this is kinda cool as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard  However once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad all of them had cottage cheese legs and thighs  We sat down and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger his meal would be on the house  He kills it and when we ask why his burger wasnt free we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us you either pay or i come over the counter he threatened us with violence which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us  We will never ever go there again  Being Asian he also spewed racial slurs at us calling us to go back to where we came from  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I dont know where we would go  Anyways dont go here  

Also all of the patrons ALL of them were middle aged men who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant whos burgers arent even really grilled  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through so you cant even want a medium burger they are all torched  The fries although fried in lard are crap  All in all if youre a lonely loser this is the place for you  If youre a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied"
5,I totally agree with LCs review  Going to XCP made college seem like a breeze  Yes there were the typical high school dramatics but I feel like the teachers were able to take a harder line on discipline since they werent in fear of getting in hot water with the public school district  I had an overall great experience here and I love meeting people all over the country that have gone to Xavier  My last flight home the person in the seat next to me went there and we had tons of peoplethings to chat about  Its fun to see where everyone has ended up and it is fun to get together with fellow alums for drinks here in Chicago and when I am back home in AZ  I think it is so sad that the girls dont get to do freshman swimming sophomore dances or go to dockers anymore  those were some defining moments of my XCP career  I dont know much about other private schools cropping up in the growing valley but if I had kids they would be headed to Xavier and Brophy
5,"Ive been going here for 10 years My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe I needed everything quickly and was very specific She got everything done in time for my trip 

Over the years Ive brought dozens of clothes Shes done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress Shes hemmed and taken in Shes shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look I can communicate anything I want and shell have it done exactly the way I envisioned it Weve been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks 

Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality Every single person Ive recommended has been extremely pleased with her work"
1,"I wish I could give this location a big fat ZERO

But you cant  But I can let everyone know how horrible it is

For starters their automatic doors do not even work  I just find that appalling  How can your doors not work on your store  How are people supposed to get in there to shop

The manager of this location is nothing more than a jerk  I asked for help and all I received was attitude

For a struggling supermarket that filed for bankruptcy I would think service would be one thing you could promote at no cost  But not here

I dont think it will be long before this location closes  RIP"
1,"YUUKK

That pretty much describes this place  We went there on Sunday afternoon for lunch  Only 1 person in line in front of us  I ordered the 2 meat combo rib tips and hot linkssides of mac  cheese and potato salad   

it took about 40 mins to get my food  But I told myself if it was goodthen its worth the wait  But by God it wasnt good at all  The mac  cheese had no flavor at alli mean none  The potato salad was very flavorless as well  The rib tips would have been good if they werent covered in 5 gallons of bbq sauce nasty bbq sauce at that  Their sauce is like a sweet and sour saucewas not good at all  The hot links were mixed in with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce  So couldnt tell if they were any good cause there was so much of that damn sauce

The funny part was that the couple that ordered right after me got their food and took it right back to the counter and straight out said that the food was just disgusting  I wish I would have done the same instead of spending 15 on nasty bbq

In short  I will not be going back here"
5,Cant say enough about this place We were amazed by the room and its stylings and even more amazed with the pool and the view from it We were on a mission to chill and found the perfect place Views of Camelback Mountain and a staff that knew what they were doing Try the brie quesadillas and the Sanctuary lemonade
5,Always a marvelous experience The patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting The menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff The cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines The food is always very good and also unique  rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here I have been there for Valentines Day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special It is pricey but worth every penny you pay
5,"I just stopped in tonight after the gym I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap

It was late 815 when I walked in 15 before close This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush It was empty and the lines were short

Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me"
5,This place is so good I have eaten almost everything on the menu It is not the fanciest of places but it is great to go with friends and buy a ton of delicious food for very little money I would recommend this place I go often
1,Ill start with the positive  They have some friendly members of staff  Thats it  You might catch a staff infection here so watch out  Its like a shack that somehow got a bar licence  I have a friend who drags me here on occasion as its his favourite dive  Its one wrong glance away from a fight every time  If you like the danger and excitement of drinking a beer in a building that may collapse on you go for it  If not avoid the dregs of society and go somewhere else
5,"The new location is big open and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mishmosh diner But thats just aesthetics I realize

The food is great I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes Im not a huge fan of duck but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers mushrooms and ground pork if that helps you find it on the menu The drunken dragon is also fabulous and at 7 for lunch and 10 for dinner Yuphas a steal I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago Yum

I think its my favorite Thai in the greater campus area but then I thought about it and isnt most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area I think so 

Anyway Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell theyre trying hard with this grand opening A little asskissing is nice but then again places like these are for regulars so I guess they dont have to be overly nice to me Im just here to grub

EAT HERE And ask for twice the spicy you would normally The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium"
5,This place is too freaking cute  The OJ is literally one of the best glasses Ive ever had  I had the typical eggs bacon and toast and it was amazing  The bacon was crispy without being burnt the toast had just the right level of buttery goodness and the eggs were folded such as a crepe and fluffy goodness  I also tried a bite of the pulled pork burger which was amazing and the touch of apple put it over the top  Another plus was the garden patio area that feels homey like someones backyard  I will definitely be back to this cozy establishment
5,This is a great relaxing spot to stop for breakfast The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is something that will send you into the right mood to enjoy the rest of your day I wish there where more spots like this on the civic center park its such a great location
5,I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye I have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed My favorite is the RedChili Frybread with cheese added The service is excellent there You always get treated friendly and with a smile
1,Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years  The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch yuck
5,"Unfortunately my birthday always falls right around Mothers Day  Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed  We thought wed celebrate early by going on Saturday but it was still packed  We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM but the person on the phone said that if we just came down they would fit us in

So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami  These people think of everything And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive  The hostess heard me say something about my birthday which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing  

The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip which was soooo tasty  My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it  These are true professionals  Asparagus was cooked perfectly  The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy  And the dessert  Triple creme brulee  kahlua which tasted like a caucasian chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human

Yes its a little pricey but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish  Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal  The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded  If you are wierd about personal space this is probably not the place to go

Overall I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity"
5,"We were here on Wednesday 122111 We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed Not this time

Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional 

My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man it was huge and tasty

This is what Rubios is about"
5,This place is the best place Ive found so far for sushi in the Phoenix area  The wait staff is always attentive the sushi isnt overpriced and  their specialty sushis are actually good  They stick to the basics and dont veer too much into the west for their ideas  The plates and silverware are clean which is more than I was able to say at a different place Id tried  The sushi prices are similar to other places Ive seen  except you get 3 pieces not 2  They dont stick too much rice in the rolls  The pieces can sometimes push the limit but most are manageable  All in all this is a great place that I will come back to time and again
5,"This company is Awesome I was recommended to go here by a friend and was hesitant since it was my first time going to a salon I was extremely impressed with how welcoming they are and how dedicated they are to making your experience unforgettable They gave me a facial massage treatment thing that was out of this world The entire day I walked around with my face forward and could not stop talking about how great I felt I will be visiting quite often Thank you so much

5,This place does it right but hold on to your walet U have to try the Yellow butter cake its over the top
5,Amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings  Wine and booze selections are great too  Killer store like candyland for adults  Prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something  Great place
5,Just have to rave about Becca and Todds Zoo tour on a Segway It was the highlight of our trip to Scottsdale  I had never been on a Segway before but it was so easy and Becca taught me all the tricks  We never would have visited the Phoenix Zoo if it was not for the Segway tour  It was fun easy and worth every penny
1,Absolutely disgusting  I had enchiladas and a taco just to give them a chance  This was the worst mexican food Ive ever had  Waaaaaay too much government tasting cheese on the food and hardly any meat  I do have really high standards because I grew up on TexMex but this was just pathetic
5,Fabulous This was my son in laws Restaurant Week choice and an excellent one Lots of menu choices a drink included and excellent service from the moment we arrived until we left We will return soon and often
5,"Oh Rhythm Room how I adore thee

I have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed   Whenever The Rhythm Room Allstars play I definitely try to make it  They are rockin  

I dig the dancing the bbq mmmmmm  and I enjoy when the fck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floor

I do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open get in line get a table then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start  

I always have a great time here  And now that you cant smoke its even better"
5,"Very good place for breakfast  lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th  Camelback  I kinda found this place on accident  I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylors and being closer I opted to go there instead  

Taylors is open 64ish I couldnt really tell they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door and they serve breakfast all day well all day theyre actually open which is always good with me  

I was in the mood for corned beef and  bingo there it was  Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese no saurkraut or thousand island please  And the bread oh the bread grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside  How in the hell do they do it  I dont know but Im in love"
5,Man oh Man   Since leaving New York six and a half years ago I have been in search of good Chinese Food  I had gotten to the point where I would have even settled for decent  A work colleague suggested that we dine here on the way to a corporate meeting  While I realized that he was a native to the Phoenix Metro Area and had probably never even had the real thing I trusted his palate and restaurant sense  I was so pleased when we walked in and saw that the diners were predominately Asian  I knew that  a great  Asian market was next door as well and these things were the first things that signaled to me that I was probably going to get good food  I was thrilled to see familiar Dim Sum carts rolling through  We were a party of 7 and shared around  The food was fantastic  Dim sum was fresh and succulent  Our orders from the menu were equally delicious  The veggies were fresh and brightly colored  The tastes distinctive and delicious  The Hot and Sour Soup was perfect filled with all kinds of Chinese mushrooms etc  I was delighted and reminisced about the many fantastic dinners in Chinatown NY This food was comparable  I do not live close by but I will be a regular there  Chandler is clear on the other side of the World from me but I figure if Marco Polo could do it so can I  Phoenix Palace is the REAL Thing  Friendly prompt service rounded out the experience  Hooray for Phoenix Palace
1,We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price  However we went back a few weeks ago and boy were we disappointed  The price of the fish and chip dinner went up and they cut the portion in half  No one assisted us in putting two tables together we had to do it ourselves  Two guests wanted a good English hot tea and they didnt brew it in advance it was just thrown into a small metal tea pot and we had to ask for cream and sugar  So weve decided there are newer and better places to eat fish and chips especially up in north Phoenix
1,"My rating is based on the fact that as a vegetarian they charge 8 for a small mediocre bean burrito  Maybe if this bean burrito were exceptionally good or large in size but it was neither  Im not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less  

GRINGOS  Take off the Chipolte blindfolds  Go to a real Mexican restaurant and see what real food is supposed to taste like"
1,This place has gone so downhill If I hadnt gotten my chips salsa  water immediately I wouldve walked out Margaritas are always awesome But the service and food is straight up AWFUL Microwaved enchiladas no rice rude cold unfriendly uninviting serviceIf youre looking for a fabulous neighborhood mexican restaurant try Las Glorias Grill The location isnt as great but the food service and drinks blows this place outta the water After years of going to aunt chiladas Im NEVER going back again They dont deserve your money either
5,First time here new favorite You can create your own antipasti plate and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had Service was good Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful Monkey bread is also stellar I cannot wait to go back
5,"This little spot in the art district of Scottsdale is as good a lunch restaurant as Ive been to  I had the mahi mahi tacos and was blown away by the attention to detail in the flavors bringing the dish together as well as the wonderfully tasteful presentation  

Of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses about which I dont have sufficient words to do justice  Both my father and I were hard pressed not to buy a condo in Scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view  They were dressed tastefully not in the slightest bit slutty but holy god"
5,I have been frequenting this spot since they opened and have always said they were better than Starbucks but Iam in a special kind of heaven after the change in menu and addition of pressed tea lattes Yum yum yum Far better than Starbucks powdered green tea latte and roughly a dollar cheaper than the high priced cup there as well The early morning staff is great and free WiFi is an added bonus I can honestly say for the New Year Im quitting you Starbucksand mean it
1,Im never shopping here I dont wanna shop somewhere where associates think if u can afford it in just goona purchase the bag online then looked at if I could afford it
5,"I have totally fallen in love at Tuck Shop  Everything here is fantastic  My friend and I come here about twice a month and enjoy some snacks and wine  The beer battered Cheese Curds may just change your life for the better we are seriously tempted to each get our own order 

I am not very good at sharing and i always get what I want   No im not an only child well maybe I was until i was 11 how did you know  WAH   

Oh and Laura is fantastic  She always takes great care of us as we enjoy a glass of wine on the couch in the reading room  

Thursdays special is meat loaf dont deny yourself just indulge  "
1,"Your reviews are hilarious   shootwho was this referring to

I try to avoid WM  Im always warned about the possibility of TB or now pig flu  I think the hub just doesnt want to go shoppingnot that I LIKE shopping

I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees  Ive spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses  Hes a minority I guess bc as you all said YOU CANT FIND ANYTHING and CANT GET HELP without attitude usually  

Im standing there staring at 2 mgrs and they just ignore me for a few minutes  I didnt want to interrupt the conversation so I waited  FINALLY one asks if I need help  NAAAAAH I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way  FOOLS  

On my last visit a customer said excuse me to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle  I glanced at her and she sighed rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her  I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration  Then one employee pipes up with OH Im sorry maam can we help you  She asks to find an item the customer thanks them they say Youre welcome the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other THATS WHAT WERE HERE FOR  NO THATS NOT WHY WERE HERE  Were not here to find stuff for stupid people we have better things to do    Thats why when I walk by an employee working if they lay eyes on me they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job to avoid stopping to help  WT  Whats wrong wthis management  

I agree you can find some deals and save some money but the attitude is over the top  There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly at least when I see them and I can point them out  If not for the more often than not occurences as mentioned above I stay OUT of WM as much as possible which is a lot  Ive drastically reduced my trips there but more importantly Ive cut out a huge chunk of purchasing from WM"
5,"I am one step closer to completing my goal  I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die  After tonights visit to this one I have most of AZ taken care of

We decided to come here because we had never been to this one  We arrived and were seated right away  Surprisingly this one wasnt crowded at all and that was fine by us  

We got a small caesar salad a small pepperoni and garlic and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers  A few minutes later we got our salad  It was really good  Just enough dressing lots of cheese and croutons  It was a good starter  A few minutes after that our pizza came out  If you have read my other reviews you will know that I think Grimaldis is the bestthis pizza was no different  I really liked the white with roasted red peppers  Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas I turned on my inner fat boy and finished off all the pizza  It was tough but someone had to do itlittle kids are starving in Africa somewherelll be damned if Im going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza  Down the hatch it wentmy stomach doesnt like me right now because its so full but he will forgive me once he doesnt get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL"
5,"As good as I always remember it to be
Their fries are way better than InnOut I am a fries connoisseur

Their burgers may be getting smaller Still delicious as ever

I pass on the drink though an extra 2 makes the meal quite expensive

Price 9 for the cheeseburger double and Regular fries
innout 6 for doubledouble and fries  half the size

I would eat here every day if I had the option"
1,This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 1520 min for me to pick it up I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced
1,"Great in its day now leaves a lot to be desired  Deserves credit as a Phoenix landmark Chinese restaurant  

This restaurant has been here for 38 years  Ive been going here off and on for 35 years  I go here more for sentimental reasons and not so much for the food  

The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago  The rest of the decorations have been torn out  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing  see the vaultoftheheavens style crenelations in the ceiling  

I have this restaurant  in its former self  to thank for this  Back in its day this restaurant was really great and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years 

Sadly the food here is not all that good  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old  The fried rice arrives looking almost black from the fryer oil  too much soy sauce instead of a rich golden brown and tastes overcooked somehow  The eggrolls are just OK  Definitely not fresh

A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu for example the special Chinese cakes served on a plate topped with a delicious gravylike brown sauce and shallots  probably some form of Cantonese food  All of this is gone and replaced by very plain fare and not very good at that  

If you like salty greasy plaintasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the 1perscoop variety then go here  Golden Phoenixs heyday as a great restaurant is longgone  Let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good  now passed on"
5,Love this place its on our dinner rotation The owners and wait staff always greet us since we are regulars Great place and cheap too Try the 100 its the best ever
1,I dont know whats up with Eddie I always found him to be pleasant and really taking care of the customers However on the 17th of November we had a birthday party of 19 people and they gave us one waitress We sat down at 700 pm and our main course came at 915 No real big deal but one person cant handle a table of 19 and we were having fun So one of the guests had ordered the 1200 burger along with a salad and told the waitress no Mayo because he cant stand it at all The burger comes out and it has Mayo on it and he tells the waitress She was not at fault and had written it down clearly He asked for a new one and she comes back and says Eddie cooked the hamburger and refused to cook a new one but would make him a new bun He didnt want that because he hates Mayo that much so there was no problem taking it off the tab but Eddie would not make a new one LOL Whats up Eddie I dont understand at all you take it off the bill because you screwed up but refuse to make another burger that you would have been paid for  Then you end up looking like a fool in front of the other eighteen people My daughter has even taken one of your classes and said what a great guy you are Really Really bad PR that night and the next birthday party wont be at Eddies House Great time that night but the ending leaves a very bad taste in 19 peoples mouth
5,"Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos an Ohio native fyi and considered by many to be the best patisseriebakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempes plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced not only does Essence not look like a college haunt neither do its prices or products  a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my servers accurate assessment that everything was really good

Now bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of premeal activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopouloss École Lenôtre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed  Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall Essences 3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of big things in small packages and particularly in its stillwarm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best Ive had stateside

Moving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essences Signature French Toast a 725 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be  the exterior crisp and the interior custardwhile the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread

At this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items Id bought for later my next two tastes were a pair of 295 macarons that much like the croissant rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palmsized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue  the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell

If there were any misstep on the morning it might have been the Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the FrenchEnglish take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries raspberries and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious

Moving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation the French Napoleon gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper MilleFeuille but also because so many premade versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the pastthankfully this was not the case at Essence  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess see Mille Feuille New York intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icons version was Id be hard pressed to say Essences was any less impressive  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy LArpege or Genin and given the names Ive dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essences proximity Ive no doubt Ill be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon"
5,"Im on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a communitywide service day We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd Kathy  the head of volunteer services  met with us and gave us a thorough introduction She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they takein and shelter animals She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics Did you know that over 7 years unneutered  cats can breed to reach 420000 in numbers and dogs 67000 thats CRAZY and so compelling 

Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities we saw dogs horses cats and bunnies It was very eyeopening First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter The animal accommodations are so impressive The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasnt as heartbroken as I thought Id be bc they really had nice size spaces 

There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park There are also private puppy rooms  The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean wo any odors 

The volunteers were so nice kind and devoted to the animals We got to feed horses play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there

It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them"
5,"Every time I go in this place its always a great experience  My wife and I have been going to Lucilles pretty much every other Sunday for the last couple months  Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles  If youre on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option  Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning

The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game  I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends  But make sure you get the fried pickles you will not be disappointed

Oh yeahplease please please order the Mac N Cheese as your side  You will thank me later

Q"
1,"How very disappointing  Nellos had a delightful menu with an array of salads pizzas and sandwiches Not Jacs If the new restaurant wants to be a pub it should have a wider variety of selections The menu was sad

Due to dietary restrictions I asked for a plain garden salad Lettuce tomatoes and onions And it wasnt very fresh either Sad

Guess well be driving up north to Pima Crossing to visit Nellos"
5,I highly reccomend this place They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here
5,"My absolute favorite coffee shop  Im a regular
Friendly atmosphere  staff buttery fluffy muffins ooey gooey danishes tasty coffee and support for local businesses and entrepreneurs  The only negative for me is the mysterious disappearance of the corn tortilla bagel much yummier than it sounds"
5,"Theres no business like show business As any of my friends will tell you I am a theater junkie I could sit in a theater all day all week all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent lol Well in actuality hmmmmmmm I really could I am not even joking on that I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again LOL  Ok seriously now Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons 
   My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are This is childrens theater at its best The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus The kids love it I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stageshow I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students Teehee   Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets 
   I have seen so many wonderful plays literature remakes and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay Fernidad BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors Debbie Scott Katie Jodi well all of them LOVE YOU
   Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools We have had an artist at our school for several years It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage  
   Of importance to note TCPA is a beautiful facility You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent What more can you ask for  
   The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in todays hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets A great way to start viewing them and get involved
    I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az As I have stated in my other ARTS reviews I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts Soooooooo as a famous circusrodeo person once said Go On With The Show"
1,"Great donuts but horrible service Didnt get anything we wanted due to a language barrier between us and the limited English speaking employee She claimed in broken English to only speak Spanish She understood ONLY the word dozen and we got a dozen of what ever she felt like giving us then proceeded to ignore us while using her cell phone
Donut shops are a dime a dozen and we will never again return to Bosa"
5,Great great food  Best meal I had all week in Scottsdale
5,"I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come and if youre in town and looking for a great local nonchain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should then try Cibo  

I took my man here for mystery date night as a surprise since he had never been  No wait at 845 on a Friday night yes take that Pizzeria B and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool  I love the atmosphere of the patio also lit with those great offwhite lights and fire pits  We shared the burrata which was gynormus easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us  The wine was tasty and reasonable  I was drinking a pinot grigio and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine  until I tried Cibos house version  It was very good definitely not from grandmas   Now for the pizza  it is just perfection  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust crispy on the outside chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings  It almost melts in your mouth its not heavy at all  Its nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella ricotta AND a scoop of ice cream on top  I dont typically die over dessert its my boyfriends thing  Im an app girl  but this it wasnt too sweet it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness  I would never eat here without dessert again  

I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour but they dont fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here  You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date  hell maybe even a mystery one "
1,So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware no condiments and no refills on the coffee I truly hope the restaurant retrains the staff or hires a whole new batch because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat
5,I am always comfortable in Michelinas the service is excellent and they are not rushing you to turn the table  Michelinas cooking is fantastic  Her daily specials are so inviting that I rarely order from the menu  The drinks are excellent bread just right and the after dinner complimentary cordial is a nice finish  One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix
5,"I am a hot dog lover 

For the past five years Ive found no greater joy in Phoenix than hitting up Nogales Dogs for the best meal on the planet Each evening when the Keyboard City on 20th St and Indian School closes the parking lot is converted into a quaint little dining atmosphere I most enjoy going around six the sun is setting and the buzz of traffic makes Phoenix seem more alive This is my own preference and I know many people who hate going at this time because of the loud traffic The bacon wrapped dogs are made to perfection with your choice of mayo beans tomatoes onions jalapenos cheese mushrooms and lettuce And to top it all off you can wash it down with a Mexican Coca Cola mmm so sugar filled Dont forget to bring cash and your appetite"
5,"Best Greek food I had in Arizona and excellent entertainment

The dolmas were the best Ive had their version of Babaganoush was very good and they had many lambbased dishes

The entertainment was great Live music belly dancing greekstyle fun broken plates and dancing

Since I had the sampler plate I can tell you that if youre vegan vegetarian or any other wacko thing like that you might not enjoy the food here Greek Lasagnareally Also the chicken was no good but I dont really like chicken anyway"
5,Clean organized and wellstocked for the most part Fujiyas carries my favorite car freshener chips bread and iced coffee in a can among many other good things Reasonably priced and extremely courteous customer service I am always happy to shop there The bentos I wish are kept in warmers like Suruki in San Mateo CA but Fujiya has an area adjacent to the register which includes a microwave to heat your purchased bento so you can sit and eat and relax after shopping What I love so much about their service is that I can place my order ahead of time and theyll have it available and ready I think this is the only Japanese store that has just about everything I need to stock my pantry Its no wonder Ive been coming here year after year
1,"Sorry Banana Leaf Im usually not picky at all but the Thai Curry Tofu and Vegetable dish I picked up last night was awful  Really it was almost not edible  The packaging was not great so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag  not a good start

Perhaps the curry is the yellow curry that Jenny R refers to in her review  maybe the chef should taste it before serving it  it was nasty

Seriously Ive had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before

I will say you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish  thank you but if someone requests eggplant perhaps you should make sure its cooked fully next time  I had a bite that was barely cooked  it was crunchy  

So needless to say  I dont think Ill be giving you another shot  First impressions sometimes last a lifetime  Sorry Banana Leaf"
1,I would absolutely not recommend living here I lived at these apartments for a year and wow was the management staff a MESS When I moved in my mailbox was broken so I couldnt get mail for a week They didnt give me a pool key they gave me the wrong apartment keys they would mix up all my information and they just werent very nice I cant remember how many times they lost my work orders so Id have to call and call to make sure things got fixed in my apartment The neighbors were loudI had to call the police maybe four times because they wouldnt turn down their music and I had to study for school and finals and random people came banging on the door looking for some girl who had obviously pd them off The police came to my house in the middle of the night looking for her too One time they gave my garage to somebody else even though I was still paying for it and when my husband came home in the evening with his pickup full of expensive equipment we had to wait for the cops to come and figure out whose car it was who was parked in our garage it was a total nightmare Shortly before I moved out new staff came in and they seemed somewhat better organized ButI wouldnt take the chance For the same price you can definitely find somewhere better to live
5,What a great find Located off of Yelp after a business meeting in the area  we were hungry before we hit the road Very comfortable space lighting is good so you can see each other  your food which is not always the case The decor is not overwhelming but extremely comfortable some TVs Thai decor  more pop music on the overhead The staff was extremely attentive from the moment we walked in through out the meal My Jasmin iced tea never got to the bottom The menu has great variety The pad Thai was excellent as were the vegetarian rolls The Tom Ka soup was excellent Every member of our group got something different and they were all extremely happy We will be back Pricing was very reasonable There is patio seating available Check it out
5,"Today was the fist time I have been to Chino Bandito My friend has been there several times and loves this place After having a few beers we were pretty hungry and decited to go here This place is mixed in a sort of industrial corner behind a Walgreens and a transmission shop Walking in you will notice how big this place is inside Customer service was excellent The counter person was great in explaining the different options on the menu which is a mix of Mexican food and Chinese food Great concept for something different For ten dollars I had the Carnitas burrito and a Jerk chicken burrito with Jerk fried rice and black beans and a large iced tea all you can drink It also comes with a Snikerdoodle cookie Wait time was minimal and the food was brought very quickly to our table I really enjoyed the items that I had order and I found the carnitas had the right flavor and tenderness in a burrito you can also get it in a bowl The Jerk chicken burrito had some zing to it Enough to make me sweat a little One thing that I noticed was that the employees were really good about keeping the place clean Sweeping cleaning the tables wiping up around the drink dispensers I also noticed that they wrap all of the highchair trays in plastic to keep the clean and dust free
One last thing they have free wifi"
5,"Too longit took me way too long to make it to Sens Sens is what we need more of in Phoenix

Seated promptly on a Friday night by Johnny Chu himself Johnny Chu really has put together a winner here Johnny Chualright I admit itI like saying his name

The Asian tapas idea is new to me having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas  but alas never an Asian tapas joint I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria

The Tofu dishes are amazing How do you learn to love Okra Get it at Sens The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts One taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor  fantastic

I will be back to Sens Tapas  Sake Bar soon  do you think you could invent an Asian Sangria Cmon Johnny I know you can do it"
5,Great home made taste on the meatballs  Also they have diet coke  Shop was nice and clean  Friendly and fast service
1,I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes two weeks although these fools canceled my financial aid I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time but this rep told me that the withdrawal period was Jan 11
5,What can I say except that Jodi is incredible I had purchased an online deal because Ive always wanted to do something like this and thought it to be a great gift for my other half I sent her a message and she quickly responded Almost everything I needed to know for the shoot was emailed to me You have the opportunity to do your own hair and makeup or have someone she works with do it at a reasonable rate I highly recommend that you get it done by her ladies That day I saw Erica She was really fun and got me into the mood the glass of wine helped too   and she did an incredible job with the makeup and hair For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you It really loosens you up a bit and allows you to be more comfortable It was perfect since my first photos were the nude shots Note wear loose fitting clothing nothing elastic and be sure that you do not have a sunburn on your body Let your hair air dry and it is OK to put on your own serums and moisturizers prior to the shoot Make sure nothing with sunscreen gets on your face and while its not necessary I made sure to use a primer I thought it really helped out with how my makeup set Be prepared to pose in positions that may be a bit awkward and also note that you will likely be sore the next day from the different twisting that you have to do Jodi really knows how to make you feel comfortable and at ease I dont make a habit of being in the buff in front of complete strangers and for me to drop my robe without feeling shy was a big deal for me It helped that I had my own music mix on my iPod throughout the entire shoot as well The overall whole experience was incredible I felt sexy and confident I went back with my honey to look at the photos He really really liked them and had a hard time choosing which he wanted to go into the album I cant wait to see everything finished I cant wait to do it again  Thank you Jodi for making it such a memorable experience I highly recommend her and her ladies
5,"The best burgers in Phoenix The owners are great and am on a first name basis Forget about fast food and support this local business 

Go double
Add bacon
Park at Circle K if in a hurry
Plan on holding it until you get home
Stick to the burger and fries genius"
1,"Im sorry to be what seems to be the lone one star review  Either I got there on the worst day in their history or everyone drank the Koolaid or I just have different expectations and taste buds
It seems like a great idea  Its a build your own burger joint 700 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese up to 4 toppings and 2 sauces with fries or onion ringsor some other choices  They also claim that the beef is local hormone free etcetera

I chose a rare burger with American grilled onions sauteed mushrooms tomato and lettuce with mayo and mustard on a potato bun  I added bacon for a dollar

First let me point out that if you are in a hurry DONT GO HERE TO EAT  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food This would not be a big deal if
1  I had been warned before they ran my credit cardwhat if I only had 30 minutes for lunch
2 They had places to sit but its tiny and full
3  They had magazines a jukebox ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes  You cant even get your drink early to sip on that

At the 30 minute mark Im ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better
Anyway before my burger comes up I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen  I look in the kitchenthey have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS   Hed better be getting a share of the profits  Now Im jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there

I finally get my burger  YAY  Im SO excited  All those 4 and 5 star reviews  I take a bite andthe patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon
WTH  I look at the patty  Its clean as a whistle I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket  The other side is clean too  The freakin burger was so greasy it slid all over the place  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out  Still not seeing any cheese mayo or mustard anywhere  Just oil  Tons and tons of oil  I open the bun  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by I am guessing a slice of cheese  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residueand more oil  Im grossed out but hungry  I take a bite  Its not rare  Its well done and oddly tastes very faintly of liver  BTW remember the bacon I paid a dollar for  Not there  Im really puzzled that instead of cheese or beef or SOMETHING I just taste that faint livery taste So I take another biteThere isnt even any salt or pepper or anything on the burger patty  This is perhaps the worst grade of meat available for human consumption  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town  Now I recognize the flavor  Im not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow but thats EXACTLY what it tasted like

At this point I turn to the fries  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like theyve been fried and then microwaved

I couldnt get out of there fast enough  Forget my danged dollar  just get me in the car

Exactly one hour and 20 minutes later I had vicious diarrhea

I havent had that trouble even with eating junk food at the fair

No  NO  A thousand times NO

Red Robin is my next burger stop  Period"
5,"So for my date tonight to the Compass Room I needed to get my nails done  I removed my acrylics myself last week  
I read the reviews here and decided to try DV
You know sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time its almost like the Soup Nazi  Not this place
There were two girls ahead of me so I waited a bit but only about ten minutes  
Its bigger than the place I had been going to  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs  That was nice  Yeah there were still speaking Vietnamese or so I think to each other yes probably about us gringas but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations
I had Le  She was so sweet  I told her all about my date too
She was quick and made some suggestions about what to get  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint  I was kinda short on time so I went with her suggestion of white tips  Plus it was about 5 cheaper
She was quick but really methodical  
I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics Ive gotten out here in the PHX
She even called me by name throughout the conversation
25 for a new full set  Not bad at all"
5,"Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food My search began with my iPhone for Pho AND I wanted good Pho Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert just sayin I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place worth it Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho but awesome I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood I couldnt finish it all but never can with Pho its a big bowl and filling 
Extras on tables to get your Pho on 
Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too left feeling not so stuffy AND full OH yeah and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day "
5,My wifes work had their Christmas party here last night Although the customer service was slow and average at best the food was outstanding I had a burger and my wife the steak salad I was the DD but my wife said the margaritas were excellent Dessert was tiramisu and sweet potato cheesecake Great little place with a nice vibrant ambiance
1,"Ok so I have to share my morning experience But first I must start off by saying this Im no moron Honest 

So this morning I stopped for gas My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way Id make it to work Thats okay for I allotted time this morning for refilling my tank From my casa I turned East on Indian School vaguely remembering theres a Quick Trip nearby Perfect I had stopped there before 

But it wasnt a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School Not wanting to risk running out of gas I opted to stop here at this ampm station 

I pulled up to the closest gas tank got out of my car took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle Only then I discovered there was no payatthepump option The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling Wow I thought Its so odd for a station to trust people  especially in this area  to not drive off without paying 

So I followed the instructions but nothing happened I kept hitting the grade button It kept beeping back at me Still nothing To top it off no pun intended the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle I had never seen anything like it 

Thinking my particular pump was fuct up I pulled my car up to the next one Thats when I saw it  this strange machine like an Amtrack ticket dispenser I approached with curiously Thats when I realized You swipe your card at this central machine or deposit cash if thats your preference and then go back to your pump Ahha This is how this station works So I did just that I punched in my gas pump number 4 and went back to my car to refill the tank Already annoyed at this point I figured Id pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days 

Only it wasnt pumping The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank UGH So thats when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out 12 worth of gas Then I rehooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt  it told me to do so when I swiped my card Only no receipt came out I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off 

Stupid ampm station Since when does any gas station benefit from being different Im so used to payatthepump you just swipe your card select your grade pump your gas grab your receipt and go Quick Trip doesnt torment me like this There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way Grr Screw this Im never going back there again

5,"Sauce is my kind of place  Great inexpensive food casual yet trendy atmosphere perfect location  

Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal  I always have the same thing the mozzarella and tomato salad which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each drizzled in balsamic and the artichoke and portabella pizza  This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am afterbar treat  

If youre feeling particularly saucey you can have yourself a glass of wine as well"
1,Wow Worst food poisoning of my life Ate here Saturday night for my birthday Started to just not feel right about 20 minutes afterward Sunday I never left the bed except to go be sick I lost a full FIVE pounds in one day Stay away from the salmon I for one will never go back Im really sad too because I decided on it from the reviews Another reviewer said they were disappointed in the recent quality I should have listened
5,Loved it Best French toast ever
5,I used Harvils Auto Body after a fender bender They were one of the auto body places that was included in State Farms program They were efficient friendly proactive highlyresponsive and helpful I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for memy vehicle when needed This level of highquality customer services is hard to come by If you have a choice choose Harvils You wont be disappointed
5,Came for the beer stayed for the scenery
5,Great subs the Club Supreme mikes style was really good
5,This is a car wash that I would highly recommend They do a great job and pay attention to the details It costs a little more at Hot Shots but its worth it It takes a bit more time too but worth it The main reason I would recommend this place they do an outstanding job and are consistent every time
5,"Nadya is one of the nicest people you will ever meet  Part of her personality is what kept me coming back

Recently she altered a bridesmaids dress for my girlfriend and did a terrific job  Flawless  In years past she has altered all of my work attire  I have since moved but whenever I return home if I ever need any work done I will bring it with

Nadya you are a wonderful person and any recommendation I can send your way I will"
5,"Taylors has such a refreshing cafe menu Ive been for breakfast far more often than lunch I hope to try dinner soon bc I think they feature live jazz on Wednesday nights 

Ive never ever had a bad meal In fact I always have a hard time deciding Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros eggs Benedict with a choice of meat waffles  the Mexican omelet 

I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylors I tried a friends once and have been hooked ever since But if you want a less intoxicating beverage try the iced chai latte Careful its so good youll be ordering another before you know it 

Bon Appetite"
5,"LOVED THE SWITCH WITH JENNIFER ANISTON what is wrong with film
critics today"
5,For so many reasons Costco is top notch but Im going to review their Opto department They are equally as stellar Dr Tieu is super friendly knowledgeable and very approachable The retail part has the best pricing on contacts frames and lenses compared to any competitor Lucky me they take my insurance and my yearly supply of contacts came to a big fat 0 after rebates Always ask about rebates for contacts both the Dr office and the retail desk will usually have some that you can combine
1,"Horrible experience We had a home emergency which forced us to move out for 15 days We referred to them by a friend We explained to them were Seniors on limited income but assured them theyd be paid in full We paid the medical and our insurance co verbally told them that once the bill was submitted they would be paid  But No No NO  Not our policy  They were holding our two kids for ransom

Horrible uncaring staff to deal with"
1,This place is the classic bait and switch joint  I ordered through the drivethru and told the person I was ordering that I had a coupon for a buy oneget one free Chicken Tender Sandwich  The bun was hard and not at all like the picture on the coupon The two small tenders were extremely rubbery and looked like they had been retrieved from the trash can after they had been tossed for being under a heat lamp too long The lettuce was the part that most people toss when cleaning and the tomatoes were thin and pale and looked like they had been genetically mutated   uhh I mean grown  This wasnt the first time the server manager did this to me I should have known better I used a coupon a while back there for a buy one get one free breakfast burrito and asked that they prepare it to look like the picture that appeared on the coupon My bad  When I got down the road and reached into the bag to take a bite the cook had apparently taken an onion and diced it up super fine and threw that in with it  If you want a decent hamburger or chicken sandwich without attitude and that looks as advertised or better go to smash burger As for this place never never  again  The only good Carls Jr I have found in the valley so far is off the Superstition Hwy 60 and Tomahawk  From the Manager down they strive to live up to their advertising
5,Great posole  and the kids love their bean and cheese burritos Thats all we have eaten no need to venture further on the menu Great hangover food The staff is always very friendly
1,"I have heard so many good reviews for this place so who wouldnt try it I should have taken the hints before I got my meal that this wasnt a good choice

Hint 1 Location  Its right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park

Hint 2 Food test  It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasnt up to par the guy wouldnt leave me alone about sampling

Hint 3 Decor  I know this should never have anything to do with the food but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town wobbly chairs wobbly table

I ordered the teriyaki chicken didnt think it would be bad I mean who can mess up teriyaki With chicken fried rice once again how on earth can you mess up fried rice 

The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day Such a horrible taste The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out kind of had a gross tangy after taste There also wasnt any spices or egg in the fried rice just a bunch of green onionwhich technically isnt a fried rice This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store

They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu until I noticed it wasnt cooked all the way through

But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce 

So the expensive 8 meal was so not worth it and I m sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited the food was great but today it was the grossest thing Ive ever had"
1,Not good And its not been for a couple of years There are advantages good location rarely busy good for larger groups But last few times weve been there have experienced average food and lousy service  When joining my already seated group on Saturday 328 the highschool hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wifes chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only 2 measly pieces of chicken in it  Only 2 beers on tap Garbage
5,Put it this way Every guest I have in Phoenix I force to get the Monte Cristo at Morning Glory It is just that good
5,My fear and avoidance of the dentist has been building for years However I simply couldnt put it off any longer With trepidation I scheduled an appointment at Downtown Dental and promptly received an email back with available times I went in not knowing what to expect Not only had the staff already found my insurance information they made a point to call me by the name I go by rather than my formal name and that put me at ease I sat down with Heather the hygienist and she was so warm and friendly that I instantly felt fine confessing to her my fear of the dentist She allayed my concerns and told me not to worry There was no guilt trip for not flossing or drinking too much soda which is always annoying Then the scary part the dental work It was uncomfortable and I hated it but soon it was over it wasnt that bad and I felt a thousand times better Dr Berschler came over and examined me and pointed out a few cavities we needed to take care of Then the even scarier part or so I anticipatedthe price But I was pleasantly pleased and relieved that the total cost after insurance was literally thousands less than Id been quoted by a dentist a year ago to take care of my problems In fact the total cost is very reasonable this isnt a dentist looking to take advantage of you I couldnt have been more pleased and delighted at the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone in the office The convenient downtown location only makes it better I will never go to another dentist again and Im actually looking forward to my next appointment I cant recommend this office enough
5,This review if for their happy hour because thats all that Ive experienced  Love that they have happy hour all night on Sundays and Mondays  I live close by and used to frequent Wildfish often for happy hour  I usually get the crab cake and lobster bisque
5,Good food
5,"Let me tell you about my first crush in Phoenix It happened to me when I least expected I was sitting at my small cubicle during my first job Birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different When I walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker I noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust It later turned into love and Ive been happy every since 

I silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I cant imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat Over the years Honey Moon Sweets has been my goto bakery for a special occasion Ive purchased the basic cake for birthday parties Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakerys mind When planning my sisters baby shower I knew exactly where to go I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake It was three tiers blue with rattles pacifier building blocks a crib a teddy bearyou name it filling the top Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys It was almost too gorgeous to eat but we couldnt resist it so enjoyed every bite It was just as good as it looked if not better Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand As you can imagine cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budgetfriendly but for what you get from the cake its reasonably priced Just save your coins for a special occasion because its worth it I promise"
5,Food is outstanding Rebecca rocks
5,Im sure most people dont go to a fancy steak restaurant for the Mac n cheese but as a mac aficionado its practically my duty And the mac here well its high quality I like to order the lobster mac sans lobster not a big fan of seafood which without the seafood is actually quite inexpensive Now be warned this is real heavy mac n cheese Its so cheesy and thick and delicious dont plan on being able to wiggle out of your booth any time soon after eating it
5,FEZ should stand for Fabulous Exotic ZExperience I was planning on making it here for ages but couldnt until I found out the new metro rail is ride outside I needed a quiet place to read and was much obliged when they turned off all music by my request  I was able to read my Nancy Bartholomew novles with great intensity The staff left me alone for hours and the intoxicating rosemary smell really opened my buds The atmosphere is definatly trendy After I finnaly soaked it all in I would def give this place 5 stars although I didnt try the food or bar
5,"Better than Starbucks anyday 
The staff encourage their customers to get creative and provide new drink suggests to add to their list such as The Annihilator
My personal Favorite The Cookie with a little raspberry"
5,"Get ready to get meat drunk then fall into a meat coma Although this is not a nationwide chain this is what a chain restaurant can and should be its great You begin with an immaculate salad bar Definitely the best one I have ever seen or tasted for that matter Hell you have to love a salad bar that has a whole wheel of Parmesan cheese for you to enjoy Enough with the salad lets talk about the star of the show the meat Transcendental might be too strong of a word but it is pretty damn close 
It is endless amounts of meat prepared 15 different ways all seasoned perfectly You have to love something that is seasoned so well that if adding salt or pepper to it at the table would over season it This place is pretty much a buffet that comes to you and after trying several meats its great because you dont want to move lol And the best part is is that you tell them when to come to you I could go on and on but if you have about 60 bucks to spend and want to enjoy a great meal just go here and leave in physical pain from over eating like I do"
5,"Yum I was a fan of Grimaldisbut this place surpasses them We had half chicken tuscana garlic cream sauce and half chicken artichoke pesto sauce Amazing Great flavors Usually Im a fan of ranch on pizza fan dont hatenot needed here
Comes with the traditional crust which was really enjoyable but also available wthin crust or wheat crust 2 extra for wheat
Server Zach was nice offered suggestions and was on top of things Kind of soft spoken given the tvs and other restaurant noise Hostess seemed like she was pretty excited to be there and everyone was polite
Prices werent too bad18 for a large pizza 8 for an individual Variety of toppings salads appetizers calzones and drinks Beers ranged from 3755 for the 16 oz 
Excited to go back and try some more pizza"
5,"I cannot recommend Phoenix Knife House enough  

There are very few places where you can go and physically put your hands on so many different Japanese knives which is obviously key in any knife purchase  If youve ever spent hours in the kitchen doing prep and chopping blisters are a very real possibility if the knife doesnt fit  Ive discovered over the last several years of cooking at home that I prefer a lighter and bolsterless knife for high speed chopping which ultimately led me back to PKH for a purchase  Last year I purchased a Fujiwara 150mm petty for less than 60 and its been a great knife my girlfriend also likes it because its light and maneuverable  She bought me a Misono UX10 for my birthday which will ultimately replace my Henckels for most uses  Bottom line go in tap into Eytans knowledge of the knives and care and maintenance and get better tools for the job  Its well worth it

I bring all my kitchen knives here to get sharpened either by hand or on the grinding wheel  Today I had four knives sharpened three on the wheel one by hand and two with tip damage  Total cost  13  

Bonus purchases are tax free  Highly recommended"
5,"WOW what can I say our friends have eaten here for years and we finally got to eat at Don and Charlies for the first time in all the years that we have been coming to Spring Training  

We had an excellent dinner i was in the mood for fish and had the Macademia crusted Halibut WONDERFUL My hubby had the prime rib and finished off every last juicy bite the scalloped potatoes were the BEST I have ever had at any restaurant

Must make this one of our usual stops during our yearly visit to Az"
1,Will never eat here again Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was Horrible first time experience
5,"Saw this place in the Yelp email  Needed to take my son to Toys R Us to use a gift card and it occurred to me that Habit Burger was right there so I suggested we have lunch there rather than the usual McDs  I temped him with the offer of a chocolate shake

I was amazed with the cleanliness and brightness of this place  There was a line when we got there but it moved quickly  The tables were packed but we managed to snag a 2top pretty soon after getting in line  My son had the kids grilled cheese meal something you dont find at your standard fast food place and I had a charburger  We shared his fries and the shake

OMG  the burger was heavenly  The roll gets a little grill to it so it has a little crunch on the inside  It was not greasy at all just tasty and soooo good  The fries were equally ungreasy and good  crunchy too  The chocolate shake  my son only had about 3 sips which left me to drink the rest of it dang it  was absolutely delish  And the prices were outstanding

Its a good thing there isnt a Habit Burger closer to my house  Id eat there all the time  Five Guys  Forget em"
1,Went last week and ordered a dozen variety I didnt care for any of them very dry the frosting wasnt very goodeven my 9 yr old daughter spit her cupcake out
5,"We recently had a pleasure trip to AZ and I booked at the Fairmont Princess and I must say I made an AWESOME choice 
 Room was I guess a standard King but it was so large and spacious with a couch and seating area as well as a very comfortably appointed bath and patio The decor looked fresh and new as well Very contemporary Lovely We were in building C and overlooked the rosearoma garden which was quite quiet and pretty Might have been a little better to overlook the lagoon with the firey fountain but we were pleased none the less
 Pools were the best We swam in the main south pool the east pool and used the slides the kids area as well Did a lot of night swimming as it was hot and gotta tell younight swimming rules We rarely get to do where I live
 Restaurants and bars were very goodif a bit priceyas well We had dinner at Bourdon Steak by Michael Mina which was very tasty and nice ambiance Ate at Hacienda Restaurant and also at the bar at an outside table Kinda liked eating at the bar better Yum of the drinks 
 Great tripgreat placewe will be back"
5,My husband called the chicken fajita burrito one bad ass burrito The carne asada burrito and quesadilla were equally yummy Nice stop for a quick bite
5,"Im a girl who knows her way around a donut The boyfriend and I would usually venture out to Chandler to get our Bosa Donut fix so I was super excited to discover they had opened a location closer to home I was also super scared for my waistband

Bosa is hands down the best donut shop in the Valley Not that there is a ton of competition but still Theyre really good They offer a wide variety from your classic cake to puffy glazed filled to fritters My favorite is the glazed twist So chock full of sugary sweetness my teeth kinda hurt just thinking about it Their donuts are always fresh and they keep a good stock available so youre not stuck with only the coconut donuts

I brought in a bunch to work the other day and my coworkers gobbled them up Who doesnt love being handed a frosted piece of donut heaven

Im sure I will become a regular of the Tempe Bosa in no time"
5,Next Door Realty is fantastic  Daradee Murray handled the short sale of my home recently and the entire transaction went unbelievably smooth  From start to finish she was an excellent communicator  She took all of our concerns into account and made the process a breeze for us  I would highly recommend Next Door to anyone looking to buy or sell a home  The personal attention you receive is unparalleled
5,"We happened upon this place on Sunday We had our 2 12 year old with us and she was yelling about being hungry We quickly ducked into Zinburger All three of us had burgers The kids burger was huge and it came with fries We also ordered the sweet potato fries The people around us had milkshakes and they looked delicious I also noticed fried zucchini and figure next time Ill order those instead of fries 

We were in a rush and had something at 6 pm We told the waiter we were in a hurry He was great friendly and accommodating We were seated next to the hostess stand and my daughter kept trying to engage the folks standing there Everyone was so nice 

My constructive feedback would be that I ordered my burger medium well and I received it medium rare It still tasted yummy and I ate it Had it been served that way to my hubby  he would not have been able to stomach the red juice flowing from the burger"
5,"Addicted to duck fat fries  Curry mayo is a perfect complement to duck fat fries  Did I mention how awesomely delicious duck fat fries are  You know what forget that I said anything about duck fat fries  They only make a limited amount and I dont want you to go  Nope  Dont go 

I guess I should mention the rest of the menu  Everything is awesome  Nutella rules  Seriously"
5,This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it Good flavor lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup which is pretty freakin great Theres alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware
5,I seriously cant get enough of this spicy goodness All I ever wanna go is SIAM and nowhere else Ive been to so many Thai restaurants in AZ the past month and NOTHING compares to Siam BEEF MA SA MAN curry is so addictingly amazing and the pad thai is always cooked to perfection Im actually craving it as I type this
5,For some reason these self serve frozen yogurt places have popped up all over the valley and they are all very similar What I like about this place are the choices I usually dont have any issues Im a mint chocolate chip man and thats typically what I order My girlfriend on the other hand likes to mix it up and try new flavors and toppings This place has the largest selection of flavors and toppings of any of the self served frozen yogurt places weve been too For those of you who are calorie conscience as I am they post the nutrition facts right buy the flavor so you know exactly what youre getting
5,John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable He has a customer for life from me
5,"The obsession started about 2 yrs ago and I havent looked back since
Started with getting them catered for lunch then a trip here or there to the restaurant SO GOOD The bread is amazing but the love sweat tears and what ever else they pop in there is addicting Hmmm now I am wondering what it is they put in there Anyway I wont think too long and hard about that one But tomorrow Im definitely heading back for the Vermonter gotta feed the addiction"
1,Weve been going here for 25 years and I had my first BAD meal recently A rotten chicken tamale the corn meal might have had rancid fat in it or the chicken was rotten either way it was stinky The wait staff didnt seem outraged and shrugged it off as though this has happened before  I may go back here in another year but Rositas Place is off limits for me now
5,"If youre at all a Foodie you cant come to Phoenix or anywhere within 50 miles and not visit Matts Big Breakfast  The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place  I hope they dont very enlarge this placeit would so spoil it

Foodhave anything  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness  My personal favs are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locallychanges frequently 

This was on Diner Driveins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there

Side notethis was way cool  On our last visit there were 4 of us and if youve been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4  So were waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus takes our orders  When were seated about 15 min later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated  Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table  Much appreciated service"
5,"What can I say we eat here once a week for lunch cuz we can walk here We come here for happy hour twice a week cuz we can walk here 

So yeah its pretty convenient but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and its a great place to eatnlearn

And we LOVE Tony because that guy says hello to EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME 

Trust me on this one jump off the freeway for happy hour youll know what I mean when Tony says hello to you too

PS get the three meat calzone You look great and can afford the calories"
5,What an awesome business Friendly knowledgable people that make you feel like family when you come in I cant to tell you how refreshing it is to walk into an audition and feel welcomed Auditioning is a scary enough experience without feeling intimidated by your environment and the people auditioning you Here youll find great people who love what they do and have an extensive amount of knowledge and experience Oh and I also recommend taking one of Faiths workshops I took one recently and I learned some very valuable tools that will definitely help me in future auditions D
5,Delicious food and excellent staff make this small French restaurant worthy of five stars We began with a glass of fabulous wine that we brought it is byob and ordered the onion tart as an appetizer The taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal I ordered the marinated chicken This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite time and time again My girlfriend got the filet which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes For dessert we ordered the tart of the day which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbreadtasting tart Just delicious The service was wonderful very efficient and friendly It is not cheap it was 99 for the appetizer two entrees and dessertbut for the experience and the exquisite flavors I will go back for any special occasion guaranteed
5,Everything you need to feel like you opened a time capsule  Place makes me want to have 5 houses to slather in vintage odds and ends  The place is very well organized and themed which makes it easy to find items while youre on the hunt
1,Love the idea  vegan Mexican Have tried to eat there twice Both times checked their FB page for hours both times they were closed Called their phone number no one answered No sign no explanation on FB Pathetic
5,"bank building turn to a coffee beanery is way cool 

plenty of seats to settle yourself in and crack open your books and do your homework the free wifi is helpful too but the connection lags sometimes when their a bunch of people hopping online to check their myspace

it gets chilly at time i suggest bring a sweater if youre the unlucky one seated underneath the AC vent 

the vault room is great when trying to escape the loud chatter in the main room just dont forget to turn off your cell phone when youre in there its kind of rude

if you wanna be shaking out of your pants i suggest the Iced Toddy its strong and it should keep you up all night if you have a big project the following day

customer service is very nice and helpful"
5,"I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment considering I have recently bestowed it as My Favorite Restaurant  thats a big title to carry 

I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test  They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle  as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico  Their chunky guac is delish and summery as they put orange slices in it 

Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz I think it taste like CheezIts their best appetizer is the Elote  grilled cornonthecob with cheese on it It literally melts in your mouth Oh and it doesnt get stuck in your teeth like most cornonthecobs tend to 

The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet  except you know orange 

I love everything about this restaurant  salsas food drinks atmosphere prices entertainment on Wednesday  they just need to get rid of that damn giant ugly silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar"
5,Bobby Q is GREAT We enjoyed EVERYTHING brisket sandwich baby back ribs brisket with spicy sauce  yum Blooming onion  just right Baked potato crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside  withe barbeque pork and the fixingsmmmmmmmm  Our waitress perfect  Go  now
5,"This store made me feel like I had died and went to fabric heaven  There is just so much beautiful wonderful amazing fabric  I dropped a pretty penny but Ive already used some of my perfect fabric for great projects

The place is clean the staff is super friendly and patient especially with newbies like me  When I brought 10 different reams of fabric up and had to stop and really think about how much I needed patience came with a smile  It seems like everything even the high end designers are around 10yard

If you get bogged down with all the fabric that you are falling in love with they have a cute little table set up with these funny little signs that say get your paws off my fabric which made me chuckle  Maybe Im turning into an old lady who loves silly stuff like that

Despite the somewhat sketchy location 35th Ave Sew and Vac is my new goto for fabric"
1,Bad music slow service disgusting overpriced drinks and annoying patrons  Definitely wouldnt come back if someone paid me to I cant even drink this margarita
5,Anyone who tells you this place isnt amazing is cu cu for coco puffs The owners are equally amazing They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions There really isnt anything on the menu that isnt good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots I always go for the soup but that hasnt stopped me from trying everything else Everything is always fresh and delicious Their happy hour is awesome as well
5,"I originally came here because I heard they have a gluten free menui expected one or two pizzas probably cheese and one other choice But they have a FULL menu of pizzas salads and appetizers that are gluten free and they are DELICIOUS 

Pizza was my absolute favorite food in my past glutenfilled life Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them and they are always too dry too thin too soggy or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like

 Picazzos gluten free pizza is delicious the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be the flavor is true to pizza crust my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering regular crust

There is also a range of appetizers that are delicious caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves 

The employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerancethey check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and nonGF foods together in your to go box 

I love it If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza this will be your new favorite place Totally worth the drive and the money But the prices are very reasonable for GF food"
5,Mastros serves up the best steak in Scottsdale  They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes  Prices are steep After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddys
5,"I will start this review off by saying that I would normally have given this place 4 stars but for a large dogfriendly patio and immediate water bowls the minute your dogs butt hits the ground they get the extra star 

We went today a Sunday and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have a female harlequin Great Dane and knew that it was fate  We sat by them because they seemed awesome and in great company the food flourished in my eyes  

They have a pretty decent beer selection they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bells Two Hearted Ale but apparently its an amazing IPA I knew Id love mine he LOVED his

We had the Mac and Cheese which was awesome but not as amazing as others Ive had  So order it if your a Mac person but dont if youre not  

We had two sandwiches for dinner I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak UNBELIEVABLE  and Seann had the RBC an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others

Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app a sandwich and two beers but it was definitely worth trying

Overall the food would have gotten a four but the experience with cool people around us and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal  Now being added into the rotation  Thank you Main Ingredient  "
5,Yummy yummy yummy Absolutely loved it  kick back quiet people nice not crowded and breakfast was crazy yummy
5,My boyfrind and I attended here this past weekend on Serptember 82012 to celebrate our one year anniversary Every employee went out o their way to tell us Happy Anniversary We were seated quickly after entering the restaraunt Our waiter was knowledgeable friendly and very professional We were given our own privacy to celebrate intimately The food was amazing and we both enjoyed our selves so much Thank you Meling Pot We are going to make you our annual celebration spot
5,Cute busy place in Central Phoenix Not hiding behind gimmicks to make themselves authentic Simple and sweet Staff is well versed in Japanese food if you havent had it in years ask Great staff great food great times
1,"I think they need to hire a better chief the food doesnt taste right

My mom said she can teach them how to cook for free"
1,"Never Again
I brought my Mountain Bike in which I bought 1 week earlier from Walmart to have them replace my flat inner tubes with puncture resistant tubes  I came back 20 minutes later when they said it would be done and as I rode away the back tire rhythmically rubbed against the back brake  When I returned and told them about it I was told the back wheel was not true  It was true for the whole short week since I purchased it from Walmart  I plan to take it to their competitor Landis and pay the extra 1525 to have the wheel put back to the straight condition it was in when I brought it to Slippery Pig in the first place   I would never give a shop another penny for an extra service I should never have needed on a brand new bike which coasted perfectly when I brought it in"
1,Went in for acrylics on Friday and it was horrible Ive been getting acrylics for years and it has never been a problem to have them filed downuntil this time The tip of one finger was filed down so bad that its blistered At least the nail tech put some antiseptic on it so its not infected Also when I put some lotion on my hands Tuesday a lot of my nails started getting sticky and filmy like they were going to disintegrate NOT NORMAL I removed mine today and found that my nails were finely filed so it looks like they would have fallen off soon anyway Im not going back there again
5,"In town for business and came to Pappadeauxs for dinnerwhat a great experience  Hostess wait staff and servers were all outstanding  The food was amazing  Perfectly cooked vegetables to accompany the Costa Rican Mahi  Ice cold beer on a hot 102 degree day was a welcome addition

Although we later found out our waiter was in training it was his first day he was attentive professional and available to answer any questions we had

Highly recommended"
5,"Ive been to a ton of Pho places here in the valley and this is the best one Ive been to by far  The prices are reasonable and the Pho was fantastic  The rolls were pretty good but not the best Ive had around here that honor belongs to Saigon Pho not too far from this place  BBQ beef rolls there are fantastic but I digress  I havent tried anything else at Pho Van but it all looked pretty good too  

The place is super clean and the service was ridiculously fast I dont know if it was just my luck or if thats a regular thing

I want to come back but its not close to my house  However its worth the drive if you ever get that Pho craving"
5,"Count us in for a 5 Combo a Oaxaca Special  two hard tacosmaybe some chips and salsa to go

Best Mexican fast food aroundand cheap

Always busy at lunch but they get through the orders in a timely manner  Seating can be tricky so have one order and another stalk tables 

You can park behind the place and walk through the back doorlittle FYI"
5,My boss asked me to find someone to clean the office windows about 50 large panes inside and out so I got in touch with Brad  He was very professional throughout the experience and his mastery of this craft is phenomenal  The windows were crystal clear within a few hours he did a very thorough job  Punctual efficient and easy to work withhis rate was very competitive and his work is worth every penny  The office looks brand new
5,Ladies in the flooring section are very knowledgeable and helpful  Though I do think they are a bit understaffed they were gracious and friendly  Fairly large in stock flooring section compared to other stores
5,Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco Everyones really helpful and friendly We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean
5,"Enterprise Pools keeps my pool looking PERFECT for swimming  Not only do they preform topnotch weekly service sweeping clearing the baskets and making sure the chemicals are right but they are great at communicating

One of the tough things about owning a pool and not being a pool expert is knowing whats going on  They always take the time to explain whats happening in a way I can understand

Broken pump or filter No problem They do repairs too  Theyll even fill you in on what you need to do as the seasons change or how to handle those pesky pool destroying monsoon storms"
5,"Two words for you Mouth  Orgasm

Wifey and I decided to eat here for our 5 year wedding anniversary I have to say this is one of the best meals Ive ever eaten hands down We bought a Restaurantcom gift certificate that cost 1000 for a 5000 Gift Certificate They also have half priced bottles of wine on Friday nights as well

I went with the 5 course menu I chose 2 of the dishes and let the chef pick the other three We started out with the Crudo Cheese plate that was phenomenal It had goat cheese goat feta goat mozarella sooo good cherry compote roasted dates tomatoes cured lamb jerky smoked olives and truffles with toast If that doesnt give you a food stiffy your not human The first dish I had which was one I picked was the butterfish crudo It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now Holey cow Next I had the albacore crudo with truffles apples black garlic and pepper Another amazing dish My next dish was one the chef selected as well it was their Japanese Fish Market Special I dont recall the type of fish but it was good I felt bad for this plate though it had to follow some illlll dishes The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin It had hen of the woods crimini potato and was topped with an egg I felt it was just too much a little clunky Thats probably just my taste though there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta Friggin amazing I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into its ear and smack it on the boohiney  

We went with a great bottle of Nebbiolo that was exceptional The service was excellent At first I was kind of weirded out with the restaurant being inside a retail shop but we moved to one of the high top tables and it felt more like a quaint little cafe What a great meal fargin amazing  Pics to come"
5,Best TexMex in the valley The chips and salsa are home made and probably the best I have ever eaten I had shrimp tacos which were delicious staff was very friendly and down to earthif you ate downtown give them a try
5,"Tried Roys for the first time last night when we met some friends who rave about their Aloha Hour Happy Hour  Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations

The bar area is relatively small but very classy  We were able to have few drinks at the bar 5 for beer wine and their signature cocktails before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 peoplethanks to Leah and the hostess staff you guys are great  Didnt have a bad drink  loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish as was the mojito jalapeno margarita mai tai and wine  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu but sounds like the menu changes often so dinersdrinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year  

For food we tried most of the HH specials  Everything was spot on  excellent flavors and beautifully presented  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites sushi rolls with the lobster potstickers being a close second  Some friends ordered dinnerand were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi which was so yummy  The happy rice on the side was great too   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke  something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona HI last year  I couldnt believe the flavorseating poke in the AZ desert  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering  

Definitely recommend Roys for seafood that is excellently prepared  Aloha Hour is a must  Extra props to Matt our waiter and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service  We had a great night"
5,"Troy the owner is a brilliant businessman Being a pharmacist myself I am familiar with the quality of his products and his facility Trust me when I say his sterile compounding areas are more advanced than many hospitals in the Valley

After spending a day at his old facility when I was still training I felt comfortable enough to send my mother to Troy so that he could help her with hormone replacement therapy The docs around town trust him enough to let him dictate what a patient needs they simply sign off on his recommendations My mom has had a huge increase in her quality of life since seeing Troy and I feel the compounded HRT is safer than the Prempro she used to take

Do not hesitate to consult a compounding pharmacist if youre having health issues that arent being adequately addressed Troy is one of the best in the Valley Its worth the drive to consult with him and further prescriptions can be mailed to your home"
5,"I love this restaurant concept It makes for a fun dinner between friends and family I wish there were ones like it in Central Phoenix so I dont have to drive a half hour for good food and a good dining experience 
The veggie options offered are plentiful and fresh which is important to me The broth is so flavorful But be warned weak tongued restaurantgoers the spicy broth has a kick that will stick

Some are saying its too expensive I think its worth it"
5,Dont let the slightly sketchy neighborhood put you off  Baiz market has some of the best food in town  The small deli cafe  Not sure what to call it located in the market has all of the staples such as shwarma and falafel  the prices are cheap The service is snappy and friendly and the food is exceptional especially considering the price  Wash down your meal with any one of many exotic drinks or just choose a diet coke in the beverage cooler  Even if youve stuffed yourself silly wander on back to the bakery  The assortment of traditional Middle Eastern sweets cant be matched anywhere in town  Come early and wander around in the market to pick up your selection of hard to find ingredients
1,This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the service went way down hill  The new owners hire lots of college students with tattoos everywhere as well as lots of piercings  Seems like tattoos and too many piercings are a job requirement along with disrespect and a lack of desire  The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and doesnt seem to matter how often you let management know I just dont think they care  Also in the past few years there is a growing number of homeless that sit out front begging for money  They sit so close to the outside patio that you have them dining with you or at least it feels that way making you incredibly uncomfortable  Our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless were stationed  One girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting  Management obviously doesnt care and does nothing to improve anything so we go way out of our way now to eat at the other Greek in Chandler at Chandler Mall
5,"The service has always been really good

I love LOTS of things on the menu The dixie pan fried chicken is great  Theres a great little sticky bun that comes with it  The Del mar salad is great  Ive had great experiences going to chelseas kitchen  

Overall its in my heavy rotation on places I always say YES lets go there"
5,A very reliable local garage Bill is all about great customer service and goes the extra mile He deflated my fears about being taken by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance Hes a truly good guy knows his stuff and will work to save me money if he can find it I trust Bill and 25th Street Automotive Thanks and well continue to bring our wheels into your shop
5,Of all the Chipotles I really like this one  The staff is exceptionally friendly and I dont think Ive ever been in the place and Iveve been a lot where they werent meticulously cleaning the restaurant with soapy suds
5,Dig it Good beers on tap Tasty food Friendly servers Cool place to hang out and relax My fav pasty is the cajun chicken with the spicy sauce Dont forget to check out the desserts Towards the back is an iPad where you can pick a few tunes to be playedkinda neat if youre in the mood for something in particular If you havent checked it out you should I like this location better than the Tempe location because it has more seating and a better scene for visiting with friends
5,"How can anyone not give these guys a 5 star  Cafe Rio invented the sweet pork burrito and nobodyand I mean NOBODY can do it better  I moved here a year ago from Utah where Cafe Rios are as abundant as Micky Dees  and I was so happy to see the Cafe Rio sign  

I eat there to much  Its a 30 min drive to get there from where I live but I love that I dont ever have to wait in line as long as I did when eating at the Utah ones

Let me help you with what to order  No serious if you are reading thisgo there TODAY and order this  

Sweet pork burrito with black beans hot sauce enchilada style with pico and guac  no lettuce unless you like lettuce  I dont"
5,Mill Ave has been missing a good breakfast nook and it has made me very sad Until now The atmosphere is very modern The color scheme is gray orange and black and boy do they stick to it down to the orange frosted cupcakes Impressive I had the best french toast I have ever had in my life right here at NCounter I have only eaten here once and usually I dont give five stars out after the first visit but this place is THAT good So happy to have such a fabulous breakfast restaurant so close to home
1,"1 star for service and attitudeThe food was delicious  but the staff was very hateful I am writing this review I dont remember the waitresses name but I do remember that she was short  hispanic  and she was pregnant at the time She was incredibly hatefulSo hateful and rude to me and my parents I do know why she did this is because I am transgendered I was wearing leggings and I was carrying a black polo purse 

So I thought that this happened because of how I was dressed and how I looked  but that really wasnt the caseI went back 2 weeks later and I dressed differently More manly ha Different waitresses  same great food  same hateful attitudes I will stress to everyone reading this to save your time and money and go to a different pizza hut or a different pizza joint to get better service"
5,Great Job
5,"Wait a secondI have not written a review  This is nuts

AnywaysI adore this place  LGO and the pizzeria are my favorite places in the worldlolI am here at least 46 times per week  It is nuts  Anywaysthe reason I am here all the time is because it is FABULOUS  This place can never go wrong  The orange and fennel salad it amazing  It is the perfect mix and each bite and a delight in your mouth and to your taste buds  I often get this salad through out the week  I love the kale and quinoa salad too  It is my go to salad  I am obsessed with the avocado pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese and the roasted corn pizza with prosciutto  I wish I could get enough but I cannot  The ambiance is awesome MrLynn is a genius and made this place so welcoming and open  I love how its so laid back and romantic at the same time  The parking is difficult but you expect that since it is so popular  Now the Peanut Butter Pie  OMG OMG OMG  There are no wordsit is DELICIOUS  I try to refuse every time but I cannot  I really enjoy the sangria  The wine selection is great  I just love this place"
5,The place to go during spring training after a game and see a baseball player will be crowded for sure the experience is just really neat though the place is covered head to toe with sports memorabilia definitely the place to go if youre a visiting sports fan in scottsdale
5,"Came here on a Friday night after a bike ride As an Irish bar there is a lot of whiskey on the wall but they can make whatever you need The food was a hell of a lot better than I thought it was going to be 
On the encouragement of the bouncer I ordered the wings which were meaty but Ive had better What I should have gotten was the shepards pie 2 of my friends got it and it was VERY good Im going to go back just get it on my own 
Lastly this place dishes out cheap strong drinks Good place to get sauced before hitting a club"
5,"We attended this event today and loved it The grounds are beautiful and spread out so it didnt seem like it was overly crowded 

This is a well thought out event with food trucks located throughout so if you get hungry there will be food near by

The admission price was 7 and we felt it was a bargain 

There are a variety of artists so there is something for everyone to look at andor buy"
5,I should have done this so long ago but we forget our Doctors need reviews too Ive sent my boyfriend my family and my friends to her You should know about her too Ive been going to Dr Bradley for 10 years She is my all time favorite doctor because she is always bright smiling genuine and just overall warm You want to thank her and hug her at the same time Her staff is professional and friendly Mandy at the front desk is wonderful at her job Ive followed Dr Bradley to 2 locations and would never think of going anywhere else Shes helped me with everything from migraines to pnuemonia to well woman check ups to getting my gall bladder removed What a versatile and knowledgeable woman she is I take my son to her now and he isnt afraid to go in Peace of mind knowing we will be treated well and taken care of is all I could really ask for in a general doctor
5,"Just had my first hot dog at Short Leash Dogs and quite honestly I cant call it a hot dog because that just conjures up images of well a hot dog And Short Leash Dogs are so much more and better than a hot dog the way most people know hot dogs Know what I mean No Well go have a Short Leash Dog 

Really unique combinations various dog options all local meats and produce  bratwurst beer hot veggie 

My friend and I shared an Aiko we chose the brat as our dog with mango chutney red onions cilantro mayo and jalapeño on a naan you might have read that in other reviews no traditional buns here 

You can find the Short Leash Dogs truck at the Phoenix Public Market on Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings and if you follow them on Twitter shortleashdogs you can find out whenwhere else they make regular stops scottsdale central phoenix Track em down and eat their food And talk to them  Brad and Kat are smart enthusiastic folks with a great sense of humor and offer superb food and service Whats not to love"
1,"Normally have had great service  food here but on Fathers Day Nicole H was simply horrible  Rude slow nonhelpful etc  Just a total fail  

A different fooddeliverer brought out food and auctioned it off didnt know who got what and I asked for a refill on my empty water glass but he didnt bring it after 15 minutes and Nicole didnt notice so I had to bring it up to her

Their bloody Marys taste just like tomato juice with tobasco  Nothing special at all  And for 12  SHAME

The coq au vin was great

5,"Southwest blows its competitors so far out of the water I actually feel bad for the other airlines  
1 Of the countless times Ive flown with them my flight has been delayed only twice and both times less than one hour
2 NO BAG FEES  
3 Nine times out of ten the lowest price
4 Killer customer service laced with sarcasm veiled cynicism and high efficiency  I love it
5 They never give me an inquisitive look when I order a cocktail on the super early morning flights  Thank you for not judging me SW Flight Attendants"
5,i hate going to places that i can goto near home in Phx for the Cubs games but my daughter wanted pizza and we saw Z and had to go becuz we know how good it is I like this one alot better then ours
5,"BACON people  Spicy Italian sausages brats even heirloom veggies by the pound  Locally raised hogs and none of the extra chemicals the corporations and grocery stores use  I have found my personal piggy promised land and it is The Meat Shop  

I headed over here with some buddies after hearing that some local restaurants and patrons have been taking notice of the flavor and quality they offer  We were quite pleased  The staff were helpful and knowledgeable about the meats cuts and preparation  We grilled up everything that night  the sausages the brats the veggies even the bacon because why not  I think we spent a grand total of 20 and we still had enough leftovers to throw in with some sunny side up eggs and toast the next morning for breakfast  This place is fantastic and surprisingly the same cost as most of the stuff youll find in the grocery store  I cant wait to head back over for round 2"
5,"Love this place  Their slices are delicious and HUGE and a great deal  Service is always fast and good  Their loyalty programs frequent visits and VIP card are also great   The fact that theyre locally owned and support the local community doesnt hurt either  

Its basically the only place I go to for pizza nowadays  1 slice is more than enough and I love that I can get it just the way that I want  If youre a member of their VIP program free to join you can also get the slices for dinner too"
5,I love the Tempe Library The Culture Pass is a great program the audiobook selection is good and the seemingly unlimited resources are wonderful
5,"Really good food fun atmosphere great experience and totally unique and fun 
I would way rather spend my money at a one of a kind family owned shop than a cheaper dime a dozen corporate mcdonalds"
5,"I am in love  This restaurant does everything a good restaurant should  Ambiance service and product were good  The only disappointment I had was with the hour wait on the Monday we went without a reservation

My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday  Two had the short ribs  Tender to a fault served with delicious BarBQue sauce and pecan grits  One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes
My meal was a huge pork chop stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding  

For an app I split the chop salad  It deserves special mention and I do recommend it but it is not a sustaining salad more of a amusebouche  For dessert we split the peanutbutter cheese cake delicious

The beverages deserve some mention  The wine list is this restaurants only fault it is tooooo long  There is a smaller delicious bytheglass selection  The beer selection is well crafted  I had two of my favorite beers Dogfishhead Chicory Stout something I had only had by bottle wonderful

I normally dont like highpriced eateries bc there is often a lack of creativity Cowboy Ciao doesnt disappoint  Recommended over any Capital Griller or Flemmingsery for creativity and value for dollar"
5,"OK I went based on Tim Cs Yelp review of this place and I am so glad I did I rode my bike up there around 1PM Wednesday afternoon and I have to say I was not disappointed 

Even though it was hot out the outdoor table was surprisingly cool and comfortable I got an iced soy latte and it was so good I dont know how to explain it but there is great tasting espresso and there is bland espresso This place just has great tasting espresso I found out while I was there that Ted the guy who made it had roasted the beans himself You can buy the beans from them if you are one of those industrious people who grind and brew your own espresso drinksI am not I prefer to leave that to the professionals  He actually ground the espresso when I ordered my drink If you get the chance please go see what I am talking about You will notice how much better the espresso is

The place itself is so beautiful and relaxing If you sit outside like I did you are basically sitting in a big outdoor garden It is kept cool by the overhead canopy and the swamp cooler air blowing out from inside the coffee shop Ted was really friendly I felt comfortable just hanging out for a while reading my book Unfortunately the coffee shop closes at 2 PM otherwise I bet it would be beautiful at night This place definitely looks like something that would be in a cool little town somewhere and  not off of a busy street like Hayden Rd 

Ted also told me he makes the lemonade himself fresh squeezed something I love and will definitely try When I go back I think I will go a bit earlier  I may do a bit of plant shopping as well while I am there

Bottom line Great atmosphere drinks and service"
5,These guys are great  I had an old Craftsman mower probably 8yo that even sat unused in a basement for a couple years  It coughed and wheezed barely even turning over  I brought it to them and now it works and even looks brand new
5,Super
5,Best value for your money   Clean comfy beds  Quite  Great breakfast that is included
5,They dont serve food they serve sex on a plate At first glance the place looks like a hallway but its really a flavor factory hidden away between two buildings no one cares about because those places dont have Pastys The service is fast  friendly and the music is off the chain  The food is not to be forgotten though there are so many selections of Pasty variations that anyone with any craving will loose all control of there facial expressions I only wish the place was bigger there have been times when Ive  had to wait for a space to open up but thats not necessarily a bad thing  That time allowed me  to prepare myself for the nirvana inducing flavorgasm that is The Cornish Pasty Company
5,"This is a great breakfast stop  Gotta love the homemade biscuits are you kidding me  Awesome CB is a huge chain but they do some great things  

The only thing is the way they have designed the space the servers are in the back a lot too much  They need to be on the floor more to make sure the cups stay filled up"
5,Kindred Spirits has closed their doors It is a sad thing that we on the west side of Phoenix cannot support such a friendly and community oriented business AND one that gave you the option to drop by for a quick coffee or for a more complete dining experience The live music on the weekends was also something a bit rare for our side of town and will be missed Richard and Debra did a marvelous job updating the space and making it a warm and welcoming place I am sorry that Youngtown has lost this business
5,Wife and I had the large burgers Many options as to toppings whole grain bun is also an option Store is spotless and staff is young and cheerful I had sw style wguacamole and jalapeno spouse chose classic american cheeseburger We ordered sweet potato fries to split They are awesome and the single portion was large enough for 2 12 people We were advised in advance that burgers would be pink inside which we prefer If you want yours well done ask You order at counter and the food is brought to your booth This was our second visit and we would return Store is nnear movies in food are of Tempe marketplace so expect to spend some time looking for a spot
1,"The service at this location is absolutely atrocious I went to the Starbucks to get a Frappuccino as Ive done many times at this location without issue The employee working the counter had an absolutely revolting tattoo near her collar bone and a scowl on her face She asked me if I had a membership AFTER I had swiped my card then said Too late when I told her I had one

Then the idiot with the spiky blonde hair made me a Frappuccino that was basically brown water I told her to make it again She made it again then informed me that she put extra shots of chocolate in it and I should ask for extra chocolate if I dont want it to taste like water I have never had a problem with the way my drink tasted until that day but apparently the problem lies with me

Im not the one who chose a career in customer service If the coffee slingers at this branch cant pretend to enjoy their jobs they should be put out on the street"
5,"This is the best restaurant in Phoenix My wife and I have been eating out here for years Their servers are great and the food is always delicious The entire menu is very good and the specials are always unique

Check out their website at httpwwwphoenixcitygrillecom"
5,"I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table  amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne

Unfortunately they had sold out of the oysters but the other dishes wed ordered were fabulous  starting with a seared tuna dish then softshell crab roll rainbow roll and the green mussels The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly  just the right temperature with a peppery rub the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner 

The thing I appreciated most was actually the service  we werent rushed or hassled and the food came out a dish at a time giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish At other sushi joints I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table and Im not what youd call a slow eater This was a happy medium for me The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking  its the little details that make a big difference to me

My only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the barbut thats what you get in Scottsdale"
5,"My boyfriend and I went to Film Bar last night to see Iron Sky Neither of us had been there before and the decision was made quickly so we had no idea what to expect The bartender was incredibly nice friendly informative and genuine The prices for the bar were very reasonable and I thought that 7 for tickets was MORE than reasonable We were there more than an hour early and it was so nice to just sit back on the low booths and chat

I gotta admit I totally fell in love with this little place and I cant wait to go back

My ONLY concern is that by the time our movie was done there was a DJ playing music so loudly that you could hear it in the theater and you couldnt talk without shouting in the bar so we had to go outside to converse with our friends I would bet that the place doesnt have a DJ all the time though"
1,"Treachery Seek it out

Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single PF Changs Ive had the misfortune of being dragged to

PF Changs is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food They bill themselves as a gourmet Asian experience which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local WalMart Everything is bland overcooked and ridiculously priced 

Once youve paid nearly 14 for their orange peel chicken you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice This is your second mistake Sadly the bistro calls you on your bullshit You get white or brownfried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it

Everything seems to be cooked just wrongthings that shouldnt be are too crispy things that should be sauced are too dry things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods all the while you find theres no way to escape the treachery

Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper PF Changs while sounding vaguely Asian is a wholly American creation It was founded by Paul Fleming in Scottsdale actually with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit named Philip Chiang They literally cut out the poor bastards i so that it would fit on the signs better or as I like to believe not scare away the flyoverstateswhitefolk so Its highly Americanized and yes Ive had Chinese food in China but Ive also enjoyed great American Chinese food here to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of wok charred beef listed as one of the saltiest foods in America

The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death From Jennifer 8 Lees Fortune Cookie Chronicles

But not everyone finds the terracotta warriors charming Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant Jim told me pointing at the statues Its not lucky Its something you put at a burial site But in America they think its a Chinese thing From a Chinese perspective PF Changs is decorated with death

Which is just fine because everything there tastes like death anyway"
5,"As a frequent traveler into Scottsdale I was looking for something new and different to celebrate with a young up and coming professional baseball playerwho happens to be my nephew We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastros which consistently has excellent food 

Michael Dominick opened Dominicks Lincoln Avenue Prime Steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small but excellent Scottsdale Quarter Ill admit to frequenting this Nike store in travels to Phoenix The ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse The rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers Very opulent without being ostentatious 

We both ordered the bonein filet which is an excellent aged prime cut Supposedly according to our very professional server this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving My limit on steak is typical 68 ounces and I ate my entire meal making me think 1 This place really is THAT GOOD and 2 I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving 

We started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest we minimized the veggies ordered Ill go back during baseball season   

After ordering a glass of of the extensive but reasonably priced wine list we looked at dinner entree The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces The house rub was described as cajunstyle but not overwhelming My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat but take away from great cuts hence I went no sauce 

The result was an incredibly great dinner of Bonein filets ordered medium rare no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side This side comes preprepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese chives bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table We finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert 

Excellent steak spot and a welcome highend addition to the Scottsdale food scene

One comment The Branding of the restaurant is confusing Either call it Dominicks or Lincoln Avenue but not both This actually caused confusion in trying to locate this spot and diminishes the feng shui and brand loyalty youd want to keep and associate Qualifier Im not a branding expert and this is strictly my opinion

 I would love to see Mastros try a southwest cuisine spot"
5,Great theatre Super clean and nice sound in all theatres Only caveat I can read the prices on the beverage and popcorn menu sign thing so when I order a medium I want a medium I can see that for 50 cents more I can get the large I just dont want to pee myself when I get caught up in a good flick But thanks anyway
5,"Aaron Has Been My Tattoo Artist for a long time and the quality of Aaron and all the artists in this shop are amazing very cleansterile and safe 

Be Back soon need some work done"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place I havent ventured outside of the teppen tables so my viewpoint may be limited The atmosphere is quite loud and lively but definitely fun It is great for a nice dinner with a group The food is simply outstanding The soup salad and chicken are all excellent but the fried rice is the absolute best I have never had better fried rice anywhere After you have enjoyed the main course get the green tea ice cream I hate green tea but for some reason this ice cream is amazing 

If you like teppen yaki and dont want to deal with the bland food they serve at Benihana definitely give this place a shot You wont be disappointed"
5,"I got to stay here for work and had the best time They have so many pools I would spend my afternoons in the smaller pools and have the pool all to myself It was great They let me send free postcards which was fun too My room was beautiful It was large and had great amenities 

Food was disgusting though I didnt have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week Everything I ordered was gross and I tried it ALL

I thought customer service was finenot great just adequate"
5,We went there yesterday a I enjoyed it The atmosphere was fantastic because they had a tv plus they have a lot of pictures of Man V Food when Adam Richman came here The service is good because they waited for us to order and were very patient   I ordered the Jewish Slider like Adam did but I didnt take the challenge 1 order of Jewish SIiders are 3 sliders The sliders were awesome The meat was tender and really juicy The cheese didnt really make a difference it just added a little flavor but the bun soft and chewy and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup and it was fresh The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar The potato pancakes arent just a creative idea it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside There are 3 reasons why this isnt a normal slider Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes reason number two is the meat isnt a patty and grinded beef that made that slider interesting Reason number three is that the cheese is melted REALLY melted I will go again because the sliders are amazing
5,Bison Witches is a bit religious for me  The hearth is in Tucson but they did a good job of transplanting the same food experience to Tempe Their filling sandwiches offer a sort of primitive bliss with the roughlycut thick slices of bread  best tip is to go with the half sandwichhalf soup their half is really a whole  Their chili is the best thing going
5,Great iced tea Terrific Roast Beef and mashed potatoes Love the biscuits You cant go wrong at Cracker Barrel
5,Wow  This place completely rocks  Very professional courteous and very good at what they do  make cars clean again  The price was very reasonable and I will be back again many times over  Thank you Stewart Detailing  Job well done
1,"I got on the internet and looked at the menu and called in the order I informed Brothers that I had a 3 coupon also and would pick up the perpperoni pizza and sampler and they said it would be 20 minutes  At the register I was charged 1295 for the 895 sampler  I told the cashier that the internet menu had it listed for 895  She just smiled and said Oh we get that a lot but we dont have a menu  I said but its on the internet with your addressweb page  and she said yeh I know we get that a lot but heres our menu  and she handed me their copymachine menu which did not even have the sampler listed  I politely told her that they should take the menu off the internet if its not right  The sampler was 4 pieces each of wings mushrooms cheese sticks zuchinni  The sampler was just like frozen generic small pieces outofthefreezerbag deep fried 
 
 I live near and our family had hoped to make this our weekly outing for pizza however Ill go elsewhere for better food and prices  I also dont like false advertising  

A customers frustration should be a business owners learning opportunity to make their business better  They can learn a lot from their customers"
5,Awesome awesome awesome Our table all ordered a 5 course tasting  and it was amazing The flavors pop in your mouth Very creative chef I dont think there was one course we were disappointed in By the end of the 3 hour dinner we had a total of 21 courses Each one full of flavor making you want more The staff was excellent always there when you need them but not hovering I would definitely go again Pricey but so worth it
5,"If there was a Cantina Laredo in my home Los Angeles I would dine here regularly despite the multitude and variety of Mexican dining options      Needless to say when Im in Scottsdale I often find myself drawn to Cantina Laredo  

From the moment youre in to the moment youre out Cantina Laredo takes excellent care of your tastebuds  The chips are salsa arent filler but a real treat  Their homemade salsas are worthy of bringing in your own jars to export back home  some of my favorite salsa anywhere  I believe they have three different kinds  Their tequila options are wonderful allowing for creative margaritas or a fine neat glass of 100 pure agave goodness  I promise to never use that phrase again sorry Readers

The entrees arent just your common tacoburrito fare  Using juicy meats creative homemade sauces and interesting pairings Cantina Laredo professes its love for Mexican food and culture  reminding diners how lovable these things are

The decor and various areas are all quite nice as well  An excellent complement to what always proves to be an excellent meal

5,It is a 110 mile round trip for me passing who knows how many salons along the way and it is well worth the drive even during rush hour Ask for Ray if you want an amazing hair experience You will go home feeling beautifulhandsome
1,"I cant even believe I actually went to this restaurant  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so  Let me be clear that Im not a food snob at all  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very very much  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama 

The decor was comfortable and breezy  Everything else   not so much  1st its nice that they bring you bread and butter but a sweetly flavored butter  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty and in my opinion contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat  

As it was my friends birthday they brought him a complimentary dessert  Very nice He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolatecaramelfilled cake with oreo crust chocolate mousse topping sprinkled with crushed Heath bar  Sounds good right  Vile absolutely vile  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter  On an update note  it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though    

My final issue was with our young highly attentive server  He was very sweet and wellintentioned  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective  Dont say are we enjoying our coconut shrimp or are we ready for dessert  Unless Ive badly misinterpreted our relationship we arent doing anything together Just a pet peeve   I still tipped him 22 and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk  

oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy quesadilla cup of crab bisque lemonade and glass of white wine  52  for lunch  

Tommy Bahama and I just didnt work out at all"
5,Steve is one of the few shops that can still do a decent flat top  He is in my neighborhood so it is great for me  convenient   Steve is personable and the shop is inviting  I love the hot towel and backvibrator massage  I have been going to Steve for years great service product
5,"I love the Ranch Market  The atmosphere is great the produce prices are very reasonable and the civiche is excellent I never go down the center isles as they appear to be filled with typical grocery store packaged foods  What makes Ranch Market special are the fantastic offerings all around the center isles  

Here is my advice  First make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink its just past the bakery at the front door  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos but only order two because youll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day  Yummy  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and dont forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert"
5,Since the Gilbert location has closed The Tempe location has had more things to offer The staff has really stepped it up on customer service They do there best on helping you find whatever it is your looking for
5,"Wow i dont think Ive ever been in a more narrow place ever 

but it was just perfect in ever way 

They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side you can watch them make your food 
its like the food network but live and you can smell it  

my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier  we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients 

i had the Reuben Pastrami corned beef homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing 

WOW it was amazing for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage it was more sweet than bitter and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery so delicious and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef over all it was very rich but great to share 

My Coworker had the Italian pepperoni salami ham mozzarella basil tomatoes and marinara sauce it looked great he loved it you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes it smelled divine 

we didnt speak for a full 20 minutes just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and omg this is amazing said quietly to ourselves 

all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time just really cool guys i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place 

i cannot wait to come back"
5,"Of the 3 sites  this is the Kindergarten

My daughter is attending here and I simply love it  Shes five and is repeating kindergarten  She attended kindergarten last year early at the encouragement of her preschool teachers who thought she was bored in their classes  We are having her repeat because shes a little young for first grade but this isnt an issue because the curriculum rolls every two years for that very reason  

In her first year  she learned to read write do simple math know all her sign language letters and has more Spanish knowledge than I do  this year they will build upon all of that and take her further

The staff is great and care a lot about the kids  And when issues arise they  work with the parents to get them solved both at school and at home

Its pricey But so very worth it"
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this place Had the buttermilk fried chicken with the mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus and it is to die for Comfort food for sure Not too crazy about their brunch menu because you must order off of that and not the regular menu Their guacamole and warm chips are also a yummy must This is a great place to take out of town guests because there is nothing like it anywhere else
5,Absolutely sensational food  We had the evening buffett I will be driving 40min one way to eat here again  Wow I just really enjoyed my meal
5,I eat here frequently as I stay at the adjoining Hilton when Im in town and the breakfast vouchers are generous The steak and eggs 15 features a good cut of meat I think its a flank steak 2 eggs anyway you want them with corn salsa and toast and potatoes The servers are always amenable to allowing me to change out the sides for lots of fruit I love the mustard available at the table the fact that they have Chilulah hot sauce on hand and will bring out some salsa at no extra cost The staff are pretty attentive  I call ahead to avoid having to wait in the breakfast rush I have also had an omelet which was substantial in size and quite tasty with unlimited ingredients for about 12
1,My office moved to the area so I was driving around and saw the sign  Best Sandwich Um no If you want I can come in there and show you how to cook a Chicken Cheese steak First dont wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy Second put some meat on there It was 50 bun  It should be toasted and crunchy And price a 12 chicken cheese chips and drink was 13are you kidding me For that price I was hoping for the best I ever had Change it up Capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market
5,"Im a big fan of Silver Mine I have been for a long time In fact I would venture to say that this is my favorite sub place Ever I cant quite pinpoint what is so appealing about it to me I do know that it was a dangerous decision to decide to live within a mile of this shop The employees are super friendly the restaurant itself is clean the food is cheap and ohsogood 

Personally I recommend the Pikes Peak or Bust which is a veggie cheese sandwich I love it and have turned into the type of person that gets the same thing every single timeyikes 

PSThey also deliver until the wee hours of the morning and it doesnt get much better than a tasty sub when you have been out and about in Scottsdale on a Saturday night "
1,"Cummings took over the company that we originally used and since they have taken over we have had nothing but problems

I havent seen a single bug in years in my house and as soon as we started using Cummings weve found a bug almost every single day and not just bugs but cockroaches I called Cummings to ask them about why this was happening and the receptionist was extremely rude saying they didnt do anything wrong I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone 

Needless to say I will be finding a new pest control company today"
5,"Andrea is absolutely wonderful Shes petsit for me several times over the past several years and Ive never had a single issue On her first visit she stopped by to meet the animals and go over details with me Now I just call her to let her know the days Ill be away and she arrives without any problems 

Shes very responsible and trustworthy  her copy of my house key broke off in the lock and she called me right away and we figured out a solution She even came by on a day she didnt have to in order to get it fixed  all of this while I was gone  On another occasion my travel plans changed suddenly and she was able to continue watching my animals 

I highly recommend Andrea as a professional housesitter She cant be beat"
5,If you are a tea drinker you have to stop by The variety seems endless as you read over the menu so it really comes down to which tea fits your particular mood at that moment mine right now is the cookie monster which is awesome
1,For the past three months Ive been receiving unsolicited spam text messages from these clowns so regardless of how nice a place this might be Ill never stay with them or any other affiliated property for that reason alone Ive complained to the hotel I was blown off blocked them from my cell phone account and filed a complaint with the feds Sosince the hotel continues to find it appropriate to light up my cell phone at 3 am with spam texts I hereby award them a generous onestar rating
5,I love this PHO and spring rolls and for the friendly and fast service plus its cheap Oh its truly a must try place
5,The waiter got the drink wrong up means served strained without ice not on the rocks but I was happy about the mistake The Salmon melted in my mouth and the bread pudding made me fat for hours but was so worth it  Great atmosphere and none of our plates were empty when taken away  I would definitely go back  Good service great food fun atmosphere  Great flexible hours on a Sunday  GO 
5,"We tried the caviar before our appetizers this time a choice between two types  we picked the Osetra   Caviar is served with mini toasts  minced shallot minced hard boiled egg white minced hard boiled egg yolk capers creme fraiche and Im sure Im forgetting other items served with it  What a treat  

As usual we enjoyed chopped salad fillets scalloped potatoes asparagus espresso butter cake and a fantastic Cabernet

Another A experience at Mastros"
5,"Lolos is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley  Their dining room is very small and sometimes theres a long wait at the door but their staff is always super friendly and there for you if you need anything

Things Ive tried there

LoLos special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles Stupid fries side of potatoes smothered Chynas honey hots which are their hotwings Ivans chorizo and eggs and their banana cream pudding

Their chicken is perfectly cooked  Nice crunchy juicy and very flavorful  Their waffles are fantastic as well but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries  Its a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers onions and chunks of their fried chicken  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered it stays extra crispy under all that sauce  Thats what makes it so darn delicious  Its definitely a meal in itself  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing

Their koolaide are awesome as well  You cant come here and not have their koolaide  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red  My fiance and I have tried their Scottsdale location as well but I feel that the cook at the Phoenix location which is the original has got it down packed  My food always arrive and taste just as good as the last time as to their Scottsdale location the food doesnt taste the same to me  Maybe Im just trippin but thats how I feel  

Overall this place is pretty awesome  I cant wait for them to finish their expansion"
5,Thats Amore is awesome Im glad to see that a nice clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized It deserves the five star ratings the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor Its a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot
5,"When I met some friends for dinner at this restaurant at the end of October I liked it so much that I made a mental note to write something later   Ive just signed onto Yelp and this is my first review

Our group of friends hadnt seen each other for a while   Busy catching up we didnt open our menus for quite a while  I was impressed that our waitress her name might be Mel kept coming back in the nicest way to check on us but didnt interrupt our conversation   She kept letting us know that she was ready when we were  

When we were finally ready to order she asked  Separate checks   Terrific  That was exactly what we needed

I hadnt expected to like the food because I had heard and read that it was all the  highcalorie comfort variety   It was a nice surprise that I was able to get lowcalorie substitutions for the sides that went with my entree

Overall it was a very nice experience"
5,Great food and service It will only be for special occasion for us because its pricey but it is worth it They made us feel special
5,Friendly group Great specialsTry THE BASIC breakfast Its more than enough
5,Im very happy that I called Enterprise Pools  They have friendly service and worked with my schedule when I asked for an estimate  Mike was knowledgeable and quickly determined what the problem was and even told me how I could fix it  He offered service at a reasonable price and never tried to sell me something for the sake of sales  It was definitely a relief to find an honest business man after dealing with sub par service from Leslies for such a long time
1,"I really wanted to like this place  For starters I paid cash for my take out I was owed back five dollars and was told  we dont have enough change So I had to settle for 250 What kind of restaurant doesnt have proper change  Especially on a Saturday night  
     The food  Chicken lettuce wraps had a strange fishy taste Gave up on them after a few bites  Vegetable chow mein  In my opinion a broun sauce is thick and flavorful This one was very liquidy and flavorless  Dumplings were edible at best 
     Do yourself a favor and stick with China Chili"
5,I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible I would highly recommend this place to anyone
5,Unfortunately Out of Business
1,This place has NO clue when it comes to pricing mens items and I would not recommend them at all  I consigned a leather briefcase worth close to 600 and they priced it for 90 giving me a whopping takehome of 40  I understand the need to move merchandise quickly and naturally this sold in a matter of days but cannot fathom why they would not attempt to get more money for the item  I can only assume they did not do their research before setting the price  Consigner beware
5,Tried a little if everything  The bars are worth the drive across town unbelievably good  The bars have a moist short bread crust it is absolutely addictive  The strawberry cupcake was perfection  Cookies were very good but the bars and cup cakes stole the show  Thank heavens it is not closer to home 
5,"This place makes me want to learn German every time i go

I would get my Polka clothes out any day of the week

Great food great prices great atmosphere

The fall months are great to sit outside and enjoy the weather to a Brat sampler  LOVE IT"
5,I love this place OK where do I start Great place to stop in for a quick lunch AMAZING outside grill everything is good Best cheeseburger Ive ever had I dont even like Salmon and theirs is good Good salad bar and salads  pasta tuna etc The pizza and sushi again amazing And they have about 10 different iced teas to choose from Also they have a great breakfast Omelet station and all I suggest the chorizo and egg burritos GREAT outside patio
1,Currently having a liquidation sale but its not really worth the trip  I found that most books were cheaper at Amazon then the sale price  A few were even cheaper at Barnes and Noble then the liquidation sale price  Which just made me say to myself well thats probably why youre going out of business try some competitive pricing  The place is an absolute disaster theyve moved a lot so the sales staff doesnt even know where everything is  Also the place just smells dirty and old its very unwelcoming  Its really no surprise to me they couldnt get customers before
5,Unfortunately I dont get enough chances to come here but Id say I have been here about a dozen times and each time I have never been let down  The beer is great the food is great especially their french fries and the crowd is OK  Yes it is in Tempe and youre stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here  It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer  A must go to place if youre in the Tempe area
5,"Love this place  Bring some patience because the wait is sometimes long and there is little seating  The outside patio is excellent in the fall and early spring

But I gave it 5 stars for a reason  and that is because the awesomeness of the food absolutely outweighs the wait time  I acknowledge that this is a personal choice  but if you go and try any of the sandwiches youll likely agree"
5,"Absolutely incredible It appears the young lad who works here seems to be the goto frontdesk man everyday for this shop He was very helpful and told me exactly what my shoes needed and didnt suggest pricier repair options that my shoes really werent in need of I brought in two pairs of dress shoes one of which I had the heels replaced 22 free shining included and another just for shining 8 and they made them look nearbrand new again I will certainly be bringing all of my shoes in for repairscleaning within the near future to this fantastic little shop


Keep singing

5,"Im a regular at Lux Havent reviewed it out of sheer laziness And its usually laziness that brings me here when I have a major thingie to get done by Day B but I spent all of Day A at the office surfing the Internet instead of working on it I pay the price with an allnighter which I like to start at Lux Damn them for not being open past 10 This is usually the story when anyone spots me here 

Ill grab a small table for myself plug in my laptop free wifi spread out my papers everywhere then go up to the counter for a large and extremely delicious Velvet Latte When its done right theres a perfect swirl of white cream that forms the shape of a leaf on the surface of the caramelcolored coffee Mmm

Since I am ADD I take frequent breaks of course Like every 3 minutes Whenever I hear a strange piece of music I really like that Ive never heard before this happens often I strain to catch part of the lyrics stick it into Google find the name of the band stick it into iTunes and download it Im not making that up Like half my music collection was created through this method The last few bands I downloaded tracks from are let me open up my iTunes Kasabian Feist and the Detroit Cobras Im not even remotely hip enough to have heard of those before on my own"
1,I give this place NO stars They have karaoke which would be good except for the cohost is NASTY The rest of the bar is typical with darts pool and poker The food SUCKS dont bother to go here unless you like being whined at by a wussy faggot at night long I know that is harsh but the cohost really is nasty
5,"This is my favorite seafood place in Phoenix I have loved this place since it opened when I worked at Nordstrom years ago  They have a great happy hour  There are not many places that you can get a 5 cosmo appletini and lemon drop martinisnot many  They are not Grey Goose martini but they are delicious all the same  They offer greta choices from their menu on their happy hour menu as wellof course they have a fabulous happy hour its because its the same owner as Roaring Fork and their happy hour is to die for
Anywaystheir menu
The potstickers are just something different that you would not expectand they are delicious  I love the crab cake too  A guilty pleasure is the bacon wrapped shrimp with goat cheese and the onion rings OMG  I cannot get enough of the lobster tacos too  I could just have the appetizers for dinner  I do often  Also I love the Fuji Apple Salad because the candied walnuts just make you want more and more and morethe dressing just tops it all off
Now the entrees that I love are the Crab stuffed shrimp with the vinaigretteIt is FABULOUS  Of courseif you love lobster tail this is the place to get it  You get two of them  Now make sure that it is the right season because they are not cheap but they are so worth it
The sides to get are the twice baked potatoes truffled mac and cheese and sauteed spinach  They are fantastic"
5,I am for out of town and came here to celebrate my Birthday and it was a blast The food was delicious and our Tepenyaki chef Robert was hilarious and very on point This place is definitely a must when going to Scottsdale I do go to Arizona a lot and will definitely be back soon
5,I had several mothers tell me about Eduprize and how great it was I was a little nervous when I was told there is a waiting list and you have to agree to put time in the classroom Now that I am in the classroom volunteering I realize why it is so great I can see first hand why my daughter struggles in some areas and does great in others I can see how the others are struggling too and I can be apart of helping them even if it is just for a day This schools requirement to have parents volunteer is something ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD DO
5,Im married to a Japanese and work for Japanese company Ive been to Japan I dont know how many times and have eaten well there This is simply top class Id even say special The style is a kind of fusion ranging from basically pure Japanese to Japanese with some very tasteful western inflections Im not in Phoenix often But this will be on my list every time I go if I have anything to say about it
5,I love their menu  The garlic mashed potatoesamazing  Steakmelts in  your mouth  Service  great  Big fan of Applebees
5,Yes it is probably as good as it gets for a SANDWICH place Very tasty All 3 of us liked our different sandwiches I also ordered pasta salad but it really was not any good but it does not matter as i did not come there for a pasta salad Real good besides that
5,"I am proud to say that I sent Kristin S here for her awesome hair transformation 8 inches is a lot girl I just had my second hair cut here today and I was just as happy this time as I was the first time around First of all the service is top notch  they take care of you quickly kindly and enthusiastically They are not snobby which is a welcome relief when living in Scottsdale I have always felt welcome and comfortable here 

Moreover the prices are amazing I have very easy and basic hair and they charge me 45 for a hair cut  if you want to spend more you certainly can but I am fine with the stylist level who charges 45 In Tampa I paid more like 65 but I much prefer Par Exsalonce This place is a well oiled machine and they know how to run a salon They carry BB products which are fun every once in a while

I really love this place and will not look for another hair place in the Valley This place knows how to treat customers style hair and create a pleasant experience The Market Street location is a bonus too because you can even do some damage shopping when you bounce out with your new do"
5,"How could you not love this place  Not only is the food fantastic and consistent it has a great atmosphere and an adorable grocery shop next door  Its a great place to people watch  Dont forget to check out the wine sectionnot only is the wine random its affordable and a great conversation starter with all the cute names and labels

After moving here from San Diego Ive been so unimpressed by all the breakfast spots in Phoenix  This is the one place that I LOVE  I think it offers something for everyone however my go to is the Venice Beach Burrito  Its such a casual spotyou order from the counter find a table and wait for them to call you to let you know your food is ready to be devoured  Theres tables both inside and out and you can peruse the store while your stomach rumbles


The only thing Ive ever been disappointed by is the sangria but then again Im not a huge fan of white sangria  I will not be ordering it again but I have girlfriends that love it

I had never been here for lunch until this past weekendit was always my late morning brunch spot  Technically I believe its a pizza place but Ive never had a pizza  Although they look quite good  I ordered their tuna sandwich this past weekend which came with a side of fruit and pickles  The bread was thin and grilled panini style and the tuna salad definitely did not disappoint"
1,I will never go back to this establishment because all of the bouncers and wait staff are unfriendly unprofessional and disrespectful
5,"I think my fellow Oreganymphos would agree this is single handedly one of the greatest places on earth to gorge yourself with some of the most delicious pizza pastas and desserts AZ has to offer 

If you wanna take my word for it dont even look at the menu and order my usual orgasmic order

Appetizer Calimari
Dinner Big Rig Pasta w Chicken 
Dessert White Chocolate Chip Macadamian Nut Pazookie

FYI Whenever your taste buds feel like going on a culinary roadtrip make sure you hit up any of the various Oreganos locations located around the state my personal favs are the Flagstaff and Tucson locations"
5,Best chocolate ever  I tried Leonidas for the first time in Europe and have been looking for it ever since in AZ  Im so surprised they opened a store here would recommend it in a heartbeat  Also staff was very friendly a great place to get gifts  I just got an assortment of chocolates and was very happy with my choices The banana creme was surprisingly good and so was the champagne flavored
5,"We have been here several times and each time has been excellent Our first time was in Hawaii and we were happy to see one in phoenix 
        Me and my Fiancee had a four course Valentines day dinner here Dinner was great  Food was timed right and our server was on top of it   Our server sent us a personal handwritten post card thanking us  Dinner came to be a little over 200 with drinks so yes its pricey but my fiancee and I loved it so it was worth it"
5,Back when I lived in Phoenix this was one of the only places I bothered with eating at Started by a Chicagoan who moved to Phoenix they get deep dish right and make just about everything else in the style of delicious I was in town last week to hike the Grand Canyon and stopped in Man I miss their food Thank God I live in Chicago and can get something similar Be warned though Their food is BIG
5,"Consistent offerings of service food atmosphere and drinks is what makes this franchise successful 

No matter whether Ive been to Fogo in DC Baltimore or here in Scottsdale I get the same gutbusting food and wellmade drinks in a place where I could either wear a suit and tie or jeans and a tshirt

A specific note on this particular location there were a lot of families with small children on this particular Friday night No judging but Ive never seen that at any other Fogo Fogo back east is really date night or the kind of place to pregame for a bachelor party or a business dinner but not to bring infants and toddlers Possibly a byproduct of its location on Scottsdale Road in a strip mall near a few hotels IMHO this is not the place to bring kids but I respect the rights of anyone to do so If I was traveling w kids in tow and I didnt have a Fogo in my city itd be hard to pass up In any regard it did not bother me in the least I was too wrapped up in my company and the food and those drinks 

You will easily spend over 75 per person here including tip so prepare to camp out eat slowly enjoy your meal and be treated like royalty

The house special sirloin will make you rethink how to prepare sirloin at home its that good Dont fill up on salad at the salad bar you can do that at Olive Garden but do enjoy the cheeses mushrooms vegetables and cold cuts which raise the salad bar Did you see what I just did there

Nice wine selections here Ask for a Brazilian red to enjoy with your meal if you have the coin"
1,"Let me first say if I could have given 0 stars I would have

My wife and I went to this place and were EXTREMELY disappointed We had gone to a different Panchos many years ago and were hoping it would be like that The choices were very very limited and basic There are so many amazing Mexican dishes yet my only choices were a tamaletaco and some horrible tasting enchiladas How does a Mexican food place not offer burritoshave you guys heard of a bean burrito Its pretty popular and would be a good choice to offer

The only food here that is worth eating is the baby churros and the Sopapillas which actually were good Unfortunately I didnt go to this place to pay 20 so my wife and I can eat Sopapillas 

Please listen to my advice when I tell you to avoid this place Take your money to taco bell and get a lot better Mexican food at a fraction of the cost"
5,"Their frozen drinks carried me through last summer They have free air for your tires and water for the radiator at every location Ive ever been to Their hot sandwiches though greasy arent TOO greasy and actually taste like food The coffee is pretty good and they have more ways to tart it up than Starbucks does QT frickin rocks

And BTW the QT stands for Quick Trip"
5,North Glendales cool new  hangout  Formerly Cactus Willys  Completely remodelled  Follow us on facebook at Justin Willys
5,Very good place for breakfast and their pies are to die for  Weve been here about five times and they never seem to be crowded which is a shame  Their staff is always friendly and the food is always good  Its like a Dennystype place but I think the food tastes better  Ive honestly never had a lunch or dinner item but I dont think thats what you go here for   The prices are very reasonable  Once again pies are TO DIE FOR Weve had their strawberry pie x2 pumpkin pie peanut butter chocolate pie and most recently their mixed berry pie  Were going to be moving across the valley and Im actually a little upset this location wont be coming with us
5,The best breakfast place bar none  I love that it is a local nonchain place and they do everything delicious  The french toast is to die for and the plain and simple eggs bacon potatoes is perfect  My husband and I split these two dishes and it is plenty  We always leave stuffed  Be sure to make reservations for a Sat or Sun morning breakfast otherwise youll be waiting at least an hour
5,My husband and I eat out a lot and we had the best dining experience ever the other night We sat at the bar with the bartender AJ and he was such a delight We had happy hour which was probably the best deal in town 5 dollar glasses of wine and half priced appetizers My favorite was the steamed mussels We loved it so much we also had dinner The classic pasta deal was the best Getting to take one home gives you at least two more meals the next day Its hard in this economy to get more bang for your buck but Maggianos they are doing it right We will defiantly be back for more
5,My dear love and I went to the museum on a romantic date and had such a lovely time I hadnt been to the museum in years and it was a lot of fun to see some paintings I remembered from my childhood like the Frida Kahlo They firefly room is utterly transporting as well Frankly I dont know if it was the art or my dear love that made the evening so wonderful but we will go again soon I strongly recommend a strolling date here Wednesdays and maybe one other night are free Oh and heres a tipif you cant find a space park across the street at the Viad Tower Its free if you exit from the north side
5,"This is a great dog park  Plenty of grass to run around on and there is always a good crowd to play with  And drinking fountains and places to sit  The majority of the dogs are nice but there are a few Scottsdale poodles who think they are the shit and their owners just ignore their bad behavior  I just stick my gum in their curly hair and go on with my day

The best part of the park is when I get home and the dog takes a nice long nap and I can do chores in peace"
5,I was told to see Greg after a local shop diagnosed my exhaust problem  He took a few minutes to look at my car told me what I needed and what it would cost I went back a week later he did the work in the time he told me it would take and there was no surprises and my car is doing well I would recommend this place over ANY muffler shop Plus you support local business and not a chain
5,"My experience here was awesome from start to finish  I was greeted by an extremely friendly smiling man I believe to be the owner who helped me with my order decision took my order then asked me to please sit down be at home  Awesome

I inquired about the salad and asked if they put any feta on the salad they dont he followed up informing me the sauce they serve has dairy but that he would substitute garlic sauce instead now this might not seem like much but to someone who has food allergies like myself having someone with intimate knowledge of the ingredients and the care to make sure they dont serve you anything that might not agree with you is really a blessing and gives you assurance when you eat there  Huge bonus

I had a half chicken shawarma and  half gyros plate which came with hummous salad rice cucumber substituted instead of pita since I dont eat wheat nice touch and a side of garlic sauce  I do not normally enjoy chicken shawarma but he insisted I try  Well he was right I will say now I love chicken shawarma Aladdins chicken shawarma  Their gyros was awesome too homemade not the typical Kronos Meat Cone variety  

I paid after my meal and was welcomed back with a handshake  Service was awesome food was awesome and they were able to easily cater to my picky food needs  A"
5,"I am disgruntled by the reviews I have read about Sapporo  I have a few things to say

1  I am tired of people complaining about the prices at Sapporo    When you compare price vs quality you will always be in a favorable position  If you cannot afford Sapporo perhaps you shouldnt eat there I am not trying to sound arrogant but you truly get what you pay for   Sapporo consistently prepares the best  sushi I have had in Arizona

2  I understand wait time may be an issue  I suggest that you arrive early and anticipate a wait  Honestly is thirty minutes on a Friday night going to bother you  The food is well worth the wait  

3  Please stop wearing flipflops and bathing suits  Perhaps this is the reason you are experiencing rude service  A pair of jeans and a polo is fine  

Sapporo is a Phenomenal restaurant  In my opinion Sapporo serves the best Sushi in Arizona"
5,Falafel is outstanding here dark exterior with green interior and a nice spicy peppery taste that is satisfying  Cooked just right too for texture  Fries are a nice side  Prices reasonable here plenty of parking and a few atypical sodas available in the fridge  Note that theres just a few seats inside since this is also a grocery place  Togo will probably be my main strategy for this great Falafel destination
5,"When Im casual but want to feel NYC I go to Christophers  We go here for a special occasion dinner or on the fly happy hourwhich is the best HH food in town  Let me repeat that  best in town  

Hamburger with truffle fries brick oven pizza or a perfect salmon salad plus a beer or glass of wine for about 10person Cant beat it  Sitting at the open kitchen makes me appreciate the setup and organization required to run a restaurant as well as the chefs tatts  If you dont want the blaring heat of the brick oven dont sit at the corner next to itPhoenix is HOT enough in the summer so cool off and let someone else do the cooking"
5,I love this store  They have an amazing staff and the most modern clothes  I set my appointments with a few of the employees and I always get compliments on my outfits when I go out  Hats off to the Ted Baker team in Scottsdale Fashion Square
5,"This is our neighborhood restaurant

Whenever I want Margarita Sunrise and desserts I went to Switch I never disappoint"
5,"The Phoenix Art Museum was a day well spent The atmosphere was inviting and it was like around every corner was a surprise waiting to be discovered Admission was free for me How you may ask Our local library has cultural passes for various museums try checking out your library next time you go The museum was inexpensive adventure that took me across the world 
 All the different exhibits kept me intrigued and interested There were paintings drawings photography and sculptures galore There were even some animated pieces I even stumbled upon a piece you could actually walk through The layout of the museum is very easy to follow as they give you a map and everything is labeled You can go from the Asian culture to English within a matter of feet It is mind blowing The whole world seems so much smaller and its brought together so beautifully 
 They offer guided tours or you can walk around by yourself There is also a childrens section to the museum I have nothing bad to say about the museum itself I am extremely happy that I went and would recommend that anyone go It would be a great date or family day or even a day by yourself The Phoenix Art Museum is a place that I think everyone should visit while in Phoenix It will really open up your eyes and make you think"
5,"As much of a sweet tooth that i have dark decadent chocolate is my weaknessToffee was never my thing never on my mind 

And then i sampled Goodytwos toffee wowzer 
Sweet and salty toffee is regoddamndiculously good seriously good 
They have a toffee topped popcorn these gals are killing me oh oh the twozels sinfully delish magical pretzel mix with kettle corn nuts and chocolate 

Listen you cant put a price on happiness ha ha 
Everyone i love is getting their stockings stuffed with a box of saltysweet love from Goodytwos

Nothing more delicious or sexy ya sexy then a salty sweet combo it is a heavenly pairing Goodytwos has perfected thisworth every penny 

Rock on ladies "
5,Doesnt get better than this the guys at the Chandler Mall location do it right every time
5,Whenever I start leaning toward being a vegetarian like my daughter is I remember the smell and taste of that scrumptious meltinyourmouth filet mignon at Durants And the hot fudge sundae for dessert Dang just cant beat it The bartenders are old schoolnot too aloof not fawning just professional and classy The best
5,Got to love the concept coffee art and a cowork space friendly for startups  OSP has that feel of old college dorm meets painters loft  The coffee is good the WiFi is fast and the staff is friendly and they dont harass you I couldnt ask for more to get work done
5,I came here on the opening night when someone from Gin Blossoms played on a makeshift stage the beers were 25 cents and there was no food but you know me we ordered a pizza from a neighborhood pizza place Since then they have added a full kitchen and the food is amazing chicken strips that were designed for diners who appreciate tempuralike batter and are over the age of four the beer is astounding one word Kolschmakes me swoon and the people are great Its worth the walk wherever you end up finding a space to parkeven better ride your bike over like we do The Sunday brunch is great All of my friends sit and wish they had a student loan that would enable them to spend at least half of the day drinking here daily I dont blame them
1,"One word to describe Over Easy disappointing 

It wouldve been an OK breakfast place if it wasnt for all the hype Ive been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners Driveins and Dives so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal I purchased it right away I made my own omelette with chicken garlic and spinach The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal It just didnt seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network

The icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice their iced coffee They couldve given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldnt have tasted any different We couldnt wait to get to the car to get some gum to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didnt help After reading other peoples reviews it looks like they hardly had any caradmom so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee

Sorry Over Easy you were quite disappointing"
5,"As a regular shopper of Last Chance I must equally love The Rack I am a cheap shopper so Last Chance has the lower prices but like I have said before the product can be a bit beaten up 

At The Rack it is a much more relaxed environment way more organized and the staff is so much more help full I usually like to shop for shirts dresses and jackets here They also have a great selection of shoes underwear and pants all a bit out of my price range though Last week I found the greatest find I found the best pea coat ever It is black with double buttons and a belt not too long and it has pockets in the perfect place The best part it was originally 160 their price was 5995 AND all their wool coats we 25 off Score Now I will be warm in this Arizona winter Haha 

Check them out The parking lot can be crazy this time of year but what parking lot isnt There is a rumor that Santa is stationed right outside the store as well "
1,Ive been here 3 times  The first was fair so I gave it another shot second time fair again third time kyoto was closed soooo let me start by saying Ive been in the service industry for awhile  I know the difference between good and bad service  If they had been busy this would be one thing but there was us and a few people at the bar  NEVER HAVE I WANTED TO THROW MY BURGER AT SOMEONE AS MUCH AS OUR SERVER  The server was an idiot and the food was ALL burnt medium burgers are not CHARRED on the outside and RAW on the inside  Steamed veggies are not CHARBROILED asparagus everything was so horrible  We didnt complain but we did ask about the charcoal that was our veggies  Which we were given a crappy attitude in response  We werent even looking for it to be taken off our bill just a recognition that the food was TOTALLY burned and half our orders were wrong BTW there was no offer made either to fix anything  in times like these SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE AND QUALITY  CONSISTENCY will get you through   if you dont know what a good meal is and you want to think youre cool cause you hang out in a place that looks like it was furnished by IKEA you should try it  There are better places to spend hard earned money
5,I thought this place was outstanding The staff was awesome the food was excellent overall appearance of restaurant was nice
5,We have been back several times since my initial review and the service and food have been consistently excellent for both lunch and dinner Love their green chiles
5,Great beer Good atmosphere Non annoying music and great wait staff make this my favorite place to spend an evening
1,"Can someone please tell me why people go here

Went to breakfast with Deb L and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies The place was packed probably because its a holiday week

That doesnt excuse the EXTREMELY poor service We sat down and waited And waited Servers walked by every few moments nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order Finally we both said something to a girl who walked by She seems mystified that there was a job to do With that many people working getting a cup of coffee shouldnt take 15 minutes Yes 15 freaking minutes

Food Mediocre at best I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it The English muffin didnt seem to be toasted The eggs were ok but nothing great The home fries My 9year old niece could do a better job My burps right now arent even good enough to brag about

Im sure if the service had been better I wouldnt be so miserable right now My food coma isnt satisfying I will never go here again Ever I felt stupid leaving a tip it was THAT bad 

Total Fail Blech"
5,"Holy crap is this place good  With the gazillion milkshake flavors to choose from I had vanilla kinda anticlimatic I know Next time though  The burgers were huge with 20 some odd topings to choose from I had onions and pickles I know another let down Next time I sware  Also the onion rings are tops here Fries looked good too

The decore is a nice 50s diner type with very friendly staff  Outdoor seating is nice when its not hot out and its very close to the theatre which makes it the perfect stop before seeing Mama Mia JK on that one Saw Batman"
5,I love this place Food is ALWAYS fresh cook correct and service is great Not to mention their lunch specials My husband and I always spend less than 20 bucks and get full and satisfied EVERYTIME
5,"Ive eaten here twice and both times enjoyed myself immensely

  First note that this is the smaller location the one in Mesa has more tables and space This one is closer to me so this is the one I go to but if you are looking to have a large group you may wish to go to the Mesa location

   That said I really like this one The mood is very raw because of the small size even at a table you can see the cooks behind the bar hear the clatter and clang of the kitchen That said you can still have conversations here without issue you just have a bit of background noise

   The food thoughthe food is spectacular Seriously look at that menu look at those pictures The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant of course but still phenomenal and the pasty just made it that much better I also snagged the bananoffee pie It could easily provide dessert for two people I ate the whole thing It was just that good Not too sweet very bananay

   Eat here Its really that simple 

   Also as a tip theres a parking lot round the back that is usually not full unlike the one on the front And though the address is off of University Drive the front is really facing Hardy Threw me a bit the first time I was looking for it"
5,"Great Italian food with portions designed to share

And it was a good thing our waiter brought that to our attention he must have heard our comments on the prices  We ordered 2 half portions and one full lobster ravioli a brick of lasagna and something else I couldnt pronounce and it was just enough for the 4 of us  After the alcohol we even kept the bill under 100  I would definately recommend this place just be sure to bring a few friends and an appetite"
5,Sometimes things happen and when they do this is the place where you want them taken care of The orthopedics department and trauma department have some of the best and nicest Doctors youll find in the state
5,i absolutely LOVE maxim and i have eaten there approximately 2 times a week since i learned about the restaurant a year ago  the atmosphere is pretty awful but the food is amazing  i get a 86 which is a noodle tofu and vegetable soup the broth is meat based  it is comforting and cheap and always improves a bad day  everyone i have taken there has enjoyed the food as well though they tend to enjoy the vietnamese dishes more than the chinese ones highly highly recommended
5,Pet smart did a better job at grooming my dog than my last mobile groomers They cut and wash my dogs hair just how i like them Service was nice the young ladies were always helpful since two dogs on a leash can be difficult I shall return to get my dogs groomed here  Would recommend
5,If you are looking for a great location for bulk specialty flours and grains beans Freeze Dried fruits vegetables meats and dairythey have a wonderful selection They also have water storage and emergency supplies like solar ovens Im a big fan
5,I was looking for a place close to where I live for eyebrow waxing and I was referred by About Face Salon here  According to AZSpaGirls About Face are the eyebrow experts but they no longer offer the service  They were great about squeezing me in the day I called  Angela was fantastic she worked very quickly and with a very light hand  She is so good with the wax that she doesnt need to tweeze at all which for me is always the worst part  Granted I dont have very um complicated eyebrows  She was very sweet and for 15 I will be returning to her
5,Now open on Saturdays Yes
5,Ive been using mineral makeup for a couple years now and Bare Escentuals is the best in my experience You can order their stuff online as well and its free shipping after a certain amount but I like being able to ask questions and compare things side by side before I buy and the salesgirls are always really helpful with that Once I find a product Im loyal to then I do the online thing This stuff just feels much better on your skin and doesnt clog your pores It seems like an initially pricey investment when youre first getting started but mineral makeup keeps much better and I can use less of it to achieve the effects I want
5,"When I say a certain food contains ingredients such as blue cheese and bacon what comes to mind
No Im not talking about a salad Im talking about an ice cream sundae

Sweet Republic is an awesome little ice cream parlor located in a strip mall in Scottsdale Arizona This amazing place makes all their ice creams and sorbets in house Sweet Republic makes some pretty creative flavors These are just a few examples of what we sampled

Basil Lime Sorbet
Salted Butter Caramel
Apple Pie
Dessert Honey
Maple Pecan
Almond Buttercrunch
Cashew Turtle

All of these flavors were wonderful but there was one more that really got me all hot and bothered and that was their Honey Blue Cheese Thats right Blue Cheese ice cream When I first saw it I did not know what to think but after my first lick I was hooked It tasted just like a sweet vanilla  honey ice cream with blue cheese crumbles mixed into it I know it sounds weird but this ice cream is phenomenal It was sweet tangy and somewhat salty all at the same time Instead of just enjoying this ice cream alone I decided to make my own blue cheese sundae They have many toppings to choose from including bacon brittle When all was said and done my creation contained two scoops of their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream topped with a salted caramel sauce bacon brittle and a homemade marshmallow that was toasted with a blow torch This sundae was exploding with flavor Every bite was crunchy salty sweet tangy and delicious 
My fiancé had a waffle cone sundae that contained Salted Butter Caramel ice cream Almond Buttercrunch ice cream salted caramel sauce brownie bites and a homemade marshmallow Hers was also amazing

The service and prices here were both great The girl working the night we visited allowed us to sample as many flavors as we wanted and was really friendly and patient with us The prices here are similar to  Coldstones 

Im absolutely in love with Sweet Republic and would seriously make a special trip to Scottsdale just to have their ice cream I shouldnt be telling you all this for fear that you all would think Im a pig but I liked their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream so much that after I finished my sundae I ordered a Honey Blue Cheese milkshake to go It was so yummy"
1,Soggy flavorless pizza served on unwarmed ceramic plate Carbonara was watery and made with cream instead of eggs Gnocchi was tough as opposed to light and airy
5,Special Not on menu Chicken strawberry raspberry blackberry blueberry goat cheese salad with raspberry vinagerette This was THE best salad Ive ever had and probably top 5 best meals in my life
5,Good food at a good price
5,I went with my sister 2 days ago It was my first time eating Famous Daves I got a hamburger and got some mac  cheese They were both okay I tasted better Now the hot wings  onion rings were better the place was packed we sat outside
1,Water park is OK  However the parking lot has ZERO security  No security patrols no cameras  My catalytic converters were stolen off my truck in the parking lot at Big Surf Tempe today  Sawed right off in broad daylight  According to the cops car break ins and catalytic converter thefts happen frequently here  BEWARE  The water park management doesnt give a shit  Even the cop laughs because they always say the same thing  Our camera is broken but its getting fixed next week  What a joke  If you go have someone drop you off  Youve been warned
5,"So I have to admit that I once threw up in the Pita Jungle bathroom but it was not Pita Jungles fault  it was definitely something I ate the night before  It certainly made for a memorable first date experience with my now husband and we have been back many many times

Oh how I love Pita Jungle  I havent tried anything that I wouldnt have again in a heartbeat  currently I am hooked on the Potato Pizza  yummy

Their breakfast options are wonderful  definitely try it on a lazy Sunday morning  There is usually no wait

The ambiance is fantastic casual and arty with a little bit of crunchy granola thrown in

A for vegetarians and meateaters alike  

Eat hummus and pita  Try falafel  Try anything on the menu because it is all good"
5,"I absolutely love their personal hotpot room 
I tried it for the first time Sundayand went back Monday again
Their item portion is big and fresh 
Only downside is that there isnt any sauce that is premade
Other than that this place is AMAZING"
5,"Ive gone back a few times since my last review Every single experience has been fantastic The burgers are pretty good BUT do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin OMFG Sooooo freaken amazing 

Also their onion rings are pretty much perfect 

And the fried cheese curdjust get it I was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd but holy deliciousness"
1,Absolutely awful these guys have NO idea what they are doing
5,"Great pecan apple pancakes  Superb decaf coffee  Servers and counter staff are bright and smiling  Restaurant was clean  I have already recommended it to another foodie

IF you park in the public lot just west of the restaurant on 3rd street and eat within 60 minutes it is free of charge to park"
5,"I LOVE LOVE me some Joes real bbq  They have the best ribs in town and their bake beans are amazing  Theres little pieces of meat mixed in with the beans and its sooo good  Their mac and cheese is great as well as their corn  Pretty much everything is great here  

The first time I went here was when I first moved out to AZ back in 2006  My fiance took me here because he knows Im a bbq fanatic and I swear I though to myself What is this place  A cafeteria  I did not expect the food to be any good at all  Well was I took quick to judge  Taught me never to judge a book by its covers again  Even though you get in line pick up a tray and order your food like you would to the lunch lady in HS the food is the best  They even have an outdoor seating area with trees and lights  It makes you feel like youre at a nice park having a nice bbq

Joes is hands down my favorite bbq joint in the valley  Nothing tops this  Anything you order is amazing

Oh and try their chocolate chip cookie  Soft and melty and so so good"
1,Do not go to this car wash I dropped my kids off at choir and thought Id run in for a quick car wash Oh no They locked my keys in the car I couldnt get OnStar to unlock my Suburban because it was under a huge canopy and couldnt get a signal Instead of calling a locksmith the car washers tried and tried to get in through the window Thankfully my husband was able to leave work early go retrieve the kids from choir practice and then come rescue me at the car wash with a spare set of keys I was trapped there over an hour  The manager then had the audacity to get mad at me because I was upset at their incompetence They didnt even comp the car wash  If you go here dont pay for your car wash until your car is done
5,What an awesome sushi place I highly recommend How do You roll if you want some sushi done quickly and freshly and without wait what a novel idea I want to thank the manager Amanda for taking good care of me cant wait to come back again
5,"Love the atmosphere the patios drinks and especially the chicken lollipops  If you havent tried them they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat  The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record books

I am also a fan that they serve breakfast 7 days a week and have free wifi  This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game  Not too stuffy but nice enough that it isnt just labeled a bar"
1,"i called them and they wanted to charge 30 for fingerprints  What a joke  I found a place on the other side of the air park who did it for 10  Caveat Emptor  If if could give them a zero rating I would have

On the other side of the airpark off of GreenwayHayden loop is Global Pi Security  10 for prints Their address is 7807 East Greenway road suite 9 Scottsdale Az  globalpisecurity dot com  Good luck"
5,"So my husband and I went to to Bomberos for happy hour Neither of us consider ourselves wine afficianados but we know what we like I told the server Tim that I wanted a heavy red and he delivered It was a wonderful malbec that had deep fruity flavor and a nice hint of vanilla It went very well with the chocolate dessert that my husband and I shared 
In the reviews I see that many people complain about the bread and the bruscetta I have to say that it was wonderful to have a bread with bruschetta  that did not destroy my gums after eating it The bread was flavorful soft and didnt feel like it just came out of a toaster oven The toppings were very tasty especially the Tapenade  the Chimmichurri and the Brie with fig 
Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance the food and not having to valet the car on Central Avenue"
1,Just called at 945 to ask when they were open until Woman said they were already closed but website says open until 10 pm Really Obviously dont care about patronagemexican is a dime a dozen in the new NEW Mexicono thanks Next
5,"Ive been a fan of La Bocca for a long time because it served the needs of an underserved demographic on Mill Avenue Canteen offers many things that La Bocca doesand more What is that demographic exactly Late twenties looking for something chic and classy without paying a ridiculous premium for those qualities Mill has plenty to offer for the ASU kids and the older adults but for those of us who lie somewhere in between places like La Bocca and Canteen are just right 
Canteen one ups La Bocca in fact because there are menu items included in happy hour 50 off most drinks and select food items Here are the highlights
The margarita Its a real margarita Its not a lime daiquiri masquerading as margarita Loads of sour mix does not a margarita make
The chips and salsa Both fresh and delicious The pico de gallo is particularly fresh and delicious
 The ribs Sweet and spicythe level of heat from the habenero is perfect and the meat literally falls right off the bones
The ambiance Its chic but not pretentious My friends and I really enjoyed the Latin music Our suggestion would be to emphasize that music and minimize the clubby stuff it verges on Scottsdale
To contextualize some of the other yelpers comments I was glad to hear that one yelper didnt find Canteen suited to his beer and Jaeger shot needs Theres a bar or ten down the street for that For the yelpers that found the portions to be too small I suspect they didnt understand the Mexican take on tapas that the taco menu is going for in fact the whole valley suffers from a lack of tapas locations Finally the service complainsmy service has been cordial and attentive even when superbusy Folks this place is new lets let it go through its growing pains before issuing such harsh judgments that might jeopardize the success of a really wonderful place"
5,Beer is awesome first timers must do the beer flight sampler and I have never had a meal that wasnt excellent   A quick note there isnt ac in the building so keep that in mind during the summer months  although that doesnt stop anyone from going the place is always jumping
5,Loooove this place Yes its pricey but good sushi usually is The guys making the rolls were friendly The atmosphere is nice Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldnt get enough of the spicy shrimp roll Seriously try it You wont be disappointed
5,No rake no annual membership or fees  Just a fun home game in a strip mall minutes from my parents house  They have 12 and 23 NL games and the min buy is 40 max is 500 Everyone is friendly and they offered us snacks and drinks while we played  Since there isnt a rake or fee dont be cheap like one guy there and tip the dealer generously
5,Talk about an amazing experienceFirst off the office is well decorated and cleanthe staff pleasant and helpfulRene the hygenist is caring and gentle  Dr Keith is really personable and excellent at what he does  They dont do extra work that doesnt need to be done they are very honest  The office takes many kinds of insurance and they are great with kids too
5,This has got to be the best barber shop Ive ever been to in my 38 years on this planet  I was always getting terrible haircuts at places like Great Clips and Hair Cuttery when I lived in Virginia Beach and I just assumed it was because I naturally had jackedup hair  After getting my first haircut from Israel the barber not the country I know Id have a hard time looking elsewhere  I dont know if these dudes were ever in the military but their attention to detail is top notch
5,"There are so many good things for me to say about this place that I have no idea where to begin

The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go The small intimate bar area with quite a few pretty men is lovely on a sunny day out while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date The menu is so great carrying lots of new age food items quinoa black forbidden rice bowl kaleand lots of dishes carrying local food items It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarianvegan menu items One time I tried to order the woodfired vegetables and the waiter swore it was vegan As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what vegan meant We ended up having to call a manager over

The cocktail menu is so interesting its hard to decide what to get My favorite is the Dark and Stormy which has ginger beer the BEST cocktail around IMO Do not pass up dessert The bananas foster is amazing Not traditional but good in and of its own"
5,We had a great time Had bottle service with Katie who was super friendly Our drinks were never empty and that was nice because we were celebrating a birthday The music and atmosphere were great
5,So yummy  I got the low calorie yogurt with all kinds of yummy fruit in it  didnt even feel guilty  Such a fun place to go with friends or as a nice dessert after dinner I cant wait to go again
5,"Ive been meaning to try this place for months and Im so glad that the temperature has finally dropped to less than 100 degrees so I could take advantage of the outdoor patio for lunch 

The service was kind of slownot sure if it was on purpose so I wont knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious Got the chicken goat cheese bacon apple pesto foccacia and would def recommend it Everything tasted really fresh A perfect lunch spot "
1,"I am leaving this store angry and cant resist writing a review 

The staff is incredibly uselessif you can actually find someone to help you The store is huge with very little signs to guide you Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for even though I tell myself I will never go back with no one to help me 

Today they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said well you can call them I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive"
5,"My sister was leaving back to Texas and I decided to find a BBQ place that may have a similar taste and feel I found this place through a Mesa newspaper ad

Anywho as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good We parked in the back and walked along the side where you can order your food to go As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line I was already eyeballing other peoples plates I could see the ribs and at that point I couldnt decided on a plate but went ahead with the plate that had everything

I ordered Ribs Pork and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven So I didnt even hesitate because every since Ive moved here from Texas I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste Needless to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered

The chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldnt accommodate Which is offered on the side Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter Superb The Mac and cheese was super duper great

In Texas we have bbq joints in every corner I have tried it all and I will have to say this is one place I would have on my top list if we had it there

BIG bbq sauce thumbs up for this joint"
5,Always good food and good service Best gyros around I know I always get speedy service so I can eat my food and not be there for hours
5,Excellent food Agree the sizzling rice soup is a must try I had chicken pad thai 5 of 7 spicy level because I like spicy food Great you can request spiciness level on each entree
5,I have been here 3 times and find it unique to Phoenix with a country French ambience without being cutesy The patio is one of the loveliest we have here in Scottsdale My daughter and I celebrated an early Mothers Day here recently We were seated in just the right spot on the patio to tuck my grandson and his stroller in a corner next to the table We splurged on some white sangria for lunchso pretty it had its photo posted on Facebook The Brie and Carmelized apples also came with grapes and strawberries and it was a very large serving of cheese It could easily be a meal or feed 4 as an appetizer We actually ran out of bread because the Brie wheel was a nice large serving The smoked ham sandwiches on crusty baguette are so good that I am craving them a few days later we used the stillwarm gooey Brie on them too This place is just special Plan an event take a guest It is a spot that will make it memorable This was my first lunch as a new Grandmother with my daughter My daughter is from the beach area in SCal and she was wowd Thanks for the memoriesbeautiful day
5,"Just got back from lunch here and I must say it was delicious We sat outside on the patio which was very nice on such a pretty sunny day I had the beef gyro which was huge and so so yummy It came with a fresh greek salad and a yogurt sauce and I couldnt have asked for anything more

Definitely recommend coming here"
5,We went here for my wifes birthday and its a rare 5star review for me They scored on food presentation service and atmosphere We sat indoors  its a bit hot out still  and loved the decor including the fun pillows on our large booth seat Service was prompt friendly and attentive  but we never felt rushed They make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango lime and rum flavors The kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared And after having some disappointing lobster in Maine of all places the Maine lobster here was done just right  firm but not tough They serve it lazy style and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly A special birthday souffle topped the evening off Expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion
5,"I agree with the other reviewers Ink bomb is definitely a shop that has a family vibe All the tattooers are down to earth and have you their customer in mind There are usually 3 or 4 tattooers there giving you a wide variety on technique style and experience all of which are important when picking your tattooer I suggest always going in and having a consultation and looking at each persons portfolio to choose someone who fits your style whether it be New school or Traditional   This shop has on open layout and a friendly vibe which allows your to let your guard down a bit because we all know tattoo shops can be intimidating
I will definitely be recommending this to all my friends and family"
1,New N Scottsdale location Baaaaaaad  The were 10 staff members milling around and there was no manager on sight  1000 for a mediocre burger with an uncooked tasteless bun not large enough to encompass all the arugula  They forgot the sauce which apparently is the main ingredient  The upgrades are ridiculous  100 here for cheese on an already well priced burger btw Flemings blue cheesebacon burger 6 best in town 500 here for fries  Cmon  And its the same two hispanic guys who dont have any idea about chef inspired food cooking in the kitchen as every other restaurant there is no chef For the price you want to see the chefowner representing especially at a new location and you want competent staff who treats you as 1 and not their conversing with the other staff members as 1 and you want to enjoy what is supposed to be one of the best burgers in town  What a disappointment  The lack of top down management care and supervision carries through in all elements of the poor experience  Take a pass
5,My goto restaurant for very tasty genuine Thai food Great lunch specials  Favorites from the dinner menu fish cake tom kha soup pad thai hot basil Thai iced tea
5,"HELLLLLLLLO GOLFERS   What a sexy course this is   This ranks up there with some of the best courses Ive ever played and THE BEST desert course I have ever played    Yes its desert links style golf but youre in the desert so what do you expect  Its kind of a trek but itll be worth it   From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave youll enjoy the service and scenery  A real private club feel

As mentioned earlier this is DESERT LINKS GOLF   No adjoining fairways and all the crap plays as PGA desert lateral   The fairways are pretty wide for the most part so you can spray the ball a bit but there is definitely some carry involved on some of the tee boxes  Hole 18 is a very hard core par 4   Long carry on the approach to the green with a TON of water along the right side of the fairway and green   This is the kind of hole that can ruin a good day on the course real quick   Dont be afraid to lay up      Oh and there are mens ratings for ALL the tee boxes Id recommend higher handicappers play from the forward tees because this course could be really hard if youre a mediocre golfer 

Maintenance was perfect even in September after baking in the Arizona heat all summer   The fairways were well manicured and not too hard  Nice rough but not too tall   A slightly errant shot will be caught but you wont have to worry about searching for your ball for 5 minutes either   The greens were also perfect   Nice and fast and TRUE

Ok Im done gushing about this course   Give it a shot you wont regret it"
5,very laid back very clean This was my first piercing since I was a little kid I had my tongue piercing it was very professional and they answered all of my questions I went to this place specifically because of the good ratings they had online My friend also had a tragus piercing here that went seamlessly also I felt very safe and comfortable
5,We tried this last night for our date night  We were impressed  The waitress was amazing in explaining the menu and making suggestions This is a great place to relax and talk  The food was great  I had the TartifletteWOW it was so good  My husband had the La Potence which is their speciality  He thought it was greatWe will be back
5,Best breakfast in the valley Dinner sucks Well lets clarify a bit here Weve ordered blueberry pancakes stuffed french toast muffins and a few other bfast items They were all stupidly good For dinner weve tried a couple dishes such as the recommended jumbalaya  SUCKS Stay away from that canned garbage Back to breakfastdang thats incredible
5,"I heart Sky Harbor Airport Parking

Of course its always nice to find a ride to or from the airport but when youre all out of favors and you have only yourself to rely on it comes down to driving yourself or getting a taxi  Sky Harbor Parking to the rescue  

For 8 a day or cheaper if you print the coupons from their website the folks at Sky Harbor Parking make it easy to drop your car and get to your gate in no time and Ive used them a handful of times solo and with the BF so I know its doortodoor consistent service  

If you are interested in covered parking call ahead but otherwise just drive over to Washington and 40th and they will take care of you from there  Also I recommend calling from the airport once you have your bags and they are always good about picking you up within minutes to take you back to your car

I hope youll find Sky Harbor Airport Parking as useful and convenient as I do safe travels"
5,I LOVE Konas happy hour Amazing deals on great sushi rolls and the diner can always count on fast and friendly service I am always happy with my experience at Kona and find myself comparing it to other sushi restaurants None can compare to Kona Kona is the only place that offers my cherished Skinny Cucumber Mojito and I come here often for it I ask for this drink at other places and am always shocked that most dont even offer a skinny option let alone the cucumber mojito I have dined in the Scottsdale location as well as the Cherry Creek location in Denver and both have equivalent high marks in service and food quality
5,"Wanna try it Now is your chance One more day of this LivingSocial deal 12 days for 49

5,Love love love this place  Great appetizers and cocktail menu  Must visit in Old Town Scottsadale
5,I love this place I just tried the other Ethiopian restaurant in the Valley and was disappointed and my gratitude for Cafe Lalibela multiplied The food here is fresh and authentic and the staff are really nice Im so lucky to live down the street Tons of vegan options too
1,"I wrote a less than stellar review about this place some time ago and decided that my prior awful experience might have been a fluke and as I love great BBQ decided to give them another go   I was right the first time

As before the food was hohum at best the prices too high vs the product quality but the death blow to me was once again their customer service or shall I say lack of customer service

We had to ask the bartender if we could get a drink Thats odd and all the wait staff acted like they were doing us a favor by waiting on us

To top it all off they had little to no air conditioning so it was brutal to sit through a combination of bad food crummy service and high heat

For me this place is officially off the books and we sure wont be back Lesson  1 Your in the service industry try and acy like it

As a BBQ fan Ill try elsewhere "
5,"I been to many stadiums and this is one of my favorites I attended a game against the Atlanta Braves and it was a great experience

Food prices are typical for any MLB stadium but get the combo meals and it seems cheaper The bigger the beer the cheaper it seems There really isnt a bad seat inside the entire place Get there early enough and you can go down tot he bleachers during batting practice to catch a homerun hit The staff is very friendly and talkative

If I lived in Arizona I would get season tickets The merchandise pricing is pretty cheap too compared to most stadiums 23 for a hat compared to 41 at Dodgers Stadium"
5,I enrolled my 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter into Hubbard Theyve completed 2 swim lessons each and the results are dramatic They have made huge strives in their water skills Plus it seems to enable them with confidence and self esteem after each lesson
5,You want to go to Four Peaks Trust me
5,We went here once a week for the year my husband was in grad school   The food is a 4 but the waitresses are a 5   It was a half mile from our apartment and so we would walk there and walk back to work off the huge portions    This is the only restaurant in my life where I could consider myself a regular   We never really talked with the waitresses or knew their names but they always knew what I wanted I didnt have to order  They always gave me water with no ice no lemon my husbands with ice and lemon gave me my panang curry with chicken medium and waited for my husband to choose what he wanted He probably ordered most of the items on the menu  They refilled my rice if I ran out without asking  Our bill always came to 1953 for dinner more times than I can remember  We went maybe twice for lunch but almost always for dinner  My husband graduated last month and we moved from Tempe but we miss this place dearly
1,Groupon ripoff Small salad three extremely small plates of mediocre pasta desserts that cloyed the palate All for an advertised value of 90 Will NEVER return
5,Dr Kanarish was exactly how I expected he would be by the other reviews I read on Yelp and Google His staff was very friendly and the facility is extremely clean I have an 8 year old Boxer that needed a large tumor type growth removed from his paw and was given very high estimates from different hospitals Phoenix Mountain Animal gave me a very reasonable price on the initial exam and the actual removal stitches etc ended up being much more affordable than any place I had called I was originally offered care credit a payment plan but I ended up not needing it because the bill was within reason I just picked up my dog and he was a little sleepy from the local anesthetic so we will see how the next few days go A great first experience and am planning on transferring all our future visits to see Dr Karanish Its great to see there are honest and compassionate Doctors around I hope anyone looking for an exceptional Dr will consider Dr Karanish
5,"I first saw them Saturday morning at the Phoenix Public Market and told myself that I would have to try them soon I was too full from all the sampling with the different vendors My coworkers and I went to check out the food trucks that gather on Thursday outside of Whole Foods by Raintree and the 101 I saw that Mojo Bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food

I decided to get the Red White and Kale salad I love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out I went with the Coco Coca The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there The total came to 13 not too shabby considering the portions I didnt even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling definitely a meal in itself Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette The salad was delicious The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didnt have a taste so if youre not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad The portion was huge it was good for 2 meals 

I try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses Mojo Bowl definitely brings those two together for me I cant wait to try more of their smoothies and food out soon"
5,Went here and we had a groupon The ambiance was awesome Two stories down you enter a cozy space We were a few minutes early for our reservations and we hung out in the bar Table was ready and I ordered the lobster dinner It was delicious and they cracked it table side We definitely will be back again
5,First off I am not a Cubs fan  But I came here to watch them play the As during spring training and thought this park rocked  Its cozy enough get within heckling distance of the players but it has a lot of the amenities of Wrigley Fieldincluding Old Style beer and florescent green hot dog relish  All this and sunshine too  Whats not to like
5,"we rode our bikes here today in search of a new place to try the online menu looked like it had a few options for nonmeat eaters although it is very much a meat heavy menu 

for an easter sunday lunch it was very empty not a good sign but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing 

the decor is country but not like cracker barrelmore like neo farm dining 

i had the blackened fish sandwich which was cooked really well nice and seared but juicy topped with onion pickles tomatoes and butter lettuce i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heatnothing to burn your mouth 
my wife had the tuna sandwich which was also tasty and seared just right she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable but it was her dish not mine her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful 

i would love to come back here and hope they are able to make it here well worth the bike ride"
5,"Id leave my Scottsdale bubble for a few reasons and yes there are additional exceptions

1 Nobuo at Teeter House
2 Fez
3 My friends in various parts of the valley

and 

4 Mekong Supermarket

I consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine Chinese Japanese Filipino Korean Indian You name it Ill eat it I have my healthy moments but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate

Mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses The aroma and sensations from the exotic product The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head and then cut up and packaged The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar 

This place has it all

I usually come here for my Asian condiments and live seafood Want a live crab Boom Done Want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap Its yours

To me there is nothing like taking the 10 mile drive in traffic to Mekong because I know I am going to get everything I want 

Make the trek You wont regret it"
5,"Okay I will start out by saying that I just picked this place out because it was near a bar we were going to afterward  Boy Howdy am I glad I found this little gem  Upon entering I was overwhelmed with the idea that we were in an Italian friends grandmas circa 1980s dining room  It was quaint  It was old school  It kinda made me a little nervous

The general feel of the waiter we had was extremely laid back  Traditional Italian dude who was a little tardy in checking back etc  Our water glass was NEVER refilled  Got a little more nervous

They brought out really good looking bread and poured some herbed olive oil out for me I declined because I have celiac disease and cant have regular bread  My husband said the bread and the olive oil was amazing  I had called ahead and they said they had many gluten free options

I ordered the Chicken al Berto  My husband ordered veal and a side of spaghetti with meat sauce  We started with a Tomato Caprese appetizer  The tomato was slightly under ripe but the mozza and basil made up for itand in the center was a bunch of roasted red peppers which totally made the dish  Nom nom nom  The balsamic was excellent as well  I must now do peppers with my Caprese

Then our entrees came out  My chicken had fontina cheese pancetta and spinach  There was a little line of mushrooms in a marsala sauce which Im not sure if it was supposed to be there or not  Im super happy it was  This is close to if not the BEST chicken dish Ive eaten  The chicken was moist which is usually questionable in Italian restaurants Ive found  The quality of the Fontina cheese was impeccable  The pancetta was crisp and plentiful  Then I tasted the mushrooms OMG  Freaking amazing  I may have to try the Chicken Marsala sometime just to have more mushrooms  Divine  

It took a while to eat mainly due to the waiters chill attitude but we shall go back again and again and again  I dont care if you dont get anything included with your main entree  The portion of entrees were HUGE  My husband loved both his veal dish and said the meat sauce was one of the best hes had  Fresh fresh fresh

Its on my new list of first priority restaurants  And I think the prices were pretty good  Less than 15 for my chicken 20 for the veal and 10 for the Caprese  Im so there next week

Oh and put your phone on vibrate  They kind of insist  And thats okay too"
1,I found Lisa Gs while driving through phoenix with a friend The exterior looked promising and we prepared ourselves for a treat We were in for a a shock We ordered the antipasto plate and while there were serious issues with it it turned out to be the best thing we were served I ordered the chicken rolatini the special of the day and it was just plain bad The chicken was dry and under seasoned the Rosemary potatoes were soggy  and the veggie medley  squash corn green beans etc was over cooked and the juices spilled over into the potatoes It was one of the worst 17 meals that I have ever had My friend ordered the veggie salad and it was one literal hot mess Just horrible food I see that others had the mini burgers and bowl of balls and found them to be tasty I wish I had ordered those As it is this is one place I would never revisit or recommend to a friend
5,I just celebrated my birthday at Oreganos  I had the best server I have had the pleasure of meeting in a lonnnnng time  ASK FOR ALEXANDRA  Knowledgable adorable attentive funny and charming to boot  Amazing pizza and salad fab cocktails wed never heard of and todiefor dessert  All per her recommendations  Cant wait to come here again
5,OMG try their breakfast burritos  Habaneros has good cheap fast Mexican food
5,Went there last night with no expectations From the beginning to the end including the bread basket with blue cheese butter and pesto on top the lamb chop appetizer the sea bass entree and the creme brulee in a flaky phillo cup lightly burnt on top it was probably one of the best overall meals Ive had in years Thanks Eddie for stopping by our table and checking on us and chatting a bit Very friendly wait staff and no attitude whatsoever from anybody and very comfortable This place is a model for how it should be done
1,"I purchased the Enotria groupon when it was released last year and had a horrible experience at the restaurant

1 I ordered a cheese platter The platter was very much overpriced at over 1800 The most problematic thing is that Enotria ordered the food from another restaurant on Mayo Blvd and had it delivered to them The same is true with Pizza If you order pizza there it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it AVOID THIS

2 Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon We ordered two glasses of red wine The waiter who also happened to be the owner served us a glass that was 13 of what is typically served

The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines To be sincere you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill

Oh also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago It has changed ownership several times and the overall quality is suffering because of this

AVOID"
5,"Husband and I have been trying to go to Urban Cookies for a while now For one reason or another we kept missing its store hours We finally made it today and boy were we glad 

I had a vanilla cupcake and he had the urban cookie which has chocolate chips and walnuts The cookie was the perfect balance of moist and crispy 

The guy behind the counter told us that the vanilla cupcakes was a special but when they rotated it out people yelled at them After taking one bite I totally understood why The cupcake is the best Ive ever had The vanilla frosting is not too sweet perfectly creamy and melts in your mouth 

I just hope they get more business so they can expand their hours"
5,"3 stars on any given day my server PAT made this a fun experience and was the extra 2 stars  Pat is one of the few people in this world who really enjoys being good at what he does  I asked him how long and with much joy he replied I can get your food in 1015 minutes  Sure enough it took 9 minutes  I value time and in my business my word is everything  Pat understands this and when I eat here again I will insist on his table  I recommend you do the same  ASK FOR PAT

Top notch Pat  Dont ever change"
5,"Five stars is truly deserved For Yasu This is truly the best sushi in town and some of the best I ever had I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of chain sushi places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi you need to go to Yasu There is really no way to describe it till you go but once you do you will become an instatnt fan 
Best thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants You wont be disappointed 
The area and building are misleading However if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it this is probably not for you This is real sushi
Go try and enjoy"
1,"please please please do not stay here 
i never do these reviews but i feel obligated to save someone the time and money and self respect by writing this review the customer service is soooo soooo poor after having almost 50000 held on my charge card after i checked out i called to find out why this charge was on my account  i was hung up on and after calling back was repeatedly hung up on and refused to provide his name to me or his managers name i told him i work at a four star hotel and casino in las vegas which i do he called me a liar  and as of right now still out 50000 what establishment hangs up on their guests this guy should sit through some of the forbes training i have received what if i was a shopper 
do not stay here save your money they only received one star because you have to provide a rating  
aside from the horrible customer service they stuck me with a 50 penalty fee when i had to change locations that wasnt great but whatever the pictures do not resemble the motel the game room is not a game room  its a room with an atari in it  the pool was small and dirty and if you like noise all night while you are trying to sleep you can count on it here  all these things i could get over however the customer service the man i cant even say gentleman on the phone was horrible and penalty should follow he is an embarrassment to all of us who work in guest services 
do not stay here you would have a better stay in a box outside on a corner
i should have known better for such an inexpensive place but i was hoping if we cut back on the hotel we could spend extra money with the kids doing activities and going places wrong you get what you pay for and worse"
5,"Chicken wings and cheeseburger meal Yummmayyyy

ever since ive moved away from arizona i can honestly say that china grill is what i miss most their chicken fried rice is really good and so is their cheeseburger their general tsos chicken extra spicy is my bfs favorite almost everything is good here"
5,"I cant really say enough about Liberty Market The place is beautiful comfortable friendly and the service is awesome I havent had anything that I didnt like From the wood fired pizza to the delectable salads everything on the menu is worth every penny For me though its all about the Cortadito espresso drink and the pastries These are completely off the chart awesome You simply MUST try them

Another great plus to this place is that on just about any given day you can visit and see Joe the owner hanging out chatting with customers and all around having a great time Joe is truly one of the nicest and most sincere people I have ever met Makes Liberty Market all the more worth visiting

Oh As weird as it sounds you have to check out the bathrooms they are the best I have ever seen seriously"
5,Michael came out today and he was great Our patio door was a bear to open and he put new hardware on and voila It seriously opens with 1 finger He was quick affordable knowledgeable and very nice Scheduling was easy and the office staff was kind A
1,I had such high expectaions after reading reviews but I was so disappointed  The food was not good the service was awful  They got all of our orders mixed upo Will never go back and cannot recommend this place  PS  one dish was good and some enjoyed the soup  There are 100 places I will visit before returning to this place
5,"Where else can you go in Chandler the will transport you to another country for free in a flash

I like to shop here and explore the foods of other countries  This is not just an Oriental Supermarket they are a World Market  Each aisle jets you to a different culture or country

I wish most of all their sake selection was better but oh well they are bound by the limitations of their distributors

I will be there again soon for a ministaycation"
5,"This review is pretty much for the bra department at Nordstrom They are amazing at their jobs I finally found out that Victorias Secret is that their bras suck 

So I bought a bra online to pick up at the store but when I went in and tried it on it didnt fit I thought that sizes for that brand ran a little differently I told the sales girl and she asked me if I minded if she measured me I said sure and she followed me into the dressing room 

When we got in there she told me to take off my top Ill be honest here I thought she was going to measure me over my shirt and I almost peed a little I decided to pretend like it was no big deal to take my top off in front of a total stranger and just took it off Not sure if she noticed my slight hesitation but she probably did oh well I generally like to go on a couple of dates before I take my top off if you know what I am saying

Well guess what That is the best way to get a good measurement it turns out The salesgirl told me to wait a few moments and she would be back with some bras She came back with two of the most wonderful comfortable and supportive bras I have ever owned So instead of getting one bra that day I got two

I have to say my hat or my top is off to Nordstrom for training their staff to be great at their jobs and for having fabulous bras 

Ladies please dont bother buying another bra at Victorias Secret Run to Nordstrom next time you need a quality bra to support your girls "
1,If you want a school that cares more about your financial aid money than you this is the school for you Education is horrible If you are a democrat dont speak your mind you will be considered a reject from day one I got 100 on my graduate papers and think I did not contribute anything to the fields This institution is a joke
5,"I was there last week with my sisters and while we ordered our steaks cooked medium all of them came out well done Kind of disappointed but oh well

So last night my fiance and I had a buyonegetonefree coupon so we headed over When I ordered my steak cooked medium I asked her to make a point of it when she put the order in because of the issue last week

When our food came out she asked me to cut into my steak and make sure it was cooked the way I wanted I did and while it was a bit more mediumwell than medium I was hungry and it looked good so I gave it the go ahead and we started our meal It really was a good steak

When our waitress came out again she double checked that my steak was cooked correctly I assured her it was fine A few minutes later a manager came out and apologized for my steak being over done and offered to replace it I assured him it was maybe a little overdone but it was good and I was happy with my meal They were being very nice and showing some great customer service though a little overzealous 

When the bill came they had made my steak the free one for the coupon even though mine was the more expensive of the two meals we ordered

Great customer service and very good food"
5,I love sprinkles cupcakes I have also managed to go to every location except the 3 in so cal Like every location the taste and quality is consistent and delicious I got the salt caramel banana and carrot this time around Like always its delicious and lasts for as long as they say it does My pup loves the pupcakes too I would wait for these cupcakes any time
5,My favorite place by far and well worth the drive from Gilbert Love the atmosphere bruschetta and of course the wine Great place to catch up with friends I cant wait for the location in Gilbert to open up
1,My husband and I went there for our first time today What a mistake First of all the ladies bathroom had no soap or paper towels to washdry your hands My husband had the steak sandwich and I had the chicken ranch There was so little meat on the sandwiches that we were perplexed when we were finished  The inside trash was overflowing I have been sick to my stomach the last hournever again
5,"This place was the answer to my German grocery shopping dreams I thank the Yelp community for leading me to Old Heidelberg I was picking up a number of items for an Oktoberfest party I was cooking for and hosting at my house and was able to fulfill most of my exotic German needs at this one stop I picked up pumpernickel rye bread authentic concentrated Maggi Würze seasoning not the soy saucetasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores and Knorr zwiebelkräuter salat krönung They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just cant find over here for instance  sauerbraten gravy

I stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place Andrea and Chris I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years including Berlin and Bavaria  They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections I promised I would be back especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberknödel liver dumplings I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook line and sinker as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies"
5,Barrio Cafe is a favorite of mine the margaritas before you get seated are a must  When in season the pomegranate guacamole is second to none  A refreshing escape from the cookie cutter chain restaurants  When you go go with friends and dont have a schedule as the wait can be long but worth it
1,"I will make this real easy for you 

Just go to inandout Burger if you dont want to feel gross and poor"
5,Im usually one to prefer chicken  but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it  I ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor  Our lunch crew has gone back several times and the service is always fast and friendly  For the size and price  order multiples  Love the salsa bar  Adding cucumbers is now my favorite treat
5,I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the Phoenix Market I HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD Ive had since leaving the Gulf Coast of Mississippi Red Crab Saladfresh clean sweet crisplightin a very well appointed setting Very  good iced teas as wellhard to find in PhoenixGo thereEat thereyou will like itand we might see one anotherwho knowsbe like nikejust do it
1,The office space layout presentation gets 5 stars the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10 They will scare your clients off scare your own staff and make your life a living hell Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time they will be told to leave They will be told you dont provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image Corporate Office Centers can do this for you BE AFRAID They are dedicated to working against not with you
5,been coming here since birth
5,Well what a pleasant surprise  I stopped by with my children to check it out  planning to eat elsewhere because my daughter eats glutenfree etc etc  Then I met Payton Curry and realized what he and the Brat Haüs are all about  Great food and a desire to serve  Payton delivered on fantastic organic salads that were gluten egg dairy and soyfree and tasted great  And he threw in a few organic surprises  Now I have a place to eat phenomenal Moroccan lamb hot dogs while my daughter can enjoy healthy food  On our second trip Payton remembered us and came out to let us know he had made some falafel in the shape of a sausage of course and offered my daughter one in a salad or a lettuce wrap  She chose the wrap more fun and loved it  I have NEVER had personalized service like this  Cool place cool patio great beer selection greattasting unique food selections and best of all great people  Congrats Dave and Payton
5,It doesnt matter which location you go to its all the same and GREAT
5,Theres the sweetest and cutest guy who works there and one time my total came to 545 i had a 5 in my hand as I was scraping for change in my dance bag but he was like its on me and took it from his tips I know its just 45 cents and i could probably find that under the seats in my car but he truly made my day with something so little like that I LOVE this place D
1,Door clearly says drivethru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight Drove up at 1030 and was told the lobby was closedlame
5,Oooh this is my favorite lunch place by my office  Super nice staff delicious bagels  Go for the lox special thing its amazing
5,BEST PANCAKES We want the recipe Theyre newly remodeled and better than ever Always great bagels but now they have added more menu items more choices Great food great people
5,"I have been trying to get into a consistent workout routine for years Ive tried it all gym memberships pilates training for a marathon but was never able to stick with anything until Karve that is My husband found it for me on here actually and thought I should try it not sure what he was trying to hint at with that but i love my improved Karve body too much now to care 

Anyway I went and am now hooked it is the greatest work out ever  its hard but the results happen so quickly that its motivating and its really the only workout routine that Ive ever been able to stick with ever  and with going multiple times a week I found that it even changed my appetite  I no longer feel annoying cravings so eating healthier is easier for me a former carbchocolate fiend

It really helped me finally get into a more activehealthy lifestyle  I know that sounds so cliche but Im still shocked everyday that a lazyasssweetseating like me is actually working out on a regular basis  and its all bc of the great method of Karve plus the instructors are SO sweet and nicefriendly and supportive Im honestly making friends there all in all a stellar review for Karve Studio im a believer "
5,"Whenever my brother is in town he always stays here so when the hubby  I were looking for a place to get away for a night we stayed here We are the not the party crowd which is why we chose to stay here on a Tuesday after a holiday weekend Here is my take on Hotel Valley Ho The Good The Bad and The Ugly

Good
1 Gigantic comfy bed I slept like a queen
2 Private balcony with large chaise lounge and sitting area
3 Outstanding bathroom The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself
4 Cool decor both interior and exterior 

Bad
1 Bed pillows were too squishy 
2 Toliet paperbath tissue was surprisingly rough I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue
3 The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits but no coffee or tea Not everyone that stays here drinks hisherself into a stupor

Ugly
1 Parking is 15 per day but you have the option to self park which doesnt cost a thing so I guess thats not really ugly

Overall we had a lovely stay at Hotel Valley Ho and look forward to our next visit"
1,"Coffeemeh Not great not horrible
Sconedry
Serviceridiculously slow
The night we were there 811 the owner came and asked a group of people who were clearly having some sort of meeting to stop talking because they were disturbing the guitar player Chased 8 paying customers at least I assume they were paying customers they all had drinks out the door Weird Dont think Ill be going back"
1,"I wouldve gone 2 stars if I were more forgiving I could reason that it was the end of the day that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant But then I tasted it

It looks as if Yogurtini is pretty wellloved around these parts and Im sorry to report otherwise Its was like a bomb had gone off The tables were filthy the machine handles were all gunked up there was assorted debris on the floor The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins with no employees in sight We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles and other customers to try some different flavors The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation and noone attempting to clean it up

The stuff was real overpowering to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be Like cheesecake doesnt taste like that good cheesecake anyway And neither does cake batter or banana Where did the yogurt part go And how do you screw up cookies and cream exactly The two that were the best and most edible were the Irish mint and the red velvet and thats what we mostly ended up with

The decor didnt add to our experience Everything is a mint green but it doesnt come off as retro or even minty but more like dated and hospitallike Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing

A surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register only to disappear again soon after we paid We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance halfmoppinghalfattemptingtoclean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes We finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair

I very well could have walked into Yogurtini at the worst possible time on the worst possible day with all the factors stacked against them but I wont be returning to find out if this was the case"
5,I had the Gnocchi in Shitake Dijon Cream Sauce and it was unreal  Cute little place  I didnt sit to eat so I cant comment on the service but they were extremely amicable when I ordered my take out
1,The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldnt remember what we ordered kept having to ask and still didnt get it right  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos my husband finally said ok time out Im the customer  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues They stopped for a split second all three looked at us then they actually IGNORED us finished their conversation then finished our sandwiches  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked  Good thing I like avacado because it ended up on my sandwich  I didnt order it and after telling the girl she said I thought you said Still had the order wrong  Whew
5,"One of my fondest memories as a child is traveling to Alameda to visit my greatgrandparents one of which was Filipino The food Yum 

It had been years since either my mom or I had Filipino food We both moved to Arkansas 20 years ago but I recently moved to the valley The first time I came across Hey Joe was last Spring when my mom was in town and we visited the Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market Pancit Lumpia I was beyond excited when I saw the truck Yes I get excited about good food

Everything was fabulous I have since tried the breakfast dish which was absolutely delicious 

Service is great prices are wonderful I will definitely be back"
1,"This place was the worst place to EVER live I lived here from Aug 2010 to may 2011 i was always in the office see when the grates would be fixed the office always gave me the run around very rude You would think after the gun shoots assaults and car break ins that they would fix the gates but nope and to this day they still arent fixed When we moved in they said they would be fixed in a week and they lied  Also the gym is huge but NONE of the equipment works living here was SO gross nothing worked our neighbors are Mexican thugs doing drug cat calling at anything that walks it was gross I hated living here 

 But the worst part was a few weeks ago we get a call from collections saying we owe Scottsdale Springs 300 bucks over 10 months after moving out I called them up like wtf and they were SO rude said too bad pay it or your credit score will hurt we even gave a fowarding address and we NEVER got a letter in the mail about any damages They claim we never gave them a forwarding address which is bull 

I really hope people read these reviews i would hate to see anyone else scammed by this god awful company"
5,Thank you so much for the good reviews I went here for a business meeting 8132010 I ate soo much I hurt myself Everything was great I especially loved the lamb and chicken curry The staff was excellent and very kind I will recommend my new favorite Indian food restaurant to everyone 
5,This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants of all time Ive been many times and its always fabulous I LOVE their Mahi Mahi Tacos  they are so good I also highly recommend the Pork Osco Bucco Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast and the Cowboy Beef Stew The nightly specials are often very creative and delicious This place is also good for Sunday brunch Good bartender too  drinks are never too weak
5,"This awesome park and recreation center makes me wish we lived in Peoria We were here today for a FRAG reef tank geeks picnic and the whole area is new and beautiful with lots of different amenities We saw sand volleyball courts a spashground with critters spouting water for the little kids a skate park packed with older kids picnic ramadas fishing areas baseball fields batting cages and a duck pond There is even a Starbucks

We were at the group ramada BBQ pavilion the likes of which I have never seen before It was a huge covered circle of about a dozen BBQ grills with ventilation hoods hanging above and a cement bar from which to serve on the outside circle and smaller cement tables behind on which to do prep work There were also sinks in the center to wash up Surrounding this circle of grills were corresponding ramadas with picnic tables numbered for your group What a fantastic set up 

Great job Peoria"
5,"If you like PF Changs you will love Pei Wei Its essentially the same thing in a less formal dining setting  TakeOut I cant tell a difference between their Orange Chicken or the lettuce wraps minus the price tag
My favorite dish here is the DanDan Noodles Its Hot Spicy  Pure Indulgence Pleasure for under 10

If you have not heard Pei Wei is not authentic Asian food Well neither is Panda Express but Ill tell you Pei Wei is better than Panda Express  most Authentic Asian restaurants in the US 
Yes I said most Authentic Asian restaurants NO MSG

Can you believe the balls on this guy

Well I have had Chinese food in China Towns in San Francisco LA NY Vancouver  Dallas Ive even had Peking Duck in Hong Kong dont be impressed it was not that good I love Chinese food but I really love Asian Fusion Roys PF Changs  Pei Wei really wet my noodle

The other nice thing about Pei Wei is their take out 
I have them on speed dial
So when Im on my way home from work Ill call  as I pull in I pay pick up and go Its freshly cooked  No Wait"
5,"They finally just opened a Ritas location in Surprise I think it just opened yesterday or today but its just as good as the one on Union Hills and 83rd Avenue  I told my coworkers about it and we basically have been driving by during our lunch break just waiting for it to open over the past few months
Its hard to explain the texture of the ice Its thicker than the ice in a frozen margarita yet its not crunchy or unrefined like an Icee drink Sonic has similar ice but I feel like its just not as good as Ritas I guess thats why its Italian ice Its in its own category

There are 3 main types Gelatis custardicecustard Blendinis custardicecustard with mix ins like Oreos MMs etc and Mistos icecustard drink You can also get just regular custard alone or flavored ice alone One of their most famous ice flavors is Swedish Fish Theres also a sugar substitute version of their ice and todays sugar free ice flavor was Pineapple I tried a Red Velvet Cake Gelati today with vanilla custard and it was nothing less than amazing
The menu is a little confusing since there are so many choices There are mainly only 2 types of custards though vanilla and chocolate that can be mixed with the 12 flavors of ice that consistently change 
Before I was solely a fan of ice cream and yogurt Now I am grateful that my sisterinlaw dragged me here because there is nothing quite like it yet Now I will always compare Italian ices to this place"
1,After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years I encountered today a first  a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands It was an issue of protecting the thumbs When I told her I didnt like forearms and elbows she explained that shed never worked without using her forearms and I assume her elbows too After just five minutes when I asked for more pressure she suggested we stop the massage  that she wasnt the therapist for me She was right What are they teaching these people these days and why doesnt an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff I wont offer her name but if considering a massage at this establishment I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money
5,"This place has to get all five stars Ok the area is a little suspect I will admit that can be countered with the excellent food and excellent prices This is the kind of food that goes for 12  15plate if it were located in an upscale area  They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful

5 Top reasons I love La Condesa
  Beautiful food Unique flavors 
  Great salsa bar aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas I liked them all
  Price you can spend under 7 and have a really good meal
  Convelient It is only a 2 minute drive from 24th  Camelback
  Atmosphere the interior and the service create a great place to dine

We eat out several times a week and this place is now at the top of the list for my wife and I both"
5,"LOVE it and so close to home  Since Pita Jungle open in Glendale I have been at least once a week Yes really  The hummus and garlic dip are to die for and on my last trip I tried a Greek PitaOh my  The fruit on the Caribbean salad and the fruit and cheese plate are amazing and the chicken combo plate is so large its two meals

The ambiance is slightly different than the other locations but I think that is mostly due to the fact that two sides of the restaurant are glass  Pita Jungle Glendale still features a revolving collection of art work and you can see the funky style of the other locations in the hand painted chairs and the cool artwork painted in the bathrooms  The staff is also  extremely friendly"
1,While the menu looked promising have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties   Since we were still unable to get her attention  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street
5,Awesome food and service
5,"How did I not know this is right across the street from my house

I woudnt describe myself as a crafter or DIYer but man this place has all kinds of fancy papers from traditional to fun and contemporary I bought these vintage anatomical papers that I plan to make posters from The best part is that they were only 350

They even sell Japanese Copic markers take that Az art supply"
5,Cashew brittle almond brittle bacon brittle  Go now before its too late
5,Delicious gourmet crepes Friendly staff Awesome environment Price is right Eat here its good
5,Upon first look Pearl does not look like my type of place  Trendy locationatmosphere often equals mediocre  food Pearl is an exception to the rule The sushi is creative and tasty and the drink specials rock I love that they have different flavors for edamame cheap bombers and did I mention the fish sticks are way to good All of that would equal four stars in my book fifth star is given to the staff Steve is the type of bartender that others should aspire to be like Knowledgeable and observant without being intrusive Always goes the extra mile I really appreciate how he makes my husband and I feel so comfortable Overall great value and relaxed attitude
5,Excellent Fresh and yummy
1,"When I was growing up we called this the canal In other parts of town it is still called the canal In some places people actually fish from it I think they die right after they eat their catch which is why you dont see them very often Over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well  Google it

What is so annoying about this is that Scottsdale is trying to make it seem like this isnt the same heinous canal thats always been there When I heard about the development around the Scottsdale Waterfront I couldnt figure out what they were talking about What water Then I started cracking up when I found out it was the canal

Come on Scottsdale you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig but it is still a pig You are not fooling anyone"
1,Service was slow and horrible Got the steak and eggs  Steak was half fat Waiters response was Oh  We have a new supplier He didnt take it back and charged us any way Eggs were cold Stay away from this place for eating Bar looked happening
5,This is one of my favorite bars in the area  The bar has a good vibe the food is good and the bartenders are attentive  The prices are reasonable so you can have a good time without digging too deeply into your pockets
1,"Wow I cant believe this place gets so many good reviews 
I was hauled here once by coworkers looking for a cheap meal But how much value does your lunch dollar have when you dont even want to eat the food Dry and sticky rice white meat chicken unidientifiable as such and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor Quite frankly it was disgusting and none of the dishes my coworkers had looked any better though they seemed to be fine with them I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall The one star is only for the fast and friendly service"
1,This was a terrible experience  You can not reach anyone via phone you have to book online which I did and also requested a phone call  I rcvd no call and had an email in my email confirming a time for cleaning  I requested a call then and got a reply stating someone would call me in 15 mins  Still no call  The cleaners arrived  I had someone let them in  When I returned they were to clean the bathrooms  they were TERRIBLE TERRIBLE  The sinks were dirty with tooth paste splatters on sink the inside of the shower had brown marks from some sort of un rinsed product  I am so unhappy about this  I have tried to reach them every day since  have not recieved a call back from a voice mail or email  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE AWEFUL
5,"I had an amazing facial here 
The space is clean inviting and relaxing Park in the lot south of the building it is less crowded 
After an hour of pampering my skin was glowing 
They offer many of different services including laser treatments I will be back for some more aggressive treatments to fix up my flaws not that I have any 
Anyway the staff is very professional 
Before or after your treatment go next door for some great Thai food"
5,"Bliss Delight Contentment words to describe our evening Monday night at Sens I could go into a very fluffy review but with a nod to the simple zenlike restaurant I will only address and highlight 

Spa Like atmosphere  welcomed and enjoyed
Attentive but not aggressive servergreat attitude 
The Bar Menu I expect to see if I go to heaven 
Homemade infused alcohol finally in Phoenix 
Open kitchen I was able to watch the chef CRAFT my meal 

All items served tapas style great opportunity to try many items 

Food is prepared and served to allow the diner to choose the experience either enjoy the food natural or enhance with dipping sauces These are not the heavy sticky sauces of Pei Wei fame 

Mango Spring roll light fresh items in rice paper 2 rolls sliced 

Soup Gyoza 4 little light dumplings filled with pork and a delicate brothdivine 

Volcano Beef sear your own tender beef strips 5 on the hot stone then wrap it up in a lettuce leaf with herbs and peanuts try a dip of the accompanying sauceecstasy prepare to order 2 theyre so good 

Panko Shrimp  liken to little shrimp hushpuppys very good but not the highlight of the evening Mr Chu could improve upon these in my opinion 

 Red Thai Curry  4 unique yummy curry  coconut milk dipped wings perched on a Asian slaw 

Spicy Wontons  Americans will love these familiar flavors with wonderful dipping sauces 

Noone in our party was disappointed everyone was very pleased and anxious to return  

 Personal Suggestion  
Have a food allergy   Use common sense when dining Take personal responsibility and ask questions of your server BEFORE ordering"
1,So the food at this place is good Well the sliced turkey sud But when it came to delivery and internet ordering Oh my god the incompetence of these people After and hour 15 mins after the food was suppose to be delivered the order was 2 turkey subs and garlic cheese bread I called and was told that there was no delivery guy and if i can come pick it up that they would knock off 25 But the foods not ready yet how long does it take to make 2 subs So i pick up the goods and damned if i didnt check the bag they didnt give me the 2nd sub Ugh they never checked the order If you have online ordering  you need to follow though So with a second phone call and a second trip to the place and 2 hrs after the original order i FINALLY get home and eat The only good thing i got was a free lunch  For that I give them a 1
5,I love their beef sandwiches and thin crust pizza It is just like being back in Chicago Love it
5,"Zin zin zin  Yes yes yes
Several weeks ago five of us had a wonderful Monday evening at Zinburger with our delightful server Candace I arrived early inquiring about the Left handed Polestar Pilsner Candace offered a sample very tasty  with three of my party eventually having it with dinner 
We had a great booth  giving us a vantage point watching the parade of customers  employees I really like the airy roomy high energy vibe
With our drinks we had the delicious zucchini fires with two sauces an
a subtle breading on the zucchini
We all tried different burgers with some of us tasting each others Candace made the split arrangements prior to serving us  nice touch The meat is flavorful melting in your mouth with a freshly baked bun
Fun cool atmosphere  great food  made for a great get away early in the week
My hats off to the Sam Fox team another winner at ZinBurger"
5,Visited the restaurant tonight and was very pleased  I found the decor charming and elegant  The atmosphere is amazing sans the hustle and bustle of most of the local chain like restaurants  The place was devoid of the stereotypical Scottsdale element we prefer to avoid  I found the prices easily justifiable in fact I though them quite reasonable  We had the three onion tart appetizer which was spectacular For entrees we had salmon filet and a pair of lamb shanks  Everything was wonderful  The presentation was clean and the freshness and quality of the proteins produce and accoutrements was immediately evident  Everything was cooked skillfully  Had three of the four desserts on the menu  The chocolate raspberry tart definitely stood out followed closely by the berry tart  Delicately prepared and presented these were really an unexpected treat  The environment is wonderful for Dining and chatting with people you actually like The interior is intimate and it lends itself well to the cuisine  I found the staff courteous knowledgeable and professional  We will be frequenting often and I encourage others to visit
5,This place has amazing pizza and great service Ive been 3 times and have not been disappointed Weve come for mostly group events such as bdays and going away parties and you can do family style and share or get individual portions Bruschetta and breadsticks are great starters and I love the signature spinach pizza Our waitress suggested getting it crispy to avoid getting soggy spinach and Im glad I took the suggestion Coworkers got Chicago style calzone with au jus and raved about it Since there was a bday they comped a canoli and gave us an extra one for being cool  pitchers are also half off on Thursdays so 7 bucks for 4 glasses worth of fat tire made us all extremely happy
1,"The staff of this establishment are some of the rudest most condescending individuals I have ever met in my life They will not give you ANY money and you will have much better luck at Sunset Clothing Exchange which is right up the street Plus they actually have friendly staff The people who are buying the clothes should not be buyers judging from the way that they style themselves they know nothing about fashion whatsoever Everyone who has stated that you will not get any money from them for designer items is right they would much rather have trite trendy studded vests from Target than a pair of Miu Miu sunglasses

I was there about a year ago and one of their young female employees was laughing snarking and making faces at me I had no idea who she was It got to the point where my friend actually pulled her aside and said something Today their manager called me something that I cant even print on here I had never seen him in my life either I have never done anything to these people except for sell my clothes to them

Avoid this place at all cost they should change the name to Juggalo Exchange"
5,"Simply the best Ethiopian Ive ever had  Grew up in VA with DC as my stompin grounds home of a large Ethiopian population and even had a good amount of Ethiopian homecooked meals by friends and none was as good as this place  

I go to AZ once a year for work and each time I am sure to stop in  I usually get the veggie or meatlovers meals since they tend to be such a good bargain but have also ordered separate items as well  

The vibe is casual and the service is excellent  The staff have always been very friendly  another reason I keep going back"
5,Very impressed 5 pitcher until 5pm and excellent healthy food at a good value Free valet parking  I look forward to coming back
5,This is what Ive come to expect from Waffle House Great food with excellent customer service My new home store since the one two blocks from my house is run by a cranky sarcastic nonclean district manager Kyle I was told is his name
5,"This place is absolute perfection  From the setting to the service to the food I loved every moment of it  The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp  You seriously are my trusty sidekick  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries
Walking in the restaurant it is quite small but just absolutely adorable  It really does feel like an upscale country home  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect
Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper  Both were absolutely delightful  Then we moved on to appetizers because while getting drunk is fun I was really excited for the food  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top  Put fried egg on top of anything and Im sold  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and Im in love  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare perfect timing  The mussels were equally amazing if not more and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread  Well that along with the bread and butter  But that still wasnt enough for me  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness
After Gina cleared that out of our way she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend  I hate when I dont have a drink in front of me and she made sure that never happened  Then the entrees came  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me  Again absolute perfection on both accounts  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese  Im getting hungry again just writing about it  My bf loved his but I still maintain that mine was better  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at 15 and 17  Could life get any better
Well apparently it could  After we polished off our entrees then came dessert and after dinner drinks  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise  And the berries with the creme fraiche  Heaven in my mouth  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini
This review cannot do this place justice  This is truly a unique experience that is far above any of the restaurants in Scottsdale  Please go in and experience this for yourself you will not be disappointed"
5,"Amazing work

My dentist referred me to this place just down the street from her  I was super scared as I always am at the dentist but the staff made me feel very comfortable  They treated me like a patient at the hospital  They were my angel nurses  

When Dr Amin came in the nurse was holding my hand and telling me when to breathe  I was of course shaking like a leaf  The Dr popped me three times in the cheek and I was all numb  When I say popped I mean it was an electric shock wave pop flowing through my face to my freaking eyeball that made me tear up a little  this was done by the needle of course going into my cheek  It was the craziest feeling but relieving at the same time  I just breathed through it and it helped  After about a min the Dr was working his magic  In about 45 mins he was all done and I had like 4 canals  And I didnt feel a thing  

I was very pleased with the staff Dr Amin and the work they did  I highly recommend this place if you need a root canal done  Plus if youre a scardy cat like me this place makes you feel comfortable"
5,"Just off University but manages to feel like a little hideaway and pulls off an enticing mellow atmosphere suitable for intimate conversation

Fish Tacos and a Margarita again please How many times before I can force myself to experiment"
5,"This place is great Just opened up on central just south of camelback on the west side of the road 
AMAZING gelato and the coffee is just what I need Family owned really friendly staff free wifi flat screen tvsalso just saw a flier for a monday movie nightI guess they are gonna have double features on mondayseven made a specialty drink for the nightsounds like fun

cool little spot dont hesitate to check this place out"
5,"Really  Because it doesnt get any better than this  For what it is and for what its worth this place is truly unique  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place this quaint spot serves up good tasty and satisfying food hot from the kitchen

What is a pasty

A pastys history can be associated with the tin miners in England  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface  Supposedly the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the handles and when done discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines

At the Cornish Pasty Co I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto  Very good flavoring and filling  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef potatoes and swede  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well

Pros
 Good food
 Originality
 Portions
 Customer service
 Coat hooks at the bar

Cons
 Small interior"
5,"Coming from a French family on my moms side it is ingrained in my genes to love cooking food and shops like Sur La Tableoh and also wine and cheesewhat a tough life I live

Sur La Table is a classy cooking shop which offers high end cooking ware appliances and also dishes Somethings in the store can be pricey but you can also find good deals as well They offer many cooking things you wouldnt find at your average Crate and Barrel for more complicated cooking endeavors I have also found some cute cookie cutters here for my moms collection The staff was all very helpful and knowledgeable and many Sur La Tables now offer cooking classes"
5,"These guys have the tacos and nachos thing figured out Great decor and hot hot waitresses 

We had lunch and it was pretty quiet Good service Im sure things get crazy at night though"
5,"Truly a hiden gem in Chandler Located south of Chandler Boulevard just off of Roosevelt next to Archery HeadQuarters Wandas is a small yet quaint twelve tables inside and 5 outside Outside is for sure seasonal as summers are too hot and dead of winter can be too cold Wait times on a Sunday or Saturday can be 1015 minutes during the rush times which is a quarter the wait time you would experiece at the nearby chains The menu offers a variety to satisfy and hunger except if you want lunch on weekends its breakfast all day lunch from 112 during the week The burritos are awesome Ladies I guarantee you will take half home My husband likes the Biscuits and Gravy The bacon is amazing and addicting often I have to smack my families hands away from grooping a piece French toast cinnamon raisin french toast and pancakes if you brought your sweet tooth    Build your omeltes are good too tip add a side of salsa you wont be sorry it is made fresh daily and goes perfect with a ham and cheese omelete Service is exceptionally friendly a lot of regulars and the servers know what you usually drink and sometimes can have your order written unless you throw a curve ball and veer from your usual 
A Wanda"
5,"I have been coming here since discovering them after their opening week last year and I havent stopped coming back The food is predominantly Filipino the FilipinoMexican fusion comes in the burritos flautas and quesadillas filled with Filipino meat dishes A great starter would be the Chicken Adobo burrito Kareys does it right by not dumping rice and fillings inside the burrito theyre served on the side 

For those more interested in rice plates and combinations Kareys serves daily prepared dishes such as Pork Adobo and Chicken Adobo pork or chicken simmered in garlic and soy vinaigrette and Beef Mechado a type of stew with beef chunks potatoes and onions in a light tomato gravy with either white rice or Garlic Fried Rice yummy There are also specials that rotate each day which can be checked out on their Twitter account This is a great idea as one can find out when they are serving Lechon roasted pig Yum

There are dishes that can be prepared fresh but are not part of the combination specials  The ones Ive tried that I highly recommend are their Lumpia fried eggrolls in chicken beef or vegetable and Pancit Canton stirfried noodles with vegetables The pork lumpia was great when they used to serve it and I preferred it to the beef lumpia that they serve nowbut its still good 

Not only is the food delicious but the warmth of the staff is something to always look forward to Karen and Rey make you feel truly at home The best thing about Kareys Kitchen is having a Filipino restaurant in Phoenix and not having to drive all the way to the East or West Valley"
5,"Sundae for Sunday

Pink spot helps me go through the summer heat"
5,This place has a top notch tuna tataki app Great rolls out quick regardless of how busy they are Excellent service all the way around and very reasonable on price Green tea ice cream for after dinner treat I think so I forgot to mention I was in and out during lunch time spending 20 dollars
5,"Half the fun is the waitIf you are going to go you may as well get into it We get into it at their Italian place next door and drink tons of wine L and I later that night had a hot kiss and she lost her precious earrings I even drove back the next day to look for them somewhere against the wall Just kissing but hot if you lose earrings

We went twice once alone and the 2nd time with her sons and friends We ordered every pizza imaginable It seems almost every high end pizza now is brick oven and more about the crust I like everyone else will mention I am from the East Coast and know pizza Best in the United States we have several that are at that level You can flip a coin on which one is better"
5,Love chickafila  theyre pretty pricey for fast food though
5,"Lets face it junk is the antithesis of glamorous  When youve got a big pile of crap you need hauled away any guy with a truck will do right

WRONG  You want someone that will be on time is willing to clean up the area where the junk is after theyve picked everything up is polite and fluent in English thinks of valueadded services like emptying your trash bin and represents a local business that you can patronize

Junk Guys ticked all these boxes for me  THe guys were great and helped me out when I needed some items hauled away from a house that I had sold  Id highly recommend them over an unknown entity or a big corporate junk removal company  So go get your crap hauled away by the Junk Guys  youll thank me"
5,"Nellos is the best  Great local feel great food love this place

You have to have  Gluten Free Pizza Garden Salad with Turkey and House Dressing  It will soon be your go to feel good order"
5,When I was recovering from surgery I received of one of their arrangements It was marvelous The quality was unbeatable with gorgeous blooms and fantastic presentation They lasted for weeks I am really pleased with this company and wouldnt hesitate to use them again
5,I would just like to start off by saying that I love egg salad sandwiches I have probably tried an egg salad sandwich anywhere that serves egg salad Sacks is BY FAR the BEST egg salad sandwich entitled The Dali I have ever had in my life I live in North Phoenix and I will literally drive many miles just to eat at Sacks On top of the wonderful menu whenever you order a sandwich from them the meal comes with a little chocolate chip cookie which is amazing all in itself If you like their cookies you can purchase the cookie dough They also make other delicious dessert bars and salads that are for sale as well I have been eating here for at least 14 years and I hope they NEVER go away
5,"I have found my new favorite sushi spot

I wish it was closer to Tempe but its worth the drive

You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant You know the kind the Phoenix area is plagued with them Hana is BYOB and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu most of it is authentic real sushi 

On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil giving it incredible flavor The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious They made me realize Id never had a fresh gyoza before every one Id eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven

The sushi came out fast even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday The first thing I noticed naturally was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray Hey fire I thought It was a nice touch

Then I saw nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe a small pile of what looked like pickle relish I guessed what it was and our waitress confirmed it it was FRESH wasabe

Real freshgrated wasabe is something most people never experience Most people dont even know the pasty green stuff thats standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green The real stuff is just too expensive and too difficult to keep on hand But there it was no extra charge It adds a little spice and a wonderful fruity complexity to the sushi 

The sushi was great They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes youd expect but I didnt try any of them Next time"
1,Wellno worries for the continued bad serviceawful pricesaverage inventoryand just overall bad experiencebecause the store closes forever this weekend I have never cared for the placeso I definitely wont miss it However if your looking for some decent electronic gear at 6080 offthen this is your weekend to go Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends
5,"This little taco shop gets 5 stars 

The fish tacos were out of this world breaded and fried to perfection I also tried the al pastor taco that was marinated well and you can taste the marinade in every bite I also tried molotes for the first time The cilantro salsa and red salsa was homemade and oh so good and spicy The quesadillas are like cheese crisps I am so disappointed that I did not find this place earlier since its so close to home 

I have to try the other items in their menu soon Price is very reasonable as their tacos range from 1150"
5,"I like to think of Trader Joes as a specialty foodhealth market It is simply in a league of its own when compared to large commercial grocery chains Honestly there is no comparison 

With that being said this is the BEST Trader Joes I have been too and I have shopped quite a few in my travels across the US The sheer size of this store in TJ standards is IMPRESSIVE  The isles are plenty large enough for TWO people with carts to maneuver through  And more importantly EVERYTHING looks fresh and delectable  

Some of my favs are 

399 Trader Joes Coastal CabFABULOUS for the price Quite honestly though I havent EVER had a bad wine at Tradersthey have an amazing selection that isnt overwhelming but isnt sparse either I also LOVE that they CLEARLY label each of the wines andor regions so they are quick and easy to find 

The Haircot Verts French Green Beans are simply delicious Their Brussel Sprouts are the perfect size and quantity just enough for two people at two different meals  They even have Nulaid Ready Egg ie egg beaters for 369 At the grocery store the SAME stuff will cost you TWICE that 

Their cheese selection is delightful with almost ANY kind of cheese imaginable Their artesian breads are so yummyalthough not a low fatfat free food so that is a once every few months splurge and even then we only get the small loaf which I want to say is called a little bastard That name CRACKS me up 

And although I am not a sweet eater my hubs isso he has a dozen or so goodies that he constantly gets here The one I can think of off the top of my head are their Chocolate Covered Joe Joes with Peppermint Crumble or something like that Id go look at the box but we are fresh out because the hubs thinks that eating one box over a twothree day period is acceptable 

It also fun to be rewarded for bringing your own reusable bags as any good ecofriendly shopper would do There is a weekly drawing for a TJs gift card I think the value is 25 and you get a ticket when you bring your own bags not one for each bagjust one ticket for bringing them to put your goodies in Then they draw a name out of all the tickets which you drop in a box on your way out of the store once a week  

If you shop more than once a week you can earn a ticket for each time you shop there in a week therefore increasing your chances of winning although I am PRETTY sure the majority of SurpriseSun City Grand shop there so maybe the odds arent THAT great 

Regardless this is just a great little market through and through I used to get excited to shop at TJsnow I am always looking for an excuse to buy something just so I can go there and its not just to try and win the gift card eitherthats an added bonus"
5,Great Brisket There has not been good BBQ in south Scottsdale for a long time There is now The food is wonderful and priced well Stop in and grab a bite
5,I had initially checked this place out a couple of months ago  Once again we found ourselves needing some quick delicious breakfast and decided to try this place out again  As before it was absolutely delicious  The one thing that surprised me this time around however was the little play area toward the back of the restaurant  This is very impressive to me as it gave us some much needed peace prior to getting our food  Thank you Berthas Cafe for not only being so accommodating but also for having such wonderful food
5,"Feeling a bit weary from a steady stream of travel we decided to head over here for my favorite Rx Pho

A couple of summer rolls filled with shrimp pork and vermicelli dipped in the sweet peanutty sauce a dash of their house hot saucea tad more fire than the cock sauce and we were off to  a fine start I was feeling better already

The Pho arrived and the aromas were simply intoxicating After a short interlude of vaporized euphoria we dug in adding the usual lime cilantro basil sprouts and aforementioned hot sauce Commence slurping

The broth was simple yet complex in layered flavors Noodles were perfect in abundance and texture My companion chose beef and shrimp and declared they were cooked perfectly I selected the special beef which included shank brisket tendon tripe and meatball Outstanding

Service was with a smile prompt and attentive I honestly felt like I was sitting in someones home enjoying what they might eat on a daily basis I do not think that Cyclo can compare while good this just seemed more authentic"
5,"Owner Daniel M is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find Daniel is from South America but you wouldnt know it his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy

Daniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget OK its not Etiennes Different Point of Views list of 4000 but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one If youre not sure just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind  likely he has with a wink a special bottle in the back

When we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine Talk about knowing people One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine who walks by but Jan DAtri Wow Thats another review And speaking of reviewers I also ran into Phoenix Magazines Nikki Buchanan also extremely nice

When Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress name who made a comeback some years later For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale  and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors LOL Again after much hoopla he made it Daniels The current woodpaneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London Very posh yet understated Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurants three small dining rooms

The menu is a very difficult one I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection Great for steak ravioli the best carpaccio in the city best buffala mozzarella mmm I could go on and on So does the menu page after page

Some might call the preparations simplistic This is the Tuscan way Simple ingredients and simple preparation Let the ingredients make their own magic Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smuckers lime jelly but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon

Unfortunately the artful oneofakind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away  UGH  they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all

Daniel himself is a wonderful host He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix Most of it is just American Italian Daniels is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant Enjoy

PS post edit OMG How could I forget the Tiramisu Its a generous portion so you can share with your guest but after your first bite you may not want to Light and airy yet fantastically flavorful the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again Im not going to tell you the secret ingredient Youll have to ask Daniel"
5,"Changing Hands is the perfect bookstore These types of places just dont seem to exist but Changing Hands has managed to survive

Allow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble or probably a Borders but I dont go into that garbage store and cannot be sure With that said there are a few reasons to shop here

First and most importantly they have well priced used books I believe most of their used books are 750 They are also all in pristine condition Now 750 used isnt always that great for a paperback You can do better online quite often Whats notable however is that their hardcovers are typically 750 as well This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat

Second the location of CH is perfect This is one of the best plazas out there Wildflower Trader Joes Macs Jamba Juiceyou cant go wrong

Third and finally Changing Hands is a local store and many good things come with that The staff is extremely friendly From what I can tell they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that The store also has a very welcoming feel to it Once youre in you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is No not just the staffthe customers Everyone is talkative friendly and just seems to be happy They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen Someone will ask the staff who wrote such and such The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  who wrote such and such If he doesnt know someone else will  probably pipe up Its this type of thing that makes it a great store Overall it just has a great atmosphere

The only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is Theres a ton of books on spiritual techniques new age methods buddhism and whatever the hell else hippieshipsters think makes them look more cultured Of course this just goes along with the Tempe Trader Joes and book reading demographic so I cant blame them for meeting the inherent demand"
5,I used to work here so it had to be good Honestly I would say it is the most friendly place I had been to Cashiers are willing to except all coupons and work with their customers The prices are great and the gas rewards system is very useful I just wish it was a Marketplace instead
1,"I have been to a buffet like this before but I will never go to this particular one again 

The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill 

The cook doused our dishes with water quickly cooked the ingredients and returned them in a new bowl 

There is a selection of crispy wonton bits rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite 

Freerange and refills on beverages 

Sat down to eat was not impressed I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting The bowl of ingredients were all bland perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me and changes in selections 

We could have taken the left overs home but opted to leave them instead 

Suffice to say I do NOT recommend"
5,"Walking in was like seeing a rainbow for the first time UHmazing Every type of candy ever created and more candies that youve never even heard of Best part about it was that it was super affordable It was like a minicostco of just candy 

I ended up going twice on Saturday Love it"
1,"Seriously With grocery stores like Fresh  Easy Trader Joes and even Safeway around here I wouldnt go to Whole Foods regularly for ANYTHING unless I was a bajillionaire 1 Its wayyyy overpriced Im not sure if theres a Central Market around here as havent seen one yet but even that is better than this in terms of price 

We got a few items here specialty items in bulk foods for example The wine and beer bar is cool but unlike the Whole Foods in Austin Tx which was the epitome of awesome 2 one cant walk around with beverage in hand here Too bad the rules are so stringent about that because if I were shopping with a glass of wine maybe I wouldnt notice the horrendous prices quite so much

My 3rd complaint is that when we ordered coffees from the coffee stand there my mocha and my boyfriends latte tasted like motor oil after taking forever to be made and the girl saw me swipe my card but THEN told me she didnt have a register person and I wasnt able to cancel the transactionso then we had to go back through the main grocery line again Grrr  I left unsatisfied uncaffeinated and feeling like I had just wasted ten bucks on coffee that we ended up pouring out 

They get one star for having a winebeer bar at all but then I have to take that star away because the bar tender said they sold the most beer and wine of any Whole Foods in existence I call bs  the one in Austin is twelve times busier and people can shop with their beverage of choice and they have a bunch of restaurants there too so its truly an experience  it dazzles This leaves one star for the supply of bulk and specialty items they carry We went to Trader Joes after got twice as much stuff and spent half as much money Sayin"
5,"I love Coach
Stylish and trendy without spending an obscene amount of money on a bag Sure they are still a bit more pricey than a purse at Target but you are paying for name The sales associates are really nice and wont hesitate talking to you I only have a few things from Coach because usually I cant justify spending to much money to accessories but anything you buy here you can use forever A coach bag will probably never go out of style"
5,Amazing place for exceptionally good beer and time with friends Minimal menu but great collaboration with other local vendors and ordering for delivery at their location is encouraged Their beer recently passed Four Peaks as my favorite too not an easy feat If youre on the fence at all about checking this place out do yourself a favor and just get yourself there
5,"Humdinger  
What more is there to say  Its the best sandwich ever  It tastes even better on the weekends when Kids Eat FREE  If you have a larger family  more than 2 kids  this is the best deli in town"
5,"I was initially going to give Rivas 3stars as theyre really just like any other FilibertosUmbertosRobertosErnie and Bertos out there except for a couple of small differences

For one everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there  Its probably not but it tastes like it  And secondly their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there a must for any burrito

The California Burrito with carne asada potatoes pico de gallo and cheese is a must as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries sour cream cheese and guacamole for only 5  Cant be beat especially if youre hammered and its 3 AM 

Not a classy joint not a place you go if youre wary of stupid crap like health code violations the best places never are but definitely a latenight hotspot for the Mill crowd  Lovely

And its not for sissies that dont like ham in their beans either damnit"

5,"I have long been a fan of AJs and lucky for me they didnt open a location on the West Side of town until after I moved back to California If they had I would have been more broke then I was as a single working mother

The daughter and I stopped in before her hair appointment for some coffee and pastries and then I came back in once her hair was getting done The first thing I did was order some iced tea from their coffee counter It was absolutely delicious iced tea and very reasonably priced I want that tea now I think it was pineapple or something yummy 

I perused around the store picking up some Goldwater Salsa and a stuffed Cornish game hen to cook later in the day for my Grandma from the butcher counter I was thrilled that they still had the stuffed fresh hens for the same price I used to pay 499 Something inflation hadnt touchedI also picked up some huge honey crisp apples something again Grandma can afford but wont buy for herself and a small bunch of flowers for her 

Next time I am in town I am going to hit up AJs right away for some iced tea"
1,"I went in once looking for Canidae  Which according to their website bold print they carry but not the fine print  They dont carry it in all of their stores  My dog has food allergies so Im cautious about changing her food quickly but since it was about 7 pm and I was pretty much out of food on this day I figured some food would be better than no food  

During my visit I learned many things  Apparently Canidae is a inferior brand and ripped off its ingredients and packaging from Innova  Innova is a far far superior dog food  Innova is awesome Canidae is for chumps  Innova is also more expensive and a smaller bag  Nothing I couldnt afford but annoying none the less Not wanting to create dog food controversy I bought a bag of the morally superior Innova

But when I checked out I was asked about four times whether I realized I was buying nibbles instead of bits  You know you have the nibbles Are you sure you want nibbles  We have bits if your dog prefers bits

Shes a 70lb lab that will eat anything except for vegetables  I mentioned that the nibbles were fine

Are you sure you want nibbles  We have bits if you want bits

Dude just ring up the freaking food and get me the hell out of here  As expected my dog ate the nibbles  She felt superior for the month supply of Innova that she ate  Then she went back to the ghetto and ate her  inferior Canidae"
5,"I love this place  its a cultural experience  I think even if you are Mexican this place delights all the senses

I love the tortilla department  36 freshly made yellow corn tortillas for 250 

the ladies at the meat dept were fantastic

The wall of spices herbs and chilis was incredible

I did not have enough time to sit and eat there but thats the plan for the next trip

I came home and made shredded beef tacos with all the fixings

My rec is come and linger and enjoy the sights and then have a great lunch either at the food court or at the restaurant next door"
5," I gave this 5 stars based on the best Mexican food Ive had in AZ not based on white linen and waiter service just an fyi
I wont write too much as it seems that everyone already has Both locations are GREAT Some of the best homestyle Mexican Ive ever had I usually get the double wrapped enchilada combo that is pure saucy heaven A great place to call ahead on a friday night when youre exhausted from work and not doing jack pick up your food pick up a six pack of Pacifico and head on home Happiness is a sure bet"
1,I was very disappointed in my encounter with them today  I have been going there for years and thought they have done a good job  Today I picked up my Tori Burch purse that I brought in to have a shoulder strap repaired  The thread they used for the repair was a light cream color  The purse and the stitching is a mustard yellow color  It looks terrible  They tried putting some cream colored shoe polish on the tread no improvement  Now the thread just looked dirty  I told them that I was not at all happy with the repair  They just kept saying in thick accent  Its good I fixed it good  They would not refund the amount I prepaid  prepay only store or redo it with the correct color thread  Just kept saying  I fixed it good  Looks like Ill be finding a new shoe repair place
1,pretentious and bad service  attendants are totally clueless though I feel for them if management makes them wear the costumes they wear overpriced fashion brands  if you want to spend 200 on a flannel there are MUCH better options out there  run in and glance at the sale rack otherwise avoid this place like the plague
1,"I play squash racquets a sport favored by the east coast elites from them Ivy League schools those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class 

Why they let me play Ill never know

Last evening we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness

It was a jolly good show ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a Rodgering

So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip  Janslet me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place and its almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest greasiest grubbiest grossest spot to try to eatthey succeeded

Where to startI knowthe parking lot

When we arrived the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 5060 cars in the parking lot was about 832we raised that by several orders of magnitude just by driving inthis parking lot hasnt seen a lot of traffic from the MercedesBMWLexusJaguar crowd and may never again

After I safely parked a block or 2 away I went inside and took in the look and feel of SJcrappy old wood panelingtables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteriaan intriguing mix of flat panel TVs regular TVs and OTB results screens yeah you can bet the ponies herethe sport of Kings in a slightly less than regal atmosphere

They must have 2025 pool tablesfaded feltand a whole bunch of people playing pool and frankly looking like they werent enjoying themselvesextremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watchingarent games supposed to be fun I suspect there was gambling going on

The smell in SJ can only be described as extreme humanitythe place smelled like it has seen a centurys worth of spilled beer cigarette smoke BO vomit urine spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselvesremarkable given the fact that this place cant have been here for more than a few yearshow did they do that so quickly 

SJ has menus they have some sort of kitchen they have Jagermeister on tap they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet or boofay for my friend Ryan C set up for our group

It was supposed to be a Taco Bar

SJ provided a table full of taco fixinsthe centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot trayHoly Crap was that disgusting 

They told us it was ground beef but I know my beef and I dont think this was itthis was ground creaturepossibly some sort of unfortunate nondistinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called

I kid of courseas far as I know this was indeed beefjust not very good beef

The hot tray holding the meat looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islandssmall mountains of meat rising out of the ocean of brownorange grease that was the real body of the dish

But I was starving a banana for breakfast and nothing else so I tried to make a taco

I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine and use some tongs insteadmy idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possibleI was sort of successful but in doing so I probably squeezed any flavor out as well

I got back to the table and tried a bitenot goodI added several shakes of Cholla and tried another biteand that was that

One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me oneIm not sure what the deal with the wings was but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled no not broiledboiled and then dipped in buffalo saucenot crispy just wetall the way through

Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soonand that was enough for me

Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much

Still its not all bad newsthe tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leaveI didnt become immediately ill although I had kind of a rough morning this morning

They say shared adversity can make teams grow together so I think I should thank SJ for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible"

5,"We just sold the car we bought at Carmax that spawned the original review here almost three years ago

As with the purchase the sale was ridiculously simple The appraisal took about 20 minutes and came in ABOVE Kelley Blue Book excellent condition trade in value  and the car was in good  very good condition but certainly not excellent

A fair price and no hassle At a car dealership Whod have thunk it"
5,"Welcome to Downtown  Finally a little area with a few great chains  They also have PARKING  The parking is located on the east or south side of the building  We grabbed Jersey Mikes on a Sunday afternoon and took it home to eat  They are the best subs we have had  They are packed with meat and cheese  Might be little pricier then blimpie but with it due to the over load of meat
 Check out a Jersey Mikes near you"
5,"Ok these guys get five stars from me for many reasons  Before my visit today my other experience with them was for my wedding cake  They were very courteous and helpful although I ended up going with a cheaper option  Today however they definitely earned five stars

I was there for a meetup event  We got a tour of their facilities  The owner personally did the tour and did a great job considering I brought my toddler who screamed through about 75 of the tour  At the end he gave us a cookie and thanked us for coming  

I know that some people think toddlers should be locked away so as not to annoy the general populous but its nice to know not everyone feels that way "
5,"Pure Bliss  I havent had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time  

The full 4 course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent 

You MUST try the Yin  Yang Martini  It was  a very creative and well presented drink  that had me all smiles  


I had the Smores  Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite Ive tried at least 5 others"
1,"Come on now lets call a turd a turd on this one Waterfront is a stretch its a canal a stinking fucking canal leave it to the Scottsdale developers and planners to put a Scottsdalian slant on the turd kudos to them However with its chain stores and restaurants on one side and pretty lame so far on the other Southbridge this has become quite a giant and over priced turd 

Those skinny Scottsdale bitches that hang out at Pink Taco words of advice Fucking eat something"
5,This is the best Seafood restaurant I have ever eaten in I have to say it is not my kind of place Very Scottsdale But Man they know how to cook I had a Special Shrimp dish of the night that was much better than expected and a very nice portion The Calamari was 1000 times better than any other I have had I am not a big fan usually but this was different It was not fried but pan cooked and even people that didnt like Seafood tried it and loved it The Wedge Salad was good We shared the Mac  Cheese Mashed Potatoes and Peas I felt the sides were the only things that could stand some improvement I had one of the tasty Mojitos and some Yummy Creme Brulee for desert I am super glad this place is far away because I would want to go all the time It is a bit pricy but I felt it was worth it The servers were really cool Not uptight at all The only thing I hated was they have rest room attendants Maybe it is just me but come on I should not have to feel guilty for not tipping someone just for handing me a towel that I could have easily gotten for my self I have little respect for businesses that do that
1,"Hands down the single worst public mass transit system I have seen ANY PLACE I have ever lived or traveled to and I am an avid world traveler 
Ive been riding this system on and off I vaccilate between nonPhoenixmetro cities and here a lot for roughly 10 years and yeah for a few of those years I would also drive a car here and there so I have a sound basis of comparison 

This is a joke compared to other cities in the USA and abroad that have equivalent populations Hell in NYC and LA its SOOO much easier to get around even though those places are larger and more densely populated Phoenix is easily 30 years behind every other citysize comparable mass transit system thats out there Get with the times

We need busses that run MORE than once per 12 hour and thats at its current fastest busses that are ON TIME DAILY they are never on time Always way too early without waiting or way too late without apology more stops stops that have actual BENCHES or SHADE or POSTED INFORMATION of any kind I cannot even imagine how travelers get around on this thing nothing is ever posted with any relevant info or signage

Etc etc etc
But seriously just god awful and a complete joke to anyone who has ever experienced public transport anywhere else"
5,Had a great experience DId not feel gouged or pressured and our dog got the proper treatment for dehydration  Friendly staff Prompt service Special attention from Dr Heinritz appreciated Very professional
5,"awesome iconic eatery whenever i visit az i make it a point to stop off at this ultra friendly fantastic tasting joint 

yeah it takes a while to figure out the ordering process but the staff is super helpful and after the first or second time one can figure out the system its just that everything is abbreviated which requires some thought 

i usually mix 2 entrees to get different flavors love the jerk chicken and fiery pollo diablo

although they are known for their snicker doodles my dessert is usually ordering another entree to take home for later 

hands down one of my favorite eateries i wish we had one in minneapolis mni would probably eat there daily for lunch ha"
5,Love Sams Club Especially those little red velvet cupcakes and Chocolate wine  the best We always do most of our grocery shopping here Always a treat
5,I have been eating at this Waffle house since I was a teenager and it has never failed to provide good food  The employees are courteous and the service is fast  The portions are good for the price and the small dinner feel is great to eat in  I have gone here many times with my disabled brother and have never had any problems with the staff or employees  I also like the fact that they are one of the few 24 hr restaurants available to eat at and this has come in handy many times
1,"Dont do business at this unethical business My 25 savings account from 2009 was  recently stolen from 5 a month for account inactivity fees They are a bunch of crooks

It appears you now need to nickle and dime your customers with BS fees in order to stay in business 

Account closed"
5,Cant wait to go here again Had the shrimp poboy and some homemade banana pudding Ill write more as I try different things on the menu but what I did have was delicious
5,"I love the urban feel of this place and the swanky Apple Store is a big enough draw for me The place is brand new so not too many things are going on yet but more stores are opening all the time Theres now a really highend iPic movie theater a frozen yogurt place a great Nike store and much more to come in addition to HM West Elm and the delicious Oakville Grocery Co 
Parking is fine and its easy to navigate When youre done here you can walk to Kierland across the street too 
Cant wait to see what they do here in a few years"
5,"The hubby and I stayed here on our wedding night We didnt arrive until midnight or so we partied late  and the service was still impeccable After our car was valeted and we were golfcarted down to our casita we were left to enjoy our night of solitude The room itself was beautiful king sized bed fireplace patio overlooking the golf course vanity ipod dock jetted tub separate shower and plush robes and slippers 

We ordered room service probably close to 1 am and it arrived promptly The boy ordered the veggie wrap he said it was delish and I ordered the tossed greens salad with balsamic For 13 the salad was a total miss Just a few mediocre lettuce leaves tomatoes onions and cucumbers thrown on a plate I was hungry though so it worked

The next morning we slept in as late as we could I woke up with the worst heartburn thanks balsamic so I called the front desk for some Tums No problem they arrived pronto We packed up and called for a ride and although they said they were busy they arrived shortly after 

I would love to come back here and stay a little longer The service was great the place was beautiful and for the one night we were there it was damn perfect"
1,If youre looking for a dining experience at Frys deli area youre better off going to an actual sit down restaurant  Frys dining style food in the deli area is very substandard at the best
5,The first couple of times I ate here I wasnt sure why people were always so crazy for this place Its been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months Ive already been here like three times and wanted to go back more Ive decided that its all about what you order for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings have fun Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try Also dont be afraid to speak up I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didnt pay attention Now I ask for lots of lettuce and theyre happy to make it the way I like They make their breads fresh and they have garlicherb bread that has lots of flavor I wont order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing I am a picky ranch eaterI hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesnt taste or resemble mayo I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor They have the best home made ranch dressing here Pair it with the garlicherb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor OMG Wipesorry I just started to drool a bit Service is goodeveryone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwichI get the Pinner 8 but I swear some days I am so hungry I think Im going to order the Blunt 12maybe someday soon All sandwiches get toasted Okay so toppings Guacamole sprouts lettucespring mix onions mushrooms tomatoes black olives I get mine wo cucumbers pickles your choice of cheese I get Swiss with their house goodies EVOO vinegar herb mixture on top Now that I found my sandwich I crave it all the time and cant wait for my next visit Oh be sure to check their daily specials too If youre lucky enough to be in their delivery areawell darn you then 
1,"Staff is nice and thats it
They use very cheap tires that only last for a year"
5,"The customer service at this Macys was seriously out of this world Both my mom and I who were visiting from out of town me San Diego and her Baltimore have never ever experienced such friendly and helpful customer service at any department store anywhere EVER We were there late at night probably for the 2 hours right before closing on a one day sale day In every single dept We went ladies dresses ladies shoes mens etc EVERYONE was soooo nice and helpful Most of our visit was in ladies dresses Those reps did everything possible to help us find dresses in different sizes which can definitely be challenging at the end of a season and at the end of a one day sale when things are haphazardly placed everywhere and to call other Macys stores when we were unsuccessful in finding a dress at that location in a particular size Sure they wanted a sale but to be so helpful so late at night right before closing after a long one day sale was shocking We must have encountered at least 10 different sales associates while wondering through the store and each and every one was soooo nice and helpful The selection at least in womens was better than most other Macys Ive been to to boot 

I wish this was my local Macys Go here hopefully your experience is just as good as mine "
5,"I dont know why I waited so long to visit Yogurtology its located conveniently next to my Safeway  Why did i wait so long

Yogurtology has perfected selfserve froyo  The flavors are spotonlemon meringue birthday cake NSA coffee peach mango tart cheesecake mango rootbeerthe list goes onI always end up getting oatmeal cookie  Its made inhouse with real oatmeal cookies  Were talking oatmeal cookie literally IN the froyo none of that artificial flavor crap  It is incredible  

Instead of having little placards for the flavors there are digital Sony TV screens that describe each flavor and a brief nutritional rundown  Very hightech

The selection of toppings is unparalleledbaklava three different kinds of twix and milky way brownie chocolate chip cookie bar chocolate covered waffle cone premium fruit and nutsanything you can imagine Yogurtology has it  

Not only that but the shop is impeccably clean and the staff are consistently cheerful  This place blows Yogurtland and Yogurtopia AND all other Yogurtology locations out of the water

This is where you want to go"
5,"I grew up at this library  And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library  They have a great selection of audio books  I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be 

Clean safe you are not bothered by stranger dangers  I dig this library"
1,Terrible rolls The Dragon was so so The California was bland and the Spicy Tuna was cat food Seriously it  looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible
5,"Having just moved to Scottsdale I had seen Four Peaks brews at local restaurants and couldnt wait to try it My bf and I visited the brewery after a long day at the Phoenix Zoo The location was easy to find with plenty of street parking although it could be difficult during peak hours We found a nice table on the halfindoor seating area The ambiance was very cool with a converted loft warehouse sort of feel

The bf had the beer sampler which I helped myself to some sips of I ordered a pint of the Kilt Lifter which was a great deal during happy hour Next I tried the Pumpkin Porter full price even during happy hour Foodwise I had the pub fish and chips which are battered in Kilt Lifter and the bf had the french dip Both items were on par with good quality pub fare

Kilt Lifter great medium brew very smooth The type of beer you could drink every day and never tire of Pumpkin Porter we loved it so much we purchased a growler so we could take some home Note there is an extra charge for filling up a growler with a seasonal brew 4 for the growler itself 10 for beer and 5 seasonal charge Normal refills of growlers are 10

I am a beer lover I have spent time living in Munich and drinking some of the best beers in the world You cant go wrong with Four Peaks brews Next stop North Scottsdale location Closer to home and hopefully just as great"
5,Love this place Just went here and ordered the petite filet and lobster tail everything is so good here I also love the pork chop My favorite dessert is the lava cake hot and yummy
1,The cheesy breadsticks were delicious  Everything else not so much
5,My favorite restaurant in AZ No Contest Awesome staff delicious food and the best salsa
5,This isnt your typical Mexican restaurant that puts cheese and sour cream on everything The food here is light simple and fresh We started out with the guacamole which was amazing My sister doesnt even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style The salsa that came with it was the bomb One was a spicy red salsa and the other one was a tomatillo salsa The green one was so good I wanted to drink it I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my sister ordered a couple of tacos with rice and beans Everything tasted great and I even had room for dessert after my meal We had some kind of carmel banana crepe thing It doesnt look like much but it was one of the best desserts Ive ever had Gallo Blanco is my new obsession
1,When ownersstaff changed we kept hoping for the best  The friendly ownerscooks of the previous restaurant were top notch hence the good reviews  But now alas   Lemon chicken that turned out to be pork and bad at that wontons in soup that fall apart greasy greasy lo mein and eggrolls its just not worth it  Prefer to give locals the business but this is truly awful even after many hopeful tries  Panda Express it is until someone else does a better job
5,We have been taking our dogs to AllStar since they opened The staff has always been great and remembers our girls by name and the Vets are fantastic Any Dr who will get down on the ground and love on my doggies is ok in my book They have squeezed us in for emergency visits many times We have also boarded our dogs here and they take awesome care of them Just wish they were opened on the weekends
5,"My first box of NGD arrived a few weeks and tears nearly came to my eyes as I removed the produce from the box  I havent seen such beautiful fresh well packaged produce since I was a kid and Im no spring chicken  The carrots tasted like the sweet carrots I remember and the lettuce with the dirt from the farm still fresh on the leaves so full of flavor  The amazing thing is that I had come to expect most organic vegetables and fruits to be less visually appealing than the chemical type but such is not the case with NGD

The medium size box has been perfect for our little family of four  It is delivered on our day like clockwork around 2am  The unseen elf that drops off the goodies is nice enough to open the carton and place all the contents in our cooler so everything stays nice in this boiling cauldron we call Phoenix  Furthermore I live way out in CarefreeCave Creek where we always expect to be on the list of places too far away for delivery  Not with NGD  It appears from the labeling they have optimized their routes so they can include many outlying areas 

Finally there is a gentleman named Ben that works for NGD  He has been very helpful in making sure everything is going smoothly and that we are using the service properly

We think NGD is a great value for organic produce delivered to your door and HIGHLY recommend NGD"
5,"Went here for the first time today  Loved it  Becca was funprofessional and did a great job

I have been looking for a place to get a big boy haircut since I moved in the area a few months ago so far Canyon Falls has impressed me Normally I just settle for whats cheap and quick from an 11 haircut place Yes I paid more for my cut at Canyon Falls but it was worth it  

The place is clean the employees are clean I was greeted right away when I came in and I left FEELING like I got a good cut  I was only in for a cutshampoo so I cant comment on any of the other services they offer but  I think I might have found a my new place to get my hair cutat last  Thanks Becca"
5,Great fun atomosphere Service was great My wife and I had a wonderful date night here  The fillet was nicely cooked and the sides were just as good  Average prices but great value Highly recommend this place for date night
5,Family friendly and we love the soups and salads  Mushroom soup is our favorite  We also enjoy their veggie sandwich but all of them that we have tried are delicious  Sunday brunch is great too  We do frittatas or banana pancakes yum  Or a simple Wildflower capaccino and scone does the trick  Webe been going for years and will continue to go  Oh did I mention the free WiFi  Great for some business lunches
5,"Ive played well over 40 of the Golf Magazine Top 100 courses in the US Were lucky to have many of them here right in our backyard This course stands out Exemplary service and the driving range is the best Ive ever seen

The course is tough No country club rolls here Hit it right or left and youre undoubtedly taking a drop and a stroke

Cant wait to get back for my next round"
1,"My love affair with Pita Jungle is a long oneperhaps longer than any other restaurant certainly longer than I can remember and at least for the adult portion of my life which is why it pains me to write this review 

For the last 6 months I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location typically on a Friday or Saturday The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment Although the food is always spot on at Pita my takeout experience has been anything but 

The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food I ended up waiting past the promised time Now Im not unreasonable waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30 minutes past the pick up time with no apologies or explanations I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there The last time I mustve looked really irritated because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait 

Used to the wait I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time just as preventative maintenance Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face I get back to my friends house open the bag and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up We ordered 4 items 3 of which were wrong I load one item up and head back to Pita Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing but blatantly screwing up my order is too much As I explain my situation to the takeout girl she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong As I struggle to keep my cool I inform them that they must be mistaken One item was ordered with chicken my item was turkey and the other two were salads Everything came with chicken The salads were for my vegetarian friends and Im allergic to chicken Theres no way youre going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians Sorry try again Without too much ado the correct dishes were provided and yet another obligatory baklava was offered I declined There is only so much wrong that baklava can right Dont get me wrong their baklava is amazing but its not going to make up for them screwing up my order then trying to blame it on me Oh and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer Too bad the coupon expires in a few days 

Im afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere until enough time has passed that maybe just maybe I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle In the meantime I suggest you try to get it together down there In case you missed the count thats 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on including 1 you tried to blame on me Thats shameful"
5,"I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary After preyelp we knew what to expect as to prices so it wasnt so much of a shocker

To the food we concur with almost everyone here It was impeccable We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented Ours came with 3 appetizers raw oysters crab claws and dungeness crab so it wasnt too high They are all fresh Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs so I know what those taste like And for 6 years living in the desert Mastros is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that  

For main course I got Ivory Salmon Oreganata bf got Swordfish blackened I am quite picky when it comes to fish and bf isnt exactly a fish person but both of our dishes surpassed expectation I couldnt say much about swordfish except it was fresh We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastros It was my first having Ivory Salmon it was sweeter and white hence the name than normal salmon we get around here Mine was good size portion firm to the touch but melted in the mouth The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself or you can add one of the sauces provided One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives came with the main course

Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas I didnt really care for snap peas as I can make them at home But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there Im not sure how they prepared it but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque instead of water and milk and added lobster chunks It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes It was big enough to share and take home One thing though it hardened up after sitting out for awhile so Im not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge

Drinks there are amazing from the presentation to the taste and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers reviews Total worth it

The service was amazing We had Robert We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable Next time we go back I would definitely ask for him again

We didnt order dessert since they gave us a darkchocolate Happy Anniversary cake with the letters written also in chocolate The overall experience was 4 34 just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other The acoustic of the room wasnt very good and it got loud Didnt see much of cougarmanther scene as we were in the dining room And maybe it was during weekdays we saw lots of expense account people though"
5,"I have had chicken I have had waffles And now Ive had chicken AND waffles 

Prior to today I didnt realize the distinction Prior to today I never had cause to consider the combination Prior to today I didnt realize what I was missing

Now lets be clear this isnt the place for dieters Its not a place for any pretentious behavior The place has Chicken  Waffles in the name OK And thats what youre going to get In abundance

Cheap as hell I had the 1 also known as KKs Three hugeass pieces of chicken  breas thigh and mutant leg All battered and fried to perfection Two waffles the size of Vermont A bucket of grits with some eggcheeseonion concoction on the side OK I could have done without the last part But hey when in a chicken  waffle place

Im still full I wont eat dinner tonight I crashed out for an hour in postprandial bliss And Id have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a fouryearold

Damn"
1,Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine Several times  either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria  the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 3080 years of age Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with its just how we do things and theres no point in asking because they wont turn it down even a little The waiter David said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner really doesnt care Hubris is so unappetizing I think the food is great but because I have no desire to support a business that really doesnt give a crap about its clientele Ill spend my money lavishly elsewhere
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this office  During my highrisk pregnancy I spent a lot of time at this office and in the hospital  Both Dr Hahn and Dr Spieker were fantastic very knowledgable and easy to talk to  I trust them completly as they did everything to ensure both myself and my baby were well taken care of   I have since seen Dr Cyr for a quick appointment whom is very sweet
5,"First Id like to send a shoutout to Irma our server who has given me hope that there are caring hospitable people in the food industry  Irma receives 5 stars for taking good care of me and my sweetheart during our recent date at the Havana Cafe Way to go Irma

We step into a well packed restaurant on a Friday night with plans to try the Sailors Paella Special and a few cocktails We wait for just a few seconds until we are greeted by Irma and her warm smile and are led to our table Our cocktail orders are taken immediately 1 Mojito and 1 White Sangria Both exceeded our expectations and were just thing to get our date started

The ambiance is whimsical and charming  Reminded me of the movie The Bird Cage without the drag queens and dramatic dialogue Bummer

Now on to the Paella It was the perfect dish for the evening offering plenty of shrimp calamari crab scallops muscles tuna and a healthy serving of saffron rice This meal also requires a little handy work to get to the crab and muscles but you are given the proper instruments to do so This may not be the best choice for those who do not enjoy this kind of food activity but we had a lot of fun with it  We will be back soon to try another interactive meal and partake of a round or two of Mojitos 

So if you are in the mood for something different fun and oh so delicioso I recommend you try a night out at the Havana Cafe I also hope you have the pleasure of meeting a groovy gal who goes by the name Irma"
5,"REAL NY STYLE CHINESE FOOD HERE IN ARIZONA 
FREE HOT TEA AND FRIED WONTON SKINS LIKE BACK HOME BY REQUEST

I am from New Jersey and so are the owners  They opened up shop here 1 year after I moved here 1998 and I was delighted i could get a real NY eggroll and spare ribs in Arizona  Their best dish i feel is the Szechuan Garlic Chicken or shrimp  Try it once and you may never try anything else on the menu its that good  Tastes the same as the best of NYC

Their lunch specials are amazing  Comes with soup spring roll crab puff fried rice hot tea by request all for a very low price  Sunday is Dim Sum if you like dumplings  This place NEVER disappoints and I bring work clients here from New York all the time

they all agree REAL NY CHINESE FOOD"
5,"This is a great place to shop grab a bite eat dessert relax or just hang around

Eat at one of the many excellent restaurants like Christophers Seasons 52 Black Chili Mexican and Capitol Grill Swing by Royal for a cappuccino iced latte or your favorite coffee of the day Savor frozen delight from Haagen Dazs or Mojo Yogurt  ahhh my sweet Mojo you and I have been in an on and off relationship for the past year now by off I mean the 3 or 4 days a week Im NOT there   

Movies in the park nights are fun to go to gasping laughing and crying with 200 of your closest people you probably just met Get there early for good seats about 30 min or more otherwise youll be stuck behind a tree or some tall guy you cant see around Be sure to bring a lawn chair along or a blanket to throw down if youll be attending one of these events

The shopping is top notch  but be sure to bring your wallet Most shops here will cost you at least your first born child or an equivalent value

Happy shopping to all my yelping buddies"
5,Best ribs in Arizona besides my own
5,Weve been going here for years Love the food Happy Family is a favorite dish and appreciate the community service outreach Great to support locals who support the community  and dish up great food along the way
5,Loved it Pulled pork  pulled chicken bbq sauce  the cole slaw were ALL outstanding ONLY caveat is that GPS tries to send you to thhe wrong side of the highway It is in the shopping center with CVS  Circle K
5,"Great new addition to the Old Town neighborhood Citizen is versatile  the perfect place for a romantic date a small gathering or for just meeting a buddy for a drink A place with a great vibe

My first impression was that they are intently focused on service quality Lots of smiling staff to greet you as you enter Every employee is attentive to every table Our server was gregarious accommodating gracious and highly proactive We definitely felt the warm and fuzzy atmosphere

They pay attention to the little things  such as housemade ketchup for your french fries 

The food about as good as upscale bar food is going to get For apps we started with the calamari and the crabcakes Portions werent large but very high quality The calamari was flashfried and not greasy and seemed very fresh For my entree I had the wagyu burger which was prepared perfectly and served on a fresh challah bun

Overall impression Citizen will have staying power unlike many establishments that open in Old Town The formula is really pretty simple  offer high quality stuff equip the place with great staff and dont go overboard with prices Im looking forward to returning"
5,While Calabria Italian Kitchen  Deli is at this location the Grocery portion has been CLOSED
5,Went here while on vacation in Phoneix based on seeing it on Man vs Food Could not have been more impressed Food was amazing Far above expectations  The torta was huge and delicious Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic authentic meal at a good price
5,"My mother and I were actually getting out of the car to go to Streets of New York next door when she smelled the Mexican food and suggested we try Robertos instead  That should tell you what you need to know right there

Its a hole in the wall place for sure and leaves much to be desired visually but the staff was exceptionally pleasant and the tables were clean  If youre looking for fine dining this isnt your place  At 710 for an entree though it was delicious

Beans rice and chips were pretty standard but the salsa fish taco and shredded beef tostada were very flavorful  The food tastes homemade and in this case thats a good thing

This place was also featured on TLCs Diners and Driveins show back in the day  One of Anthems best kept secrets  Ill be back"
5,I have been eating here since high school so i can safley say bout 35 years The food is still as good as it was when 15 of us would jump into Smittys vw van and drive down for our 30 minuet lunch break West high of course It has been owned by the same family since it opened in the early 1800s Yes the cheese crisp are awesome but the tacos not the shredded beef but the regular tacos are the best in town Order a couple they are sooo good Love you Los
5,I LOVE DIllys I always get the Dilly Club and Chicken Noodle Soup which comes with a bread bowl that is oh so yummy
5,Creative Healing Solutions is a fantastic naturopathic doctors office      Im so grateful that I found this place and met Dr Roxie Strand and her wonderful assistant Melissa  My life has changed so much for the better since April 2012 when I walked into her office super frustrated with many previously unsuccessful weight loss attempts   Dr Roxie was attentive and thorough and suggested I consider HCG   I had never heard of it before then so I went home and did my research  I was a little nervous but never felt any pressure and when I decided to give it a try I felt very at ease being under her supervision  Now Im 85 lbs lighter and feel better than I have in years   I could go on and on and speak to how wonderful the program office and Dr Strand are but I simply suggest that you consider visiting Dr Roxie yourself if you are seeking to address medical issues that you havent been able to solve before  She does a free consultation and is genuinely interested in helping find a holistic health solution for you   I never thought I could totally change my lifestyle but Dr Roxie definitely helped me find a way to do it and has been a major supporter in my journey which I appreciate so much    Whether you are in need of a weight loss solution or need someone to help with other medical matters I fully recommend Dr Strand
5,"After spending a combined seven years as a graduate student at ASU imagine my dissapointment when I came to discover that there was finally decent Asian food walking distance from campus two months after my departure for internship in San Diego 

Dragonfly combines what I like about Vietnamese food variety flavor price with what I like about a modern trendy restaurant good decor modern music attentive servers 

Though everything on the menu is above average one item really stands out cha gio cream cheese I believe at this location its called tiger rolls Completely inauthentic and I couldnt care less DAMN theyre good When I drive in from San Diego I often head there on my first night in town occasionally as soon as I hit the Phoenix area before stopping off to drop off my bags Honestly one of the best things Ive tasted anywhere Highly highly recommend"
5,I had lunch here today with co workers and it was absolutely delicious Cannot wait to go back gain
5,"OOOOOWWWEEEE Have yall tried ATL Wings yet If not what are you waiting for  They are the BOMB Diggity

I dont know why I havent updated my review either so here I go 


The honey habanero are still my 1 but I also love the Cajun Hot  Holy Crap Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out The only time you really feel the burn is when youre no longer eating gums  tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more yes my friends thats the heat I love


Luv me some wings from ATL"
5,Wow this place is great The whole atmosphere is unique Bowling bars dj  its an awesome idea Only thing is on a Friday its super busy and takes along time to get a bowling lane
5,"Perfect hotel for my conference travel needs  Clean new great bars close to other food options across the street super friendly staff  Great business traveler property  The bed was SOOO comfortable  Sometimes Starwood beds can be too soft but this was just right  

Access to the convention center is so convenient  Just out the door and down a block and a half  Cant beat that in the heat"
5,Duane is amazing  Reliable Responsive Reasonably Priced i simply cant reccomend him enough  Ive used him four separate times now and have been more than happy with each visit  I wont call anyone else
5,This place seems to get better every time I visit The first time was a Friday night out with the guys We met up for dinner and I had and loved the pulled pork and sweet potato fries After dinne we got our drink on with a live band The waitress was helpful in getting us drunk off a variety of liquors And the shots kept on coming It was a blast The second time was more laid back just grabbing a beer with a girlfriend It was a Tuesday and the place was pretty busy The next time me and the girlfriend showed up completely wasted and they had an Irish band playing It was a perfect way to end our night after clubbing at the gay bar We had a baileys nightcap and everything went dark from there Awesome night
5,Amazing place I had the swordfish with pasta and fresh veggies Delicious great service Although the check was a little late the waiter brough amaretto on the rocks to apologize
5,Last time I went it was lunchtime on a weekday  Our server was very quick and attentive  The sushi lunch deal was amazing  Piping hot miso delicate seaweed salad crisp cucumber salad flavorful sauteed veggies fresh orange slices and the main attraction  tuna yellowtail and salmon all absolutely fresh and perfectly prepared  I left totally stuffed and happy  One caveat  they should turn down the music a little during lunch happy hour should be one level of noise and lunch should be several octaves below that
5,My house is clean using petfriendly products  They arrive on time  I know that some of the reviews talk about having trouble reaching them by phone but I have never had a problem reaching them by email which I prefer  The ladies show up work quickly and efficiently and are on their way  I couldnt be happier
5,"Thanks fellow yelpers for brining us to Four Peaks  My husband and I were stuck in Phoenix for the night and needed a place for dinner  Ironically we ended up at Four Peaks a Vikings bar on our way back home to Minnesota  

My husband loves beer brews a ton of his own and especially enjoyed the beer sampler Trying 10 beers for around 9 yes please  I dont really love beer so I had a cider and it was exactly what I needed  For dinner I had the turkey burger with fries  The turkey burger was standard but the fries were awesome  I think it was the beer batter  My husband go the carne adovada and he raved  I think he may try to convince me to fly back to Phoenix just for that dish

The atmosphere was also great  It was very laid back and fun to be able to sit amongst the beer being made  

I highly recommend Four Peaks whether you are a Phoenix native or otherwise"
5,Ever since I was diagnosed with a Gluten intolerance Chipotles yummy burrito bowl has been my constant companion The barbacoa is seasoned well and works even better with a kick of the Chipote Tabassco sauce
5,I have been going to Arizona Auto Care since about 2002 when I worked in the same complex I have since worked all around the valley and moved out of state and back and I have always only taken my vehicles there for service They are honest and professional and always take excellent care of my vehicles Jeff is one of the owners and a Subaru master tech and has worked on countless Subarus for me friends and family Jeff and team will give you honest and sound advice when fixing your car and not try to oversell you just to make up sales and quotas like the stealerships Thanks again Jeff Chris  guys at AZ Auto Care for years of great service and to many more
5,"MARGARITA timeI love their ritas on the rocks 

Their shrimp tacos are my favorite in town I love the salsa bar The wait staff has always been nice The prices of  food and drink are great This is a great place to go with friends to eat good mexican food  kick back a few drinks
 The patio area is nice all year round"
5,"Went back they appeared to have remodeled and noise level was greatly reduced  Food atmosphere everything still wonderful  In my first review I stated the only reason Im giving it less than 5stars is because of the noise level  As the noise level issue appears to have been rectified my review is subsequently being modified to reflect this

Last time I was there I had a salmon salad which was good though in all honesty the salmon was the star of the dish  I asked the server to please ask the chef how the salmon was cooked so such perfection  I honestly did not expect for any type of response  Lo and behold a gentleman came out and explained the procedure utilized to get that sear and texture without overcooking or undercooking the salmon

Re Another reviewers issue with soggy fried calamari
It is tempura calamari which is different from other ways to fry the calamari  I have never had any issues with sogginess unless I leave it to sit for too long  Hmm  Clearly they prefer Zinc Bistro  Honestly I havent been to Zinc Bistro so I cannot draw a comparison at this time between the two

I will definitely go back as soon as I can to The Greene House  Oh loved the recent press on the Chefs high praise it is well deserved"
5,I cant believe no one has talked about Pasta Tuesday Definitely the best time to go but make sure you get there early because the pasta literally runs out It is that good They have this guy Guido come every Tuesday and he starts making hand made pasta early in the morning He picks 2 unique dishes It was one of the best pasta I have EVER tasted I crave it all the time I had a fettucini noodle in a alfredo creme sauce with herbs and pine nuts on top I cant even describe the taste wow what a good food critic i am You just have to go check it out I am going TONIGHT
5,"Ive brought my dogs here and met with both Dr Holmes and Dr Edwards and they were both extremely knowledgeable and helpful Over the last 15 years of living in Phoenix we brought all 6 dogs that we have had in that time to come see them and I wouldnt go anywhere else This past summer I moved to Boston and regrettably havent found a quality veterinary hospital like Pecan Grove Ashamedly even after talking to my current vet and be unsatisfied with their answers we called Pecan Grove and Dr Holmes was very helpful and was even able to reference cases and articles to us over the phone While the answer we got from our Boston vet sounded more like they were guessing than actually knowing the answer

Pecan Grove and everyone there is amazing and I wouldnt go anywhere else had I not moved across the country"
5,One of the few legit brewpubs around
1,Wow After eating sushi from across the nation i have to say Scottsdales Geisha A Go Go has surprised me for an ultimate low Andrew the manager reassured us that we had something wrong with our taste buds for not tasting how fresh the fish was here Insulting to assume Not recommended
5,"Agree with the previous review Something nice about this super target  Leaving a review to back up the other

My only gripe is I spend to much at Targer Or my wife does anyway"
5,"burger heaven I had THE PIG Burger it was delicious  and it was served on a pretzel roll  mmmmmm

Good vibe feeling in Circle H I like the pictures on the walls the bar look the entire environment was relaxed and easy going  I came the day of the official ribbon cutting so I got to see that happen i had no idea those giant gold scissors were real scissors by the way  i guess that is a dumb though bc what else would they be and it was nice to see everyone gathered for this moment

The french fires were piping hot and delicious they have all sorts of sides like slaw beans mac n cheese etc  

I also had a bite of the brisket sandwich  It was so very very good I am ordering that next time I go back  

Local beers on tap good price too

Great start for a new restaurant there were of course the new hickups but those kins get worked out with more time Nothing to worry about  Thats how you learn"
5,"We only come here for the water and in that regard there are no complaints about this place

There is no chlorine smell faucets are all fast and the guys find your water card fast"
5,"My picks
Derby Smash
Green Chili Risotto
Pan Seared Escolar
Sticky Buns

If you are looking for Arizona charm this is the place Every Arizona resident needs to experience this hidden gem

Thanks Jacquie Kristy  Tim for continuing to believe in this historic restaurant and landmark"
5,We went today after lunch I got my usual of lime basil and real mint chip which I love for the real mint leaves and my hubby got chocolate guiness and four peaks hop knot Best ice cream in Phoenix The staff is always super nice They give us ice bags to take our ice cream home   Love this place
5,Awesome
5,Last week I had my first appointment at Pure Dental Dr Kang and the office staff were all really nice and helpful Dr Kang even did my cleaning and it was very thorough Ive never had the actual dentist give me my cleaning I was wowed by their modern equipment to view xrays and the doctor even took pictures of my teeth to show me I will be going back to get some filings next week and was told I could watch a movie while I was getting them done
5,"This is my first review on Yelp so here you go

I love Yasu  This is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in Phoenix  I have been there numerous times and it never disappoints  

You have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal last time I was there I had the beef tonguesounds weird but its so good

Nigirisashimi are a must  They always have the best selection and daily special most importantits always freshthis is definately important  The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order you will find the fish is sliced with great execution  

Request fresh chopped wasabi you will never eat sushi with out it again  

Love this place"
5,"Went here earlier this spring and WOW  What a way to watch spring training 
I LOVE the Giants stadium and this is much better It has twice as much lawn seating the seats are wide and comfortable AND  aimed towards home plate which didnt used to seem like a big deal but sitting in Scottsdale down the line IT IS 
The food there is top notch with an amazing pizza slice 
Plus the ability to walk around to diff fields and watch other players work out is amazing  it sucks that the Giants keep fields separate I think every team should do such a joint complex"
5,They have the friendliest staff at this Whole Foods They know me by name and always have samples ready for the little boy I nanny before we even walk up to the Deli counter Maureen the checker Kathy in vitamins and Daniel  Paula in the Deli are all exceptional go see them if you need anything they will be happy to help
5,I absolutely love the food here the service is good the food is excellent and as far as the price goesI cant complain this is one of favorite places to eat
5,My husband and I drove from LA to Scottsdale and almost to Scottsdale one of our tires was going flat  We went to Discount Tire on Shea and they checked it and found it was a cracked wheel the tires are new  They helped us get a new tire shipped from the east coast and put it on first thing the next morning  They were nice helpful honest and affordable  Absolutely great service  I highly recommend them
5,"This is by far the best and most authentic Mexican food Ive had in this area of town I try and get different dishes each time I visit and have yet to be disappointed 

If youre looking for an amazing locationviewatmosphere this probably isnt the place for you If youre looking for amazing food then youve come to the right place 

The prices are great for what you get The quesadillas are served on a pizza tray so bring your appetite"
5,"Fantastic venue Province really adds a touch of class and elegance in a way that isnt pushy or over the top Located in the Westin Hotel the restaurant feels very modern You can choose to sit inside in a beautifully decorated and spacious dining area or enjoy their fabulous patio with fireplaces and a great water feature 

The food was unbelievable I sampled their tuna and watermelon appetizer and fell in love  what an amazing combination that Id never have thought of

If the food isnt enough the service is superb Every interaction with the staff was excellent  you can tell they enjoy their restaurant and are happy to be there 

I cannot wait to come back to Province as soon as possible"
5,"I took a road trip with the fellas to watch the LA Kings beat the Phoenix Coyotes  the Jobingcom Arena and I must say our experience at this hotel far exceeded expectations

Not only was the hotel suite very affordable when split between 4 guys 3 queen beds and 1 roll away all in 1 suite at no extra charge but the room was very nice included a small refrigerator and microwave and was very comfortable  Very new and modern and all we had to do was walk across the street to the whole Westgate Centerbarsrestaurantsarena which was a HUGE plus  At the end of a drunken debauchery filled night we stumbled back a 5 minute walk to our hotel safely 

We were going to stay a few miles away to save money but read some reviews about the hotels having bed bugs and being dirty  You wont have that problem staying here  The room was immaculate and the staff were beyond friendly and accommodating  That was probably the best part  Friendly staff  The staff literally gave off a small town feel the only time Ive ever been treated better was at a bed and breakfast  And  the morning breakfast was another thing that made this hotel worth it  After drinking all night and being hung over all we needed to do was stumble down to the lobby to get some eggs sausage ham toast bagels waffles apple and orange juice and we were refueled up for some more debauchery  They had something for everyone including a variety of cereals and  whatever you can think of for breakfast free of charge  

So if youre planning on staying anywhere near the Westgate centerPhoenix stadiumJobingcom arena this is the place to stay  We will definitely be staying here again the next time Im out in AZ for a game"
5,"Finally a great place to get breakfast that isnt Dennys or iHop in Gilbert Came here with my family and we just made it before the change in menus 

The griddle bread pudding was AMAZING Probably the highlight of the meal We also ordered the veggie sandwich AllAmerican breakfast  a slice of red velvet cake  

We have definitely found our goto Breakfast joint when my sister and I both come back to Gilbert to visit the Rents"
5,This place has negra modelo on tap  I would almost give them 4 stars alone for that  The food here is incredible very reasonably priced and is mostly locally grown and raised  Add in there musical taste a mixture of latin and indie rock and you have a place about to explode from too much hipster cred  I mean that in a good way  We live in the east valley so this is a haul for us but this is THE place we take our out of town guests  Everyone loves it
5,"I took advantage of Thats A Wrap for their catering services yesterday and once again was totally impressed  I called around 10am for a 5pm delivery I wanted to make sure that those of us who were working at the Phoenix Art Museum all day preparing for the pARTy had some fuel to get us through the evening  Sure enough Thats A Wrap delivered  literally and figuratively  

I ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches fruit chips cookies and bottled water  it was perfect  Everything was delicious  It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating  I had the Godfather wrap Salami ham and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce tomato red onion sun 
dried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil  I dont usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday  and it was

Thanks Thats A Wrap for fueling me and all of the yelper helpers for the pARTy Ill be back to visit soon"
5,I personally like this Frys I think most of the people that work there are extremely friendly I go there once or twice a week and Im always greeted with a smile A few of them even ask me where Ive been if I havent been in for awhile and ask me how Im doing Complaing about a grocery store being crowded doesnt make sense to me since that means people like shopping there They have no control of it being crowded If you dont like it crowded go across the street to Safeway where there is no one shopping there Then you will see a difference of why Frys is better Why is it so busy Because it has better deals and everyone wants to shop there Its a positive thing You can either deal with it being crowded once in awhile and save money or go to Safeway across the street where you will be the only shopper and get ripped off You have options
5,love love love this place for a second i dont feel like im in fakville anymore  Live music and a diverse crowd  They make a great infused berry tea smoothie no dairy just juice and ice  Parking is great and the selection of food is appropriate and divine for a cafe  Very comfortable and not to image conscious inside  Love that its independent and staff is so lovely  I would pay 10 for a latte just to support them  Punch card too
5,I absolutely love this place  Ive had my birthday here twice in the last 5 years and they have been able to accommodate large groups up to 20s  Their patio is super cute and great in the fall and spring time  My favorite pizza is the Di Notte  Cute atmosphere combined with good food  one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix  Worth the drive to downtown
5,A hipster shindig for day and night make your meal with THE Burger au Poivre Cobb Salad and best made cocktails around One of the best places for brunch
5,I had been wanting to come back for a while  I love this restaurant  Last night we had a magnificent meal  I started with the St Francis Lemonade a perfect cocktail to start your meal  There are so many wonderful choices  They are featuring a special menu for New Years however you can order from it a la carte so we decided to start with the Arizona Citrus Salad  It was delicious  I love the combination of dates goat cheese and orange slices  I also chose from the special menu the sea scallops  WOW they were so sweet and tender  They were served over a bed of black lentils so amazing  The portion was generous 5 scallops I am glad I didnt order the side of sweet corn polenta  I ended up ordering dessert yes my hubby twisted my arm NOT  I had the usual Sticky Toffee Pudding and my hubby had the Chocolate Stout Cake  I had a bite of his and it was great  I cannot guarantee I wont stick to my usual dessert but it was a closed one  I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live  It is such a great place
5,"Today our travels took us to the Chandler Mall on 10312012 Therefore we were near to Abuelos for lunch Nothing like returning to a Restaurant that you found to be very good We arrived after 1PM so we were seated ASAP

We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole Nice way to start off lunch My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special Both item arrived on a very hot platewonderful Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear

Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refillsalways a sign of great service

Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day We highly recommend Abuelos for a great lunch or dinner"
5,"Have you ever eaten somewhere and just cant get the craving out of your head and you have to go back  This is the place that does it to me  Ive decided I need to try everything on their menu

You have to try the Roasted Turkey and Stuffing it is to DIE for  And the mac n cheese  so yummy    Ive also had the Prosciutto and Fig Jam sandwich and I thought I had died and gone to heaven  I had that with fruit which was good  

Guess where Im going for lunch yeah there because I need it after doing this review    

Oh and before I forget When the weather is nice sit out side  You will love it"
5,The best tacos in the city amazing veggies and indescribably great salsas The tacos are like tapas so you need to order two or three but they are reasonably priced Nice atmosphere and friendly staff with great art to view while waiting for your order
5,"I love this place Great place to grab a quick smoothie or stay to hang out just let them know if youre in a  hurry

PS The phone number is area code 480 not 490 "
5,The first time I went to YCs was in scottsdale I loved how you choose what you like in your bowl and sauces they cook it up right in front of you you can stuff your bowl as much as you can dont worry about getting alot because all you pay for a take out box is 50 cents it is great for leftovers the food tastes fresh still The one in tempe was awesome as well I love this place I had one larg bowl a bowl of rice chicken soup and a soda for 1025 how can you go wrong with that
5,"Just go eat here Get the cheese curds I think they may be developing CCA cheese curd anonymous soon but until it becomes a diagnosable disease I will continue to indulge

Oh yah the Pine Steak is also fantastic and will probably also cause addictive like tendencies 

Oh oh oh  the chicken and waffles are also a pleasant surprise in the other wise repetitive and ordinary dining scene that is so often found in Phoenix 

Just do yourself a favor and go check this place out And try the home made ginger ale tonic or lemonade by them selves or mix it up with one of their top shelve spirits"
5,"When I moved to the Valley our first place was a rental in Old Town  The previous tenantowner generously left a bunch of takeout menus for nearby restaurants  Defalcos was one of them  But not being a fan of the sandwich it took me four years and a move to actually go in  What a fool I was  This place is fantastic  

First off its not just a deli its an Italian market  Had I actually read the full name of the place I might have known that  Its also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase  So now weve moved from a deli to a grocer to a wine shop  Dont forget the pasta dishes and the pastry too  

My fave sandwich is the tomato mozz and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic  Simple yet perfection  Im a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way  Crusty on the outside but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite yet soft and chewy on the inside  Its always about the bread for me  Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well  One of the best red potato salads Ive had in a long time

It certainly wont take me another four years to go back  I think Ive been there just about every week in the last month"
5,"Yo this is my favorite AJs here If you gots a beef with the prices then go somewhere else Actually the prices arent any higher than Safeway they just carry better and more expensive for them to buy products 

They have been great to me as far as ordering Rambutans when I have a whim or a craving The sandwich counter is awesome and I love the slices of pizza that are as big as my head The drink counter is stellar and they brew China Mist iced teas Every once in a while the Prickly Pear flavor comes up and Im so so so happy 

This store is much larger than the ScottsdaleLincoln location and the service here is friendlier than that location as well Shot out to Gerri at the floral counter she is teriffic as well as the produce manager who takes care of me every time You guys rock"
5,"Camus is a cute little trendy barrestaurant located in the Clarendon hotel  I came here for a business lunch awhile ago and really enjoyed it  We were one of two tables though so service was top notch  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer any and all questions we had

The chef even came out to say a hello which I found to be impressive  The calamari app was excellent and my dish of mushroom gnocchi was amazing I definitely recommend this place"
5,Great service
5,"Looking a cutting edge wanting the best for everyone type of pet boutique you must go to Oliver and Annies 

Chris the owner is amazing He knows his stuff and has the best of the best There is no pet boutique like his Urban chic and healthy top draw He is an amazing supporter of local artists and designers and an absolute delight to know and do business with His loving nature is endearing 

Its no surprise he just received the Best of Phoenix award"
5,"Have you ever tried the chicken rotisserie here They go fast so you have to be lucky to get one unless you call ahead Its not so much about the rotisserie chicken as it is about the amazing and creamy and smooth and exceptionally well balanced Garlic Saucespread they give you that goes along with the chicken 

Have I told you how amazing this spread is If only I knew the recipeI would eat it by the tubokay maybe by the spoonfuls Anywaytry the chicken rotisserie or the chicken taook Heck if you dont want to eat either of those thingsjust ask for some garlic sauce on the side with whatever you are eating You will not be disappointed"
5,I was thrilled to find my room huge sheets crisp and clean and the staff super friendly
5,I dined in Sol this past week and was amazed I am in the industry and have absolutely fell in love with this place The food is not only original but good an healthy I will say this though if you are looking for refried beans and mush on your plate this is not the mexican food for you It reminded me of time i have spent down the coast of mexico very wonderful I can see them still working out a few errors but they are very quick to fix any mistake the service i had was absolutely amazing it was nice to see someone like the tall good looking gentlemen i had wait on me he was funny and kept my table laughing and very informative overall i really had a sense during my meal he wanted nothing but the best for my table definitely somewhere i will be back too for sure especially since im craving that taco vampiro again
5,"Heres how to do Pizzeria Bianco the right way

1 Show up at 330 or earlier to get a good place in line Make sure you bring some friends to enjoy the time together and the great food
2 At 400 the bar opens Get yourself a bottle of wine and make the best of the 90 minutes youll spend just waiting to get on the seating list
3 Order a few appetizers from the bar theyre light and fresh and yummy
4 When you finally get seated for dinner dont hold back Order salads share different pizzas and have a coffee after

The quality of the food is ABSOLUTELY worth the wait We tried eating here a few times over the past couple of years but realized it takes commitment and two bottles of wine to make it through the line Best pizza Ive had since Italy Bravo Bianco"
5,Now that I have tried all the main bubble teaboba places in the Valley I can say that this place is the best and most consistent It therefore deserves five stars
1,We were so disappointed  We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted to try a Brazilian restaurant  It was nothing like the one we have had home  Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home  I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender  The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better  Besides being hard the meats didnt have much flavor  The salad bar was okay and I dont know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar  This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar  
5,"If its good enough for Britney its good enough for me  Which I guess isnt saying much these days  But trashy ole Brit knew what she was doing when she booked a room at Sanctuary  

This resort truely is a Sanctuarythe pool complete with negative edge inwater matching rafts for guests and a top notch waitstaff was my favorite spot  Had a gotten a chance to experience the spa which Ive heard is one of the best in town I may have taken up residence there

I stayed here as a reward for work with a bunch of girlswe had a suitea sweet suit eactually complete with 3 bedrooms kitchen living room etc  We even had a cute bellboy who watched parts of the NBA finals with us  Now thats service  

Plush robes a balcony with a perfect mountain view and egyptian cotton sheets  Loveitloveit

At night we went to Elements which is the very upscale restaurant and bar at the resort  It deserves its own review so Ill write a seperate one but know that its exceptional and the view is amazing  A great date spot for even those who arent spending the night at the hotel"
5,gotta be honest im not a wine drinker but came here to meet up with friends for a tasting the space is sleek yet cozy the staff is friendly and very earnest and knowledgable in their wine presentation
5,This is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants They carry the best bran muffin Ive ever hadit has a delicious brown sugar topping on it I love coming here on special occasions
1,"beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you dont drink tea  really

The crazy thing is im sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill

When I mentioned it to the cashier she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  oh is this your 1st time  we can remove it from the bill

I said forget it keep it

i usually tip 2030 but ill just let them keep their meager 65 per charge

  yeah really worth losing a customer for

my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water

gone are the 215 per item flat rate can you say bait and switch

235 PER so now theyre no different from the rest of the dim sum places

as sneaky as CFOO trying to strong arm the 15 gratuity which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers

so in a down economy youre supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges

its the chinese way i guess

back to china king for us  sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace

will you forgive us haha"
5,Updating my review after several weeks Appears maybe the managers read these reviews In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last reviewbut I am still watching
5,This is a true gem I took my dog there after bouncing around trying to find the right groomer for him I read the reviews and gave this place a try I was really happy with the customer service the service performed on my dog the fact I got a same day appt and most importantlymy dog did not seem to be anxious or uncomfortable He normally leaves a groomer stressed and not himself but he seemed to be at complete ease here
1,We had looked to buy a unit here  looked at several units then decided to rent for a while first  Weve been here almost a year  loved it at first but have had horrible noise problems for about 8 months  management wont do a thing about it   The walls here are paperthin  we our neighbor plays her music loudly at 3am almost every night  Its so loud that we had to move our bed to the other side of the room and run a humidifier all night just to try to block the noise but that doesnt work  Weve called security several times but it never seems to help  The ceilings are also very thin  you can easiy hear any walking above you   Aesthetically this place looks great  The gym is great too but the construction is horrible
5,Both of my girls have been enrolled in Marilyns studio and it has been a wonderful experience for our family  The teachers are engaging and creative and as a result both of my girls love to dance and my eldest daughter who is now 11 has been dancing with them since the age of 3  No stage moms here but rather a warm friendly environment where girls can develop their dance abilities free from the high pressure nature of some studios  Our family looks forward to many more recitals to come  Thanks Marilyn Bostic Ballet Centre for helping develop our daughters confidence and love for dance
1,I live down the street from Casey Moores I have been here a total of three times The first time a group of us just ordered drinks and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich Again it was so awful I had to send it back I am not a picky eater nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back So this place was already two for two Alas my husband begged me to go back once more He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house I figured it wouldnt hurt to give them one more shot It was last Thursday evening and the place was hoppin This time the food was decent Not good but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moores a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service But the service was HORRIBLE Our waitress got us our drinks and didnt come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by and though she passed us quickly several times she never even acknowledged us with a simple Ill be back with your orders When she did arrive 20 minutes later she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us She was very monotone and never smiled with us I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night but when she went to her other tables all full of men with drinks she suddenly lit up laughed and had a blast with them It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past But no This was our first time meeting her We were pleasant customers who didnt complain about the mediocre food or slow service We were polite and left a good tip We pride ourselves on being fun engaging and polite with our servers since we go out often But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars It is such a shame that Casey Moores has now given us three good reasons to never come back And I cant find any information on their website of how to contact the manager about this so I am left to rant here on Yelp completely unsatisfied Sigh
5,"Chai is alive and well and living at City Center at City North

I had been dating a gal name Starbucks for the past few years She was a plain gal generic if you will  She was dependable and available I was feeling as if i needed more out of my relationship as you can imagine 
So at times I would cheat on my gal with another gal named Coffee Bean Coffee Bean was Kosher and a bit edgier yet had a leaner list of qualities 

I needed more out of my relationships They say that when youre not looking for someone new they appear Well that was the case with my new crush named Press 

I had been to High Street for dinner Kona Grill yet most of the other shops and restaurants were closed or not yet open for business at the time 

I ventured back during daytime hours to give them another opportunity  I had heard about Press so I was more than excited to give it a go At this point I was still making caffeine a part of my diet so i ordered something called a Dirty Chai This was a Chai with espresso shots Press uses a powdered Chai which in my opinion works better than the liquid or tea bag forms I was also given the option to have my frothy delight in a ceramic cup  I opted for that  I felt like i was having the type of coffee house experience I had only just imagined 

Press occupies a well appointed space too  From the wood and granite to the stained concrete floors I felt as if i were in a European city not a Phoenix strip mall The free wifi is a major plus in my opinion 
Press goes as far as to have a dog friendly cart outside in its ample outdoor seating area 

I spoke with Steve the owner of Press at length  In talking I asked how Press came to be and he said that his wife had wanted to open a coffee shop one day  Well Steve you have certainly exceeded her expectations as well as the residents of the Greater Phoenix area 

By the way Press serves sandwiches and soups as well as an extensive list of wines 

Check it out the staff will make you feel at home or like youre on vacation in the cozy European city of your choice"
1,I am a huge tea drinker so when I found out about Teavana I was excited  I entered the store and an employee asked if I cared to try some tea After sampling several different blends I chose three to purchase  The employee asked if I wanted to get a large canister for a dollar more than the one I had picked Not realizing this store sells tea by the ounce rather than per canister I said sure He chatted as he filled the containers never mentioning the price and once done took my debit card and rang me up I didnt pay attention to the cost and when I looked at the receipt when I got home my heart nearly stopped I spent 350 on tea I returned it and they didnt give me too much trouble Now I always check the total before handing my card over and I wont go back I feel like they totally swindled me
5,"Umm is it possible to give MORE than 5 stars My girlfriend believes Duane is AMAZING and hands DOWN the best handyman ever We stumbled upon him and had him come to the house to fix a ceiling fan that had fallen out of the ceiling completely Yikes His charge was reasonable for coming by about 40ish and he really goes above and beyond especially with quality and letting you know the facts 

This was a house full of girls and often times when they are clueless they try to pull a fast one NOPE not Duane He is honest and very caring When he was leaving he noticed the door had a stick to it and brought back something from his vehicle and fixed it for free

Most recently my girlfriend called him at nearly 9pm to tell him her disposal stopped working He immediately remembered her as the house with the three dental students and exactly where she lived even though he had last been there a year ago and walked her through how to fix it over the phone for free 

This guy really is the epitome of what everyone wants and needs in a handyman Call him for ANY home issue you may need help with"
5,I walked here in the heat and was immediately greeted with an ice cold beer For free It was a delicious IPA and the staff couldnt have been friendlier There were even snacks I also had another sample of their Camelback ale Both were heaping samples almost a full cup The tour was fun and informative The co owner George even gave me and my boyfriend a ride to the lightrail stop We didnt bring our bikes So awesome  Definitely recommend Lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon
5,One of my favorite places to take my 3 and 4 year old Only drawback is it gets really crowded especially with the school groups so we call early to see how many school groups there are and then we decide if its worth it or not They sometimes host 500 kids at this museum and thats just not fun Other than that this place is amazing
5,I have stopped into Copper Star on previous occasions during street festivals but today was the first time I came to sit and study Man am I a fan of this place I am lucky that I live in a location where I have a multitude of options Lux Lola Hob Nobs SBUX etc but I have to say I really liked the vibe here The music wasnt loud the people relatively quiet and chill and I could actually focus on what I was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me I liked that while on a busy street 7th Ave the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on That added to the peace and quiet of it Employees were nice free wifi internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop and I enjoyed my small mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie both just under 7 I was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie which was soooo good if I might say They are open until 9pm on Sundays which is pretty cool I have yet to use their drive through for coffee but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to SBUX There is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool offyou can give your dog a bath at WagnWash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee
5,"Makes the job of shipping packages a lot less miserable
I can purchase any supplies needed heckthey will even fill out the forms
I come bring all my packages here ship them whatever method I want and get it all done without stressing

While I hate dealing with shipping things this place makes it even a bit fun with their service with a smile and fun conversation added in"
1,We came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees We were then informed that we couldnt order dinner Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they arehere for dinnerthey might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did closefourth time weve given this place a and got crappy service Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner Needless to say we wont be giving them another chance Not good Gordon B Not good
5,I came in for a gift for my boyfriends pleasure  The lady working there answered my questions thoroughly and professionally  Any shyness or awkwardness I might have felt disappeared  I was prepared to spend more for a different product but was steered to a better choice by this lady  Turns out my boyfriend was very happy with his gift  This was around Halloween so there were a lot more items than usual like costumes pasties fun things  I can wholeheartedly recommend this Fascinations
5,Yes this place can be a bit pricey however if you catch them at happy hour or on girls night out it can be very affordable The atmosphere and the specialness of the melting pot is unbeatable I have been there for intimate occasions and family birthdays Food is wonder especially the cheese The menu has changed a bit over the years and there are some oldies I would love to see return the mushroom salad but there is nothing that beats this place for any special occasion
5,A must for us when we visit Scottsdale  Whole family finds what they like and the burgers are fantastic Very well priced and easy to bring the family have some wings burgers a few beers and not break the piggy bank
5,Love this place I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here They serve quality gourmet food And they have a full bar too Place is clean and service is great Would go back anytime
5,Great service good beer AMAZING burger and yummy sweet potato fries  This place is an awesome bar food venue with a cool interior design not too pricey or pretentious
5,I cant believe I havent yelped about the place yet Several months maybe over a year ago my husband read a newspaper article about the Clover coffee maker and the one place in town that had managed to procure one I was skeptical as is my nature It cant be that much better right Youre just saying its amazing because you want to talk about the new hot coffee shop you discovered right Well maybe But I love this place And I dont think it has a whole lot to do with the Clover They roast their own beans and they roast them way differently than that other ginormous coffee chain  all a light or medium roast Never bitter never oily never yucky The coffee they make there is obviously the best But I send my husband in every week now to buy a pound of beans so that I can approximate the same coffee at home Add an edgy though sometimes intimidating seating area great local art which we bought off the wall and smiley serviceIm sold Cant wait to try out the downtown location
5,Heard about this restaurant from a friend and I was amaze by the food and their friendly service I tried the chicken adobo and it was amazing The chicken came apart with no effort and it had a great honey glazed taste The portions were a good amount for their low prices I couldnt  get enough of their amazing dessert
5,"Had to update because weve now tried the pizza For all the times we have visited weve never tried a pizza too many other really good options to choose I guess

We ordered the Italian Classic veggies  meat We ordered it a little well donecrispy and were not disappointed It was hot fresh and cooked perfectly 

Service was great as usual even though they were completely SLAMMED with customers the day before Thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time

We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items  eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans potatoes two eggs and fresh warm tortillas  It was fantastic This dish just like many others possibly ALL others is plenty for 2 to share 

Service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and AZ won  so there were a lot of happy customers that day"
5,"A big shout out to Mike the stupendously stellar bar manager  I will be back to discuss the history of Vodka

Thank you to restaurant GM Anibal who stopped by to see us not once but twice  Enjoyed the education regarding the secretive life of truffles 

Aaron the fantastically knowledgeable Sommelier had me paired with excellent wine suggestions with only a few hints of my picky palette  

Appreciated the Manger of Stone Rose Sam  coming all the way over from the other side to dropped in and sat with us to chat about upcoming events

Cant wait to go back to try out there new bar bite menu in 2 weeks and take advantage of the locals secret  12 off bottle night on Tuesdays from there amazingly huge book of wines to choose from  

Thanks again everyone you made a potentially disastrous date night from visiting an establishment previous which to say the least did not go well into a very enjoyable and fun evening"
1,"Disclaimer I am a Thai person and a Thai food connoisseur 

This is supremely average Thai food and overpriced as heck to take advantage of White People Sorry to be blunt but thats all it is 18 dishes that are 8 at a real Thai restaurant The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers They dont have

If you like spicy skip it for sure Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand 

Tiny servings

The good Friendly wait staff

If authentic Thai is what youre looking for try any of these Palees Crown Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill"
5,"Im very new to PHX I ended up talking to a cop at the airport who told me about Thursday Rockabilly nights at the Blooze I had to check it out My friend and I walked in and were instantly comfortable excited and impressed The AC was pumping beer was cold the music rockin and the crowd refreshing The bathroom was great 
They dont have food there but they will let you bring in whatever you want We went there pretty early around 730ish Unfortunately because of ridiculously early work on Fri AM I had to leave once it was starting to get really packed and lively around 103011 I am so glad that I finally checked the place out though I will definitely frequent The Blooze as often as I can"
5,Finally wellqualified wellestablished mechanics that dont talk to me like Im a dumb carignorant girl  even if I am I was sitting at a desk establishing an estimate for my Honda within 20 minutes of calling them The receptionist was polite and efficient but truly the best part was their interactive transparent estimate process I was able to view the screen as my estimator drag and dropped the parts he suspected I would need into a spreadsheet Then I saw him calculate the labor hours  something I had NEVER been privy to before Tracys Auto Body was affordable very quick and went above and beyond  alerting me to other pieces that were loose and fixing them for free I highly recommended their services They have a perfect record since the mid1980s with BBB and with good reason
5,So I was like a lemming trying this after Man vs Food when recently visiting Phoenix  But  the kid is right everything on the Del Rey torta works together  And it is HUGE  And its great too  Wonderfully constructed just enough of everything and not too much of anything  I also had the watermelon juice interesting huh  One strange thing first Mexican restaurant Ive ever been in that didnt have chips and salsa  Only real downside is that the service is a bit slow  But theyre slammed and deservedly so
5,are you joking Where else can you get the best salami ham any cold cuts anywhere I just moved here 6 months ago and have been searching for a place like this Their meats are fantastic I discovered this place after driving by it so many times thought Id take a chance Location is awful but worth the trip
5,"Excellent place  I have eaten here several times and the place is always busy  The sushi is good and you can order things that are not on the menu if you know what you want  I have a friend who works for Intel with a lot of Asians and they frequent this place a lot which is how I came to discover this place 

The prices are good and are much cheaper than the RA or Kona when you take into account how big the portions are"
5,TJ was there for me when my water heater broke and started flooding my garage  He walked me through fixing it over the phone until he was able to send some help to my house  Very grateful and I will continue referring

5,"Wait were in Arizona
 No seriously this is Arizona
I had to keep blinking cause I couldve sworn we were still in the East Bay last Friday night as we waited for our faux meat meals to arrive at our table 

My hubster and I were visiting his mom for the first time since she had moved to Phoenix and admittedly neither of us were too stoked on the visit We totally wanted to see her but as for Phoenix Anyways she knew what she was doing by taking us straight from the airport to Green 

I LOVED EVERYTHING From our appetizers hummus  fries to my entree I had the chicken curry noodle bowl to my beverage a suicide mixture of their house green tea and house limeade YUM to my soy ice cream treat I had the mint with paul newman oreos which I scarfed down after being totally stuffed This place is ridiculously good And reasonably priced And fresh And not stuffy or pretentious in anyway Basically this would be our new steady if we lived anywhere near Tempe Which fortunately we do not but I have to say you Arizonians sure are stoked to have a place like Green
And now we have a reason to look forward to returning to AZ D"
5,My six year old daughter and I enjoyed a fun and memorable date night at Melting Pot last night It was her first exposure to fondue and we had a blast eating great food and talking about her first three days of first grade We starteed with a fantastic spinach and artichoke fontina  butterkäse cheese fondue then shared the Land  Sea filet mignon chicken and shrimp Of course when the dessert menu came out so did a bit more enthusiasm She had never dreamed of seeing a pot of melted chocolate before The looks on her face were priceless She chose the Cookies n Cream Marshmallow Dream and it was crazy good Im looking forward to taking the whole family and to making this a more common stop on our date night calendar
5,Have eaten here several times  Always amazing
5,Love the buffet the folks that work there are great we usually hit this at least once a weekend and our table is always ready and he knows what sort of naan we want Small but worth it
5,Great selection of gelato Friendly welcoming staff Reasonably priced deliciously rich gelato
5,The BEST brewery Ive ever been to Amazing beer and awesome food I didnt think that combo was actually possible I daydream about this place all the time since I spent so much time here while going to school at ASU Whenever I go back to Phoenix this is always a must on my list
5,"I have been here countless times since my last review and found myself here for a quick drink and some appetizers last night  I took a huge hiatus as I was in Michigan for a month and then have been crazy busy since arriving back in Phoenix and transitioning into a new job I was sad because I thought they wouldve forgotten me  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did not forget me at all  I love that

We grabbed some brews and shared the patatas bravas a personal favorite and the mushroom appetizer  The mushroom appetizer was heavy on the cheese but still a tasty bite  The patatas bravas really never fail they remind me of my Moms version of french fries  

Id highly recommend this place for a date it seems to pay off in more ways than one  Always great service and interesting eats still lovin Tuck Shop for being in my neighborhood"
5,"Was not expecting such a wonderful meal in a shopping center After some shopping my husband and I were starvingthis was the first place we stumbled upon that was still serving their lunch menu at 330pm For starters we tried the calamarideliciouslovely deep fried lemon and zucchini pieces amongst the calamari pieces

For mains we both tried the tomato and basil soupvery tasty The veal meatball that my husband had and that I had to sample was also very goodsmothered in a nice tangy rich sauce My vegetarian pizza was the best one I have had in yearssuper fresh ingredients on a very tasty base

For dessert the gelato profiteroles smothered in chocolate sauce were simply devine

Needless to say we loved this place not just due to the amazing food but also the atmosphere may be in a shopping area but still nice and cozy and the great staff who were very friendly

Will probably dine here every shopping trip  "
5,"Went back with some veggie friends of mine and wasnt disappointed  One of them ordered the regular flour quesadilla and they loved it  It had veggie stuff on the inside and I tasted a bite which was delicious  I will probably order this next time I go  Also the grilled onion which came on the side was a big hit  The other friend ordered the mushroom corn quesadilla  She liked it but didnt love it  I had the shrimp tacos and wow were they good  

I dont know why with all the tortas on the menu but I just seem to prefer the other menu items  As always the service was great and it was very very busy  We had to wait to be seated  

Love this place"
5,"How have I not reviewed this place on Yelp

I reviewed them for Check Please Arizona a PBS review show httpwwwazpbsorgcheckplease I could at least do a written review 

Ive eaten at FEZ so many times I cant count anymore I think their burgers are some of the best Ive ever had in the valley Always juicy I think the square patties are adorable 

The FEZ burger with its molasses bbq cinnamon pears feta providing fireworks for the tounge Their Douxelle burger with sauteed mushrooms provolone cheese   mustard resulting in a subdued but delicious burger

 Their fries which include normal sweet potato harissa  garlic are also great but I love the salad that comes default including their lemon dressing 

If burgers  fries arent your thing they have Kisras think like pizza minus the cheese and their daily specials are amazing 

One time I was lucky enough to score the mushroom risotto and it was perfect  Sugar snap peas 

Drinks are fantastic too A margarita that doesnt taste like chemicals perfect martinis and a GSpotgrapefruit pom and vodka make FEZ a perfect place for lunch or dinner"
5,Great food Good prices
1,"Look it upsets me that you have to give even one star 

I can read the other reviews and I have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner 

Yes we were the table of 7 people at about 8pm yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together You would have to remember us because we were the table that had 12 of a waiter It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch 

You know what sucks more than working 2 shifts How about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts it was so nice of the manager to let him leave but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders 

Simply the food was not good and you are over priced

But the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring"
1,"One star would be giving it a holiday gift

For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation Unfortunately Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement

My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs They were extremely overcooked  There was more charcoal on the top back and ends that was just not editable  Once you scraped away the charcoal on the tops ends and the center ribs there was one that was eatable 

The company offered me a second chance to try their food by giving me a complementary full slap  Nothing had improved
They say they smoke the ribs but there was no odor to that effect In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed
Btwthe waitress at the front counter couldnt even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were When I asked if they were smoked cooked daily she said some are if you get here early  others were from the refrigerator from last night The so called dryrub seasoning was tasteless The BBQ sauce is major strange

The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging 14Half for 6 bones and 26Whole 1213 bones both with sides I have high hopes for the brisket but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor

Overall if they dont change the way they burn the ribs run run or drive real fast to another place  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it

Honey Bears My Mothers or even driving to Famous Daves is well worth the trip
Sorry to burst your bubble I too had high hops for a centrally located rib place  

Im still waiting"
5,"Fine dining is not just a setting  it isnt just good food  It is many things that add up to an attitude I have had the opportunity to find it in different cities I found it the other night at the Stockyards

We were seated by a host who took us to our table and when we were properly seated gave us menus  Our server came to the table and introduced herself and said she would return shortly  It was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering  When she did return  our glasses were fillednot something we should have  to wait for her to do when the service is right  She knew the selections on the menu and all available options and could make sensible comments concerning them  Our salads were served promptly by two additional people and were as fresh as I could ask for  When my friend was finished with hers they asked if they could take her plate  I was pleased when they didnt ask me if I was finished with my salad and could they take my plate  If Id been finished I could have told them  We were able to continue our conversation uninterrupted as I finished my salad  The salad plate was removed  when it was appropriate and we had a few minutes before the entrees were served  All was in keeping with a relaxed dining  At no time did I have to think about having drinks refilled it just happened quietly

After a few minutes our dinners were served by the two gentlemen and our server appeared to make sure they were to our satisfaction before we started  There was no room for error there that couldnt be resolved before we started  

My friend had ordered a small steak My friend is  quite elderly and Kathy our server discretely asked her if shed like it cut for her  A potato also was served with her dish  I asked my friend which of the condiments she would like it prepared with  She look at me and said Prepared with She didnt understand what I was getting at but Kathy did and was already reaching for the potato   She opened the potato and smiled while my friend said a bit of everything  One doesnt go to a restaurant like the stockyards to have to deal with opening a hot potato and preparing it   When serving is done properly these things dont have to be discussed  Kudos to Kathy  That is part of the fine dining experience

I had a full rack of ribs which were so tender the meat fell of them  The sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed  I also can tell you that unless you are a big eater half a rack would fill most people  My friend said Yummy  and I agreed  I am used to getting a finger bowl for clean up after eating but I cant complain about the two extra napkins and several ways of cleaning my fingers that accompanied my ribs  

My friend let them know we were celebrating the 17th anniversary of my 39th birthday so they served me a free desert  I can assure you the pecan pie is a delight  Warm and laced with brandy it was perfect way to finish our dinner

The stockyards I might mention is not inexpensive but what an enjoyable way to spend your money They do offer two dinner specials you wont find at most other places  They do have a luncheon menu that has lower prices   Dont expect chrome and music that is a bit to loud as many of the new places offer  Instead just enjoy a time and place where they pamper you as you should be when you go to the Stockyards

I dont consider the stockyards to be a place you where shorts and Nikes but of course there are always a few  I would say a nice shirt and slacks at least"
5,i love this place i can always spent all my money here on something  they have great sales racks but also reasonable clothes not on sale too the atmosphere is always chill and the people working are super friendly Also if you get bored of shopping for clothes they have random stuff like board games and books you can buy
5,I spent almost 2 years searching for a good nail salon in the North Scottsdale area and I will never go anywhere else again  It is very clean the girls are very nice and they always do a really good job on my nails  They are upfront about their pedicure prices  they hand you a price sheet that tells you exactly what you get for each upgrade  instead of pressuring you into getting something better and then upcharging you  I think their prices are super reasonable as well  For the best pedicure and a french gel manicure I pay 70  I usually make appointments Sunday mornings are nicely uncrowded but Ive also walked in and been taken fairly quickly  I love this place and will recommend it to anyone who asks
5,I love vegetarian restaurants I support them 200 So glad this place exists in Phoenix The quality of the food is beyond excellent The meals are creative and super tasty Never disappointed The only qualm I have is the service Itisslow Whether its the time it takes for my meal to reach my table or the cashier taking my order to ring it up correctly The length of time it takes should not be so long Prices are a bit steep but most vegetarianvegan restaurants are priced a bit higher than others I dont mind paying more for quality Overall this place is a favorite weekend visit I cant wait for my next meal at Pomegranate Cafe
5,Ruths Chris the only steak house I can fully endorse  500 degree plates make the sizzle a memorable experience  The Ahi tuna appetizer is also a must have to start the meal off right  While every salad they have is a cant miss Ill go there just to get the Chop Salad
5,Place is always friend and I LOVE THE PIZZA     Its by far my favorite pizza place   Sign up on their VIP newsletter or eclub and you get a free pizza on your birthday get it for free and try it     Sounds good to me
5,"Quite possibly the best place to eat in Mesa Let me tell you what you are in for if you go 

The CPC has taken these pilgrim pockets to the next level  Personally I would recommend The Royale With Cheese or the Shepards Pie The pies take a while to make so now would be a good time to order drinks as well If you are the beer drinking type I would suggest the Hoegaarden its the best Ive ever had If you are looking for something more stimulating you may want to try their Irish Car Bombs Or if you are you are up to it go with both

When your pasty arrives dont touch the plate It could be scorching bloody hot Your pasty is probably going to take a few minutes to become edible as well just stay clam it will cool soon enough 

When you have finished eating get the apple stuffed pasty for desert By now you will feel very full I know I do it every time and the only thing I can say is that it was worth it

Cheers"
5,"Weve been going to Santisi for close to 10 years since they are just around the corner from my house Weve never had a bad item here Its a fun place to go and the food is great We always order pizza which is consistently good Their salads are excellent  all their ingredients are very fresh and theres enough for two meals if youre a lighter eater And the wings are always excellent 

Weve always had good service and the staff keeps the beverages coming Its a great place to watch a game  if you can get in Friday and Saturday nights are so crowded we often grab a beer while we wait for our takeout pizza The parking can be a challenge since the stripes are laid out weird and theres a dollar theater next door You can park in back the side toward the freeway if theres no room in the front

We moved away in 2006 and came back in 2010 and Santisi was still there and as good as ever"
5,Oh Chipotle I love you  Healthy options even when craving Mexican  My favorite is the chicken burrito bowl with fajita veggies  Served on a bed of rice with black beans and pico de gallo with some spicy corn thrown inahh my mouth is watering already  Ive been to many locations and all are clean food quality is excellent service is friendly and professional and I always leave satisfied  5 stars to you my friend
5,"These are simply the BEST sandwiches and salads If you like your food a locally grown b freshly made c organicall natural and d yummy  and who doesnt  this is the place for you

Now admittedly they have something of a soupnazi routine set up and if you walk in and dont know the drill it can be confusing  So pay attention   
1  Look at menu
2  Decide what you want
3  Wait your turn to order
4  Order give your name
5  Wait your turn to be called to pay the other girl for the order you placed
6  Pay her
7  Wait until your food is ready
8  Leave with your food

Note that there is no place to sit inside  so you can either sit outside or if it is 157 degrees out that day see if you can find a place to sit over at LUX they are very welcoming of Pane Bianco diners 

Its all good"
5,Delicious clean great service 3 hours later and we are still talking about how delightful this place was We had the pulled pork and chicken sandwich  both were moist and fresh Dinner for 2 for 2000
5,"I love this second location in the Royal coffee series as much as the one at the market

Since its summer  I thought I should mention that the iced coffee is so smooth and amazing that you dont even have to add anything to it Dont believe me  Ask for a sample next time you are here and I guarantee you will be astounded

A quiet and chill atmosphere if you want to workstudyread as well as a great place for delicious grab n go coffee in the Biltmore area"
5,"TIP 1 to MesaGateway fliers This is the ONLY bar at the airport so live itlove it 
Food is great The burgers can be made lowcarb  especially great this gurl 
TIP 2 Food can be ordered to go"
5,"Truly a great owner who cares about his customers   I highly recommend a visit if you like one of a kind quality piecesyoung yet classic tasteful yet funky

5,Im so in love with this place  I tried the pepperoni pizza and I was AMAZED i love that they have a fresh herbvegetable garden in the front  Its all about the FRESH ingredients these days  I cant wait to go back and try different dishes Id like to try the cheese platters  mouth watering as we speak  going again to day so Ill keep adding to this review STAY TUNED BTW the decor reminds me of the VIG but definitely more spacious dining area
1,This place was just okay First Id like to say that my bridal consultant dont remember her name  sorry was really nice and helpful But to me most of the other saleswomen had desperation all over their faces dont know if they work off of commission or if the higher ups are just slave laborers or what but Im sure some of them wouldve killed for a sale I found a few dresses I liked but they were way too high pressure for me to be able to make a solid decision on the spot so I decided to wait on it I ended up finding a dress I liked better for about 13 of the price somewhere else I notified Davids Bridal thanks but no thanks about 6 months ago To this day I still get calls to my cell phone asking me to come back in and try on the dress theyre like the telemarketers of the bridal world So annoying Plus their accessories are so expensive and very cookie cutter Id go somewhere else unless youre new to this and need some ideas
5,Tried this restaurant with a groupon Probably would not have if I didnt have the coupon Dont let the storefront and decor stop you from going in The restaurant is super clean and the wait staff is very friendly And the food WOW  We split the Shrimp Ceviche and the combination pupusa plate The portions were very generous I ordered the fruit drink Everything was absolutely delicious One of my new favorite restaurants  Will definitely be back
5,Intense
1,"I really wish I had a dagger to stab myself in the face for trying to eating here Absolutely the WORST PLACE in the entire valley I would turn around and go ask for my money back but I am to embarrassed to even be seen in the drive through again 

Was on my way home thought I would give it a shot I ordered random items chicken taco and onion rings The taco was like eating out of a horse trough It fell apart immediately and I found myself trying to shovel it into my mouth After about two bites I realized the meat was questionably chicken The onion rings were so blah I didnt even touch them 

Please do your self a favor Dig in the nearest dumpster for lunch then go home and pound a bottle of vegetable oil It sure beats the hell out of this joint No joke"
5,A great little spot to find Fresh Fresh Fresh Sushi and great eats Be sure to try the green bean appetizer
1,"We had read good things about Over Easy and were excited to try it out We went a few days after Christmas and were horribly disappointed

When we walked in we were seated by one server Then a few minutes later another host came up to us and asked why we stole a table and did we not understand how seating works We were quite confused and offended as we were seated properly and had done nothing wrong

Then once we ordered we waited over 45 minutes for our food Finally we asked about it and then it was out within a few minutes They had completely lost our order

When our food arrived one dish the Over Easy  toasted brioche with spinach  an egg was absolutely inedible The brioche was so burnt that we could barely cut it as was the bacon The fried egg was very undercooked even though we requested it completely cooked through I was honestly shocked the server brought us the dish without saying anything since it was clearly burnt

The other 2 dishes banana  pecan french toast and the Loretta sandwich were just alright  certainly nothing to rave about And the 3 of us ended up splitting these 2 dishes since the other dish was awful We ended up leaving early because we were all so disappointed At which point our server asked if wed like a box for our uneaten burnt brioche It would have been much more appropriate for her to ask if there was something wrong with it since it was obviously not eaten

Anyway Im not sure if we just caught them on a bad day but I would never go back again or recommend Over Easy to anyone else"
5,"This is place IS Beer Heaven  Over 100 taps of amazing beers This is the ONLY place I will purchase several beers at full price not on happy hour 
Amazing thing 2  for the girls they have a shorty glass which is a 9oz glass instead of 12oz it is a beautiful thing Now I can order two different kinds of beer without getting overly full er bloated instead of the two big 12oz glasses 
Amazing thing 3  The food is delish My boyfriend and I split a burger Bad idea It was so good we really didnt want to share it afterall 
Amazing thing 4  The staff are awesome There are several staff behind the bar and ALL are happy and willing to help you if your initial server is MIA They are very attentive friendly and helpful if you cant decide  
Amazing thing 5  The atmosphere is awesome and the music they play is great"
5,As far as fast Japanese food at lunch this is as good as it gets  They have a different Bento Box lunch special everyday  The box comes with plenty to eat including Miso Soup which arrives shortly after ordering  The meal includes sushi salad rice chicken teriyaki or such gyoza some type of fried fish and an orange  For about 810 its hard to find a better deal  I would highly recommend CherryBlossom for those looking for a Japanese meal  It is small quiet and a little hard to see from the street which makes it a unique place with low traffic but high quality
5,"I frequent RnR quite a bit for happy hour  Ive been here tons of times since I moved to AZ  Definetly one of the best happy hours in old town  Happy hour from 47 LOVE IT I get mad when places are 36 who gets off work that early  And pretty every drink is on special during happy hour  Really cheap wine beer and liquor  
Ya their food isnt orgasm AMAZING but its pretty good  Ive havnt disliked anything Ive tried there  
I love the atmosphere and outdoor patio on both levels
Ive been for breakfast too and the bottomless mimosas are wonderful  They keep em coming  The food is good breakfast food  
I take familyfriends from out of town here for happy hours
I love this place I dont get what the hate is about"
5,Nice casita that can sleep 6 for 99 plus free breakfast What a deal Service was excellent but the catered food was TERRIBLE
5,I have had a couple of peels at APeeling Faces and they were the best Ive ever had  They are not only very reasonable priced but Darla Salem really knows her stuff  My skin has never looked better  I am very pleased
5,Had a fantastic experience Hernan our server was excellent Knowledgable and charming The food was fantastic The chefs selection meat and cheese tray was insane Crazy flavor Well done
5,Oh my goodness Hank is awesome Weve had nothing but problems with landscapers and we finally found someone well be sticking with Hank is very professional knowledgeable responsive prompt communicates thoroughly and is very reasonable  And by the wayhes actually there doing the work Trust me weve gone through them all and I had almost given up hope  Hank has been better than expected  we almost dont want to tell anyone so he doesnt get too busy for us  
5,"Some of the best pizza Ive had in Phoenix I prefer to get takeout since the inside is a littleeh but who cares if the foods good I love the crust crispy and slightly chewy The pizza can be a little greasy sometimes but hey its pizza but as long as it doesnt soak through and make the crust all flimsy which has never happened with the pizzas I get here its nothing that a paper towel or two cant fix Im not a big wing person but my dad has had them and he says theyre pretty good

The staff has always been superfriendly and they actually remember me even though I only come in once every couple months"
5,Los Olivos is a Scottsdale institution and I wont hear a word against them Especially not when I have a few margaritas in me They take good care of regulars especially at Happy Hour The chips and salsa are delicious and they keep them coming I recommend the mini menu they are a great way to sample stuff if you like to try a lot of different things but my favorite meal is definitely the Chicken Poblano Mmm so good The shrimp chimi is also fantastic I never leave without feeling totally stuffed
5,I finally found a reasonably priced salon and a stylist who understands what I want  Very happy with the service  Also the waxing lady is very niceI think her name is Maria does good eyebrows  Only downside is that sometimes it is hard to get an appointment on short noticebut thats my fault for waiting until I cant stand it anymore to get my hair cut
5,One of a kind place to experience all senses  Food was great service was great AND they have a Moroccan Healer on staff  Ask to taste the Moroccan Black Stone not on normal menu  I wont spoil how it makes you feel but trust me when I say you will enjoy yourself 
5,This place is absolutely amazing  If you are looking for a quick sweet treat this is the place to go  It a little holeinthewall looking place but once you take a bite into one of their homemade ice cream sandwiches your mind will change  I usually go for the mint ice cream with chocolate chip cookie but when its fall I cant pass up the pumpkin ice cream with snicker doodle cookie Ive never found anything like it since
5,"Oh where to begin

I stopped by Pappadeaux last week to grab a bite when on a Wed they told me it was a 45min wait for two wow  The place was packed   The hostess recommended we make a reservation for the weekend so we made one for Friday at 7PM

The smells coming from the place when you first pull in automatically keep you wondering what delicious things are waiting inside  

Im so glad we did 

We showed up and they gave us a card with a number and once our number showed up on the screen it was seating time  I think we waited maybe ten minutes

After gazing over the menu for a quick minute we decided to try the fried alligator with creole sauce  Being one to enjoy new things I was pretty excited  The waiter took our drink orders and and put in the appetizer  The place at this point was insanely packed but it was nice to see a place like this  Made ya feel that something good was to come  Heck a place cant suck if its this packed right   So we order our food I decided on the stuffed shrimp and the rest of my friends all ordered different things  It would be a shareameal night 

About 10min into drinks and conversation they bring out the fried alligator  Ok if youve never eaten anything weird before  Please please youve got to try this  It sorta reminded me of a cross between soft pork or chicken  The taste literally melted in my mouth  To top it off the creole sauce that went with it only complimented it  I could easily have eaten the entire plate alone  Sadly I had to share

After quickly destroying the fried alligator we got our entrees  I took one bite and had to pause a moment the taste of the stuff shrimp with the crab Alfredo spices inside just floored me  There were only six pieces but after sharing a piece or two and eating the amazing green beans this was plenty of food 

I cant wait for my next trip here fantastic food"
5,"DV Nail may I help you YES You can  and always well Ive been going to DV Nails for years and theyre great Ive cheated on them a few times when I hear of similar nail shops in the area offering specials and mini hot stone massages with a manicure but I always end up back at DV Nail 

Their massage chairs are wonderful  strong massagers You actually feel like youre getting worked on Theyre clean friendly and always do a great job for the price Its not fancy by any means and I wish theyd turn on the radio instead of the fuzzy TV but theyre consistently good They carry every Essie  OPI color and my manicures always last a long time A manicure  pedicure is 28 total  tip I think thats great 

I typically request Tina or Julie  they both take their time and do great Dont be fooled by this place theres often a long wait Id recommend an appointment"
5,"I will give this place a 5th star even though i wait for 30 mins every time i go that can only mean its good right Well its that friendly AND that good that i dont mind waiting i hope it doesnt lose that customer service aspect that makes it so approachable 

best sausage gravy in town with a nice spice to it im not fond of their potato has thingys but their bfast nachos are fab and their white out omelette is also very tasty my favorite item  turkey sausage eggs benedict DD style trade sausage gravy for hollandaise  very filling as you can imagine 

breakfast club will still be the old town brunch location for when visitors come visit me but for week in and week out sunday morning brunch this is my spot"
1,"Its a supermarket  I just go in buy what I need and get out  Its convenient that theres a wells fargo in there but theres one across the street as well  

To the negative experience
My sister was speaking to my niece but not in english  Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says Cant you speak english  WTF  Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands  Its like youre trying to make every race hate you even more  I will run into this arrogance wherever I go

Im not done yet  Keep on reading
My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine  We know you have to be of a certain age to play it  One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she cant play it  Calm down  Kids are just innocent and dont need this extra verbal abuse in their lives  Dont you have something better to do like restock the shelves  Swear Racial profiling"
5,We came here Sunday morning for a wonderful breakfast Our server was Colleen She was very attentive and we had  a great meal The menu is so extensive with many many options I got Florentine Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had a fabulous omelet with potatoes and toast They were both delish     Their Potatoes are fab   The Decor was very nice and even though they were so busywe did not wait long at all for our table  Big parking lot and a nice waiting area as well We will defiantly come back here soon
5,"I love Christmastime and I especially love it because I know that Luminarias is back and this year its better than ever The staff and volunteers at the DBG do an excellent job of directing guests through the garden Between the welllit paths with Luminarias of course helpful staff and amazing acts this is an event not to be missed I consider this to be the ultimate activity for adults Its romantic if youre on a date its festive if youre with your family and its just pure fun if youre with friends 

You enter the park to be immediately greeted by hundreds of meowganificant Luminarias lighting up the entire garden Cocktail stations lie in every knook and cranny and they serve delicious festive drinks like my favorite hot cocoa and raspberry vodka If youre hungry they sell food throughout the garden at two locations Then there are the performers The DBG does an amazing job of bringing in musicians of every shape and size Whether its a trio of Christmas carolers a mariachi band or a lively Jazz band they have bands in every corner lighting up the night I am also continuously impressed with the acoustics of the garden With so many live acts in one area you can barely hear a specific act until you are in that area Their event planners did an amazing job 

Luminarias is my favorite Arizona activity during the holidays and I cant wait to go back next year"
5,"One word can describe the food here  perfection

All the meals Ive had here has been absolutely delicious served by the most charming waitstaff

Someone recently told me their Chilean Sea Bass was the best hes ever had and I believe him    I cant wait to taste that dish"
5,"All I have to say is WOW This place is EXCELLENT   All the dishes we had were extremely fresh authentic and DELICIOUS  

My favorite pot stickers EVER  The skin is super thin tender not greasy mostly steamed encased around a very light delicate dumpling that makes me want to order 2 next time 6 is just not enough they are tiny but oh so delectable The sauce is perfectly balanced of sweet spicy and tangy and does not overpower the pot sticker  It also comes with a thin airy crispy rice chip underneath the pot stickers that give it an extra texture with scallions scattered about  MMMMMMmmmmm

The green curry is more brothy than others than others that I have had but no matterIt is delicious with bits of vegetable and whatever meat you preferwe got chicken  I love sopping it up with rice and trying to eat it with chopsticks  You may need a spoon  

The eggplant and chicken stir fry is also fabulous  The asian eggplants are cooked to perfection Their sauces are spot on  

BEST Coconut ice cream  It is light fluffy icy dreamy peanutty coconut cloud confection that makes my mouth water  It is not sickly sweet sticky artificial coconut tasting at allPredominant coconut flavor is not my favorite and I LOVE THIS 

Even if you dont like curries there is plenty of food here that will make you a fan  This is a mom and pop kind of place they are really nice  Its a trek for us but definitely worth the drive"
5,"I really like this bar  restaurant  I usually come here to meet up with a friend and sit at the main bar  It is modern and clean  There are a couple bars to sit at and they even open a big door to a bar for the outside too  They have some good brews on tap and have flat screen tvs as well  

I have only had a burger and fries here  They burger was really good the fries were really greasy and were just okay

The staff here is friendly  speedy  I would recommend this place for a good place for someone looking for a nice place to grab a drink and converse"
5,Really nice  Im new to the area and I stumbled upon them  They are fast and not very expensive  I was a little turned off by the number of really old men working there but they had their regular client list  It was like one side was old men hair stylists and the other side was the young girl stylists  The two sides didnt really associate which I found rather weird  But none the less a great hair style at a great price
1,"This may be my worst dining experience ever

The scenery was beautiful we cant complain about that The menu was decent there was a good number of selections to choose from However the prices were definitely high were just talking tacos  burritos here

I ordered a taco salad with steak It was 1199 for lunchwhich I thought was crazy  When I got the salad it was the cheap iceberg lettuce with a couple tomatoes  a few onions The steak was DISCUSTING I wouldnt feed a dog that steak meat I asked the waiter for some salad dressing he gave me this funny look and said most people just use salsa but I guess I can get you some ranch or something Great service huh I asked the waiter about the margarittas and he willingfully told me that the 3 cheapest ones are no good and are too watered down Niceso I then asked about the Patron Margaritta my fav tequilla The Patron rita was 16 

The waiter was extremely unprofessional and even gave us this pitch about how hes only working there until he finds a new gig The prices were ridiculous I would NEVER go there again and hope to share my story with many people before they waste their money"
5,Stayed at the hotel from 1118 till 112312 Excellent hotel and the stuff was great Originally was supposed to come during Hurricane Sandy and couldnt fly out as I was affected by the storm The hotel staff had no problem changing my reservation and didnt even change the price Everything was great The room was clean The pool was excellent
1,Completely shady  Towed our Uhaul as we were moving in to our new Apartment Complex  Completely unethical and total crooks  AVOID AT ALL COSTS
5,"I just revisited Cheese N Stuff this weekend after a while  I guess just eat during their limited hours very often  They close very early 4pm

I love their liverwurst sandwiches and the Bismark but this time I decided to try the Doughboy people speak of minus mayo as I do not enjoy warm sandwich lubrication  As ever the place is tiny homey and spotlessly clean  I had some of the hot German Potato salad as a side and a ginger ale   All were yummy delicious and satisfying 

 As I was eating I had a yen for a Celery Soda to go with this classic sandwich but Ive only been able to get them at Chompies in the valley  There are loads of interesting European cookies to get packages of as dessert so grab a couple of friends when you go but carpool as the lot is smallish  I guess they stopped giving pickles with sandwiches bummer"
1,OMG what is the rave about this place is disgusting its dirty and the food is not worth it i came here with my family and we each order a little bit of everything that is suppose to be good and popular there unfortunately everything is bad i walked by the waiters and they were all cursing really loud in vietnamese to each other the table is icky and it smell like my cooked up oil  ick go to Pho ao sen instead at least its clean
5,"Food Truck Fav right here

Ive been wanting to try Pizza Peoples Pizza for a while now  I found out they were setting up at 180 Degrees Automotive and I figured if Bogi was hosting them then I needed to check them out  I finally caught up with them at Local Fest

Bogi was actually there helping them out and she told me that they were only sampling the regular pizza and the gluten free pizza was 8 but she assured me it was yummy  First of all 8 for a 2 item gf crust pizza is a deal  Secondly Bogi said they were her some of her best friends in the worldand I trust her implicitlyso I ponied up my dollars and waited about six minutes  I ordered my pie with pepperoni and fresh tomato  I took it back to my table to share with my Mama who is also gluten free and we both said at about the same time  Oh my gosh this is really good   Something Ive only said about twice since eating gf pizza

The sauce is fresh the dough was the best gf dough Ive had to date and the toppings were just divine  I need to put a GPS tracking unit on this truck so I can track it daily Oh waitI can just check their facebook page  Yeah Id eat it daily  Its that good"
1,Horrible service Twice now Ive gone there and they keep messing up my drink I work for Starbucks Its not hard to get a drink right Believe me Horrible service The people that work there All have bad attitude One lady doesnt even look at you when your ordering your drink I think that someone needs to go In there and fix it and make it a welcoming Starbucks that its known for Ya a few of the employees that work there are absolutely wonderful but when you get that one that is just rude it just makes you not want to go there anymore I stopped going They still get my drink wrong when my mom goes to get coffee Horrible
5,"Im currently staying at Camelback Inn for 3 days A pleasant treat after a molar extraction last Friday afternoon Although Ive sworn not to be seen in public with a swollen face I am truly enjoying this trip Theres a trail just behind this resort and a completely awesome view of the hills Awesome and I mean it
My hubby is out on his meetings and Im juggling my work the luxury of running your own biz take it anywhere you want do it anytime you want well not most of the time  
Just had lunch at Hoppins Jack Excellent service friendly staff especially the  handsome young german  Anyway ordered chicken sandwich with cashews and mandarin orange delish My lil girl was pacified with a vanilla sundae with fruity swirl raspberry or is it strawberries with peaches and berries I had a few spoonful yummy
Kids menu was dirt cheap fries and 3 pieces of chicken strips or rather crispy chunks  was actully tasty
I still have until tomorrow Maybe if I have time Ill head down to the spa for a desert rain loofah Oh as for the room great decor quite spacious and an outdoor porch with umbrella and seat to lounge around in the sun
Simply love the view It takes me away from everything Im in heavenly desertHighly recommended"
5,"This is the location I frequent most it helps it is less than a mile from my home 

I have been to a US Egg this and other locations more than a dozen times or two since moving to AZ in 2010 I love breakfast food and the specialty won me over instantly PROTEIN PANCAKES As the timeless Tina Turner once said Simply the Best That describes these pancakes perfectly 

Before I go on and on about the pancakes because I have been known to do so some background information about atmosphere staff etc 

This location is in a nondescript one story building in front of the offices at Mill Towne Center or is it Mill Town Centre Nothing fancy but I dont need a Jacket Required sort of feel to a place to enjoy my breakfast 

The staff is fantastic hostshostesses waitresses busboys I have never had anyone employed here be anything but 100 professional and attentive To speak to something others have mentioned about getting the check early while they are still eating as long as you continue to be my waitress ie refills requests for jelly etc I dont care if you bring the bill with the food If I decide I want something else I doubt any of the folks here would have a problem reprinting a corrected bill Now on to the food 

The protein pancakes are filled with blueberries granola cinnamon and silvered almonds The ingredients arent something exotic but they are perfectly balanced in the mix not too much or too little of any of them The thing about any food item you like at a restaurant it becomes a favorite because they are able to duplicate it time after time I have had this item many times more than any other item and they are always spot on knock on wood  

All the other dishes I have had always breakfast havent tried lunch yet were some combination of eggs and protein and the eggs are always perfectly cooked to my specification over medium and the meat always juicy 

I promise to write another review as soon as I dont get the protein pancakes which will be when they decide to remove them from the menu  NEVER  Oh or if I actually go in later than normal and feel like lunch over breakfast not good odds O"
5,Mesa Amphitheatre is easily my favorite concert venue in the Phoenix area  You can see and hear from anywhere in the place and the grassy risers were such a good idea  The sound was excellent for the two shows Ive been to there  Really just an overall nice peaceful place to see a show and enjoy the Arizona weather  Parking isnt too bad and neither are the lines to get in where they check your bags  To top it all of getting out of there was a breeze both times I was there
5,Kaley helped me get the best room in Mesa AZ my view was awesome The beds were clean and the service was awesome with a great cafe style restaurant I am recommending to all my friends to call Kaley for a hook up
5,"Waffle Houses are bomb but this one is my favorite  Not only is it 24 hours but it is super clean and well lit  There are totally some seedy people who go here but their conversations just make for very interesting background noise  

As far as the food the prices are cheap the menu is semialacarte and the the waffles are amazingly crisp and perfect  This is THE Waffle House to visit  Go now do it  How good does a waffle sound right now anyways  Thats right Pretty Damn Good"
5,Brie and Apple with Fig bruschettaI dont need to say anything else  except 5 glasses of wine til 5 all week and 5 mimosas til 5 on the weekends  Best place to spend a Sunday afternoon
5,"Now worthy of 5 stars for replacing their toilet with one that actually flushes Its always nice when a place that sells diuretic beverages has a working toilet



The baked goods are baked right there in the coffee house by their employees  The coffee is roasted right there on site Iced tea refills are free bitches The baristas are hep cats who ride fixie bikes Now I like to coast but shit  Gotta give them cred If you go often enough the other regulars will be friendly If you hate Mac laptops you probably should stay away The new tables are great There are power outlets everywhere Its next to Pane Bianco I run into my homies there on the regular When it comes to coffee shops in CenPho there is no competitor Jeff the owner is a cool dude The seating outside is nice I have been known to spend all day there and use it as my office away from home and my real office I seriously probably spend about 16 hours a week there or so maybe more some weeks working on my laptop and occasionally people watching Did I mention that I kind of like this place"
5,This is such a beautiful stadium to go to and relax at everything is so close that it only take 1015 mins to get where you want to be and on top of that there is westgate shopping center that is right there with all the bars and night clubs to go to after the games I recommend UOPX Stadium over any other in the valley because its clean and any seat in the house is a great onePlus the weather is always great
1,"This address is for the one next to Panda Express not the one in Walmart

This place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food Its like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make 

The dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down They should fire the manager and everyone that works there They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there 

I will NOT be returning to this place"
5,I took the pole dance aerobics class last night and man am i feeling it today everyone there was really welcoming and had great advice for me as ive never tried this kind of thing before its tucked away and at first i had no clue where it was but its worth the search had a blast got a great work out and felt great afterwards im definitely going back for more
5,"Hands down the best spa I have visited in the state and perhaps the nation 

Massages were amazing

Drinks and brunch were amazing

Staff went out of their way to take care of our every need

Went at 11 am to relax for the day and stayed until 5pm which is unheard of for me at a spa once the initial massage has taken place but this place kept me going all afternoon with the plunge pool sauna and steam Also the pool and spa hot tube outside were amazing I honestly cannot say enough about AJi and its wonderful staff

I will return"
5,Good food great atmosphere great service and great prices We will definitely be back Cant wait to try the Sunday Brunch
5,"I really REALLY like The Lodge so I was gonna give it 4 stars To be honest though I really cant think of any good reason NOT to give it that 5th star

Ive mostly been here for Happy Hour when visiting AZ but Ive also stopped in a few late nights and have always had a good time

The Lodge has one of the best Happy Hours deal wise in Old Town All apps except the mac  cheese and fried pickles are half off along w2 cheap drafts 3 Lodge signature drafts which is a tasty beer  3 wells stuck to beer on this last trip but if I recall in the past they actually use a heavy pour during happy hour

Ive tried quite a few of the apps and theyre all good The pretzels  cheese are particularly tasty I always get pretzels  cheese no matter where I am wthe friend I came here wfor happy hour the last time I was here so I can say Ive tried quite a few in my day  the Lodges ranks right up there

I admit Im a sucker for cheesy theme bars so I kind of of dig the ski lodge theme here the dining room area isnt huge but is clean wcomfy seats The bar area is pretty big  the patio is nice weather permitting 

Ive never had an issue wthe service here  both bartenders  bouncers are always nice"
5,"So going on vacation in a week and wanted to get a brazilian for the first time  I gotta say the technician Christine was great  She tells you what to expect and tosses in a little humor to keep you comfortable  It was very clean the wax isnt to hot and the technician never double dipped  I found the place very clean and comfortable  Pricing is just right too  I like that there are options to buy it for a year and go anywhere they have a shop

I did get told about product as others reviewed  However I didnt feel pushed because Christine explained how it can be used and why  In addition she told me of other uses for the product  

It was an all around good experience that I would recommend to any friend wanting to get waxed"
5,"My dentist recommended this place to me five years ago and every since then I keep a keen ear to any of her recommendations as Shimagamo is the best sushi Ive had anywhere  Ive had sushi in CA NY TX and HI   

The fish tastes fresh and the portions are generous  One piece of advice is to eat at the sushi bar rather than one of the booths assuming you are having sushi  In my experience sushi tastes better served as soon as each sushi piece prep is done rather than waiting for the entire sushi order to be completed  This place has the best Unagi and an awesome Escolar which I havent found anywhere else  The Suprise Crazy Roll served with a sweet wasabi sauce is always on our Sushi order

The only con is that this place is pricey but they do have a daily 57 happy hour that contains some great options  However the best stuff is usually not on the happy hour menu  Also this isnt a place to have Sake bombs  Its a very low key atmosphere for those just looking for an excellent meal  Youll likely notice early on how many folks are regulars  I was told this was the spot where many Japanese baseball players come to have their Sushi

The restaurant is very nondescript  It sits in a corner of a shopping mall and is easily overshadowed by its neighbor CFu Gourmet"
5,This hidden gem is located just outside of Mill Ave and is apparently the hipster home base of Tempe If somehow you are allowed in without suspenders or nonprescription clear glasses you will see exactly what goes on to the left at least four people playing chess to the right someone reading a book but sitting next to someone writing a book and did someone just walk in with a puppy Yes As you walk up to the counter you are already disoriented so you may be confused about what to order Well they are known for their cappuccinos which I can personally vouch for but on a hot summer day in Arizona I recommend their Dirty Horchata or Espresso Excellente a rice milk horchata with shots of espresso It was good for the minute it lasted See you there next time
5,"Mmm  Delicious Indian food and a great selection of vegetarian dishes

I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose  Im a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didnt have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy

I had a bowl of brown rice cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurtcucumbermint sauce on the side  It was fantastic  I cant wait to go back

also I thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for making the drive to their location and to compensate for highgas prices  A memorable gesture"
5,"Many have started out with this and it should be stressed  this wonderful place is TINY 

Suggest you make a reservation so you get he chance to enjoy the wonderful food that is in store We started with the stuffed mushrooms  like many others raved about and the Portuguese style mussels Both were fantastic and left us wanting to come back to try the other mussel offerings and appys as well The endless bread was the perfect tool for soaking up the rich juices the mussels were bathed in  

Were were pretty full but thought we would take a run at the Espana pizza Hands down the best pizza we have ever had The flavor could not be any better and the perfectly created thin crust let you enjoy the toppings as both a compliment and as a way to get it easily into your mouth 

Feels more like you have been invited to a friends house for an awesome meal as opposed to a restaurant Great people and they went to all lengths to make ours and the other patrons meal fantastic even the entirely needy hard to please and somewhat obnoxious woman seated near us

While I am sure they would make your super comfortable if you had to wait suggest you  make a reservation so you can enjoy this great little place"
5,This place never ceases to amaze One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix The Sicilian scramble is a favoritethough the smashed meatball was great We finally went back for dinner the other night and for the first time I had a burger It should not be surprising that is was fantastic Atmosphere is great service is great and the food is greatjust go
1,"Just a quick update  this KFC shut down just a few weeks ago 

There still might be someone in line tho"
5,I dont actually hunt or fish but after visiting this place Id like to take up those activities This place is like a giant outdoors amusement park Everything you could possibly want for outdoor activities is included in this store I could spend hours in this store just looking at everything they have available Plus now I know where to buy the furniture if I ever get a hunting lodge
5,Had lunch at Bliss again  still yummy as always This time I had the ceasar salad and their shoe string  parmesan cheese fries I still recommend this place for lunch or dinner
5,I admit it I eat donuts almost everyday and twice on Sundays Today a I found a new addiction french crullers uhhh they are soo good Melt in your mouth
5,"This is a great little hidden gem From the outside it looks like just a dive but the inside is surprisingly nice 

The food here is great and they are willing to make things to your taste when it comes to ingredients and spice level 

The waitstaff are also very friendly They came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an order at the counter place

Another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in Phoenix"
5,"This neighborhood sushi bar is one of the best in AZ Fresh fish good portions and great service A place where not every single roll is filled with imitation crab and drenched in sauce Majority of their sushi menu is pretty traditionalbut the sushi chefs takes special requests if you give them an idea of what you like I especially like the Cucumber Fiesta which is a salmonyellowtailtuna roll wrapped in cucumber instead rice

The staff is also very attentive They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars As I wait for a table I always see people greeted by name and received with hugs There must be a reason why people constantly come back right Check this place out and judge for yourself"
5,Amazing sushi Fast clean fresh Friendly staff Favorites are Arizona Beauty Alaska and Spicy Ninja although everything here is some of the best around hands down
5,"WOW A real European bakery  This was awesome after having lunch next door at La Buona Pasta we took home some kalachis and walnut roll home for later  The cakes are varied and everything looks buttery good and sweet  Having grown up near a Swedish bakery it kind of remind me of thatdonuts cakes cheesecakes breads and other European specialties  The shop is also set up with a small section of Polishcentric groceries  mmmm maybe I will have to learn to cook some Polish dishes  Next special occasion my cake is coming from there  

The one we visited is 
13331 W Indian School Rd
Litchfield Park AZ 85340 USA

5,"this place is awesome GO  soon  already decent wait times 

OH pitches of pbr for 7 bucks yeah yeah shut up

GO GO GO"
5,"I was so happy when I saw this chain appear in AZ  I used to frequent it in CA and have never found another sub that comes close  

I think the secret to their success lies in the freshness and quality of their meats and cheeses  always sliced to order  If you are looking for a veggie sandwich  you will be limited here  But if you like a hearty cheesesteak or italian sub you are in for a treat  They also take a bit of a different approach in that they really douse their sandwiches in oil  vinegar   It is a different approach but seriously good  The Mikes Way option lettuce onions  tomatoes is a bit bland I love to add the mustard mayo  pepperocini

Their signature sandwich is the 13  It has several flavorful italian meats plus freshly sliced cheese  Dont judge this place until you have tried that sandwich  It is unlike any other chains offering  really amazing  

Their sandwich sizes are a bit different from the regular footlong but if you order the largest size you are getting quite a bit for your money  Ive visited the one that just opened in Chandler and was completely pleased  And Im happy to hear they are now opening one in Ahwatukee

They also seem to have a high focus on customer service  Ive always been met by very cheerful helpful people  Not a necessity for a sandwich but certainly a lot better than the opposite"
1,I have literally never seen this place open and I live two blocks away
5,"This place was once known as J Chew and Company I loved that place and this new version is still great

So comfy so casual so welcoming and so nonscottsdaley its just the best"
5,"Im not a fan of chains I far prefer to find and give my business to new and interesting local fare That said there are a couple of chains I like and one is Texas Roadhouse

Texas Roadhouse does two things really well steak and portions I can go to a Texas Roadhouse anywhere and get a wellmade ribeye at a very reasonable price It made not be fork tender or the same quality as a 50 ribeye but itll only cost me 18 and I know it will be far superior to any other more expensive chain steakhouse But before I get that steak Ill get peanuts bread salad and sides So Ill likely have half a steak for lunch the next day

Like I said well made steak and portions Im good with that"
5,"I picked up a jar of freshmade salsa and chips for the Superbowl party I was attending last Sunday because they are that outstanding  They were a big hit  

If you are dining at the Blue Adobe definitely try the chips and salsa  I am not a big fan of chipotle seasoning it is definitely one of the key ingredients but regardless I think it tastes great  If you like it you can buy a jar of the fresh salsa and take it home with you for about 9 it is a good sized jar"
5,"This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area and the best

The food is very delicious and the owner Preet is very hospitable

Too bad I no longer live in Ahwatukee  All I could think of when I was at a restaurant down the street from my place earlier is how mouthwatering Star of Indias chicken tikka masala is Yumm

A must visit"
5,Great quality food atmosphere and location This is a place to take a date to or just to have an enjoyable evening with great food The meatloaf When they have it is amazing Steak is also top ofthe line Definitely recommend
5,"Whats all the fuss  Im not sure what folks compare this chain too The Dead Duck Inn  Joes local Chinese Gag house Are those places that great Sooo fresh and delicious Not in my days Premade sitting around and HEAVY oil is what I see from most other establishments Even those touted by friends Maybe its because they know George from behind the counter  Its not Pei Wei Pei Wei is a quick fresh and inexpensive gift from heaven Even the hard to please Yelper has to admit the multiple options you have to modify your meal should give you no excuse not to love what you order The food is fresh and prepared to order Even fried rice is made to order The sauces are made from scratch and are a combination of quality Chinese ingredients Chili paste fresh garlic scallions bean curd and a bounty of fresh Chinese vegetables  Go Yon China will serve you premade sauces with no punch and lots of giggle The atmosphere at Pei Wei is great Black and dark red with glossy graphics and all sorts of Chinese Even with the stand in line style of dining Makes me hungry just thinkin about the joint However to me its a take out Ferrari Call in swipe my card and off I go Sure its not Changs Still its better than the local Dead Duck Inns food stained art with a Chinese New Year paper place mat 

Of course Im looking at the healthier options a Chinese food place may have to offer and Pei Wei lifts the bar in multiple sets Get your chicken steamed go brown rice add extra vegetables or go vegetarian Still you may complainOh is it too salty Or too sweet Give me a break This is CHINESE FOOD And you wont find MSG So if you dont want spicy salty or sweet have a meal from Bland of the Rising Sun But if you want a highly under rated treatI ask you to open your mind to this familiar spot for clean fresh made to order and if you like healthy Chinese food"
1,"AMC Theaters has the distinct disadvantage in Phoenix at operating in a town with a highquality local provider of entertainment Harkins and they really pale in comparison Tonight we went to the AMC 24 at Arizona Center which is literally right near our house but weve been there only two or three times in as many years Why Because AMC doesnt offer a senior discount any longer

For AMC Management  Did you know that there is a huge population of older people living in condos in the downtown Phoenix location who go to moves three and four times a week I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I could go to a Harkins and see a movie for 1213 for two but when its an AMC Theater its 20 Do they think they are so special that they warrant this extra tax

The theater is generally clean and nice but the prices on sodas and popcorn are too high combined with the fact that they dont offer the discount to seniors AMC please just fold up your tent and go away We dont need you here"
1,"Bitzee Mamas isnt my mama My mama wouldnt have kept her hungry son waiting forever for his lunch She wouldnt have let my go thirsty with no refills She does make a good bowl of salsa so that makes it alright right 

Took my real mama there for lunch I ordered the taco salad and ma ordered the cheese enchilada plate also a bowl or red chile Taco salad was alright except the taco shell was so mushy from water it literally fell apart when I picked it up glad I wasnt eating the shell Shes old school makes a darn good cheese enchilada and refried beans Struck out again with the red chile I swear can no one except La Canasta make red chile While the meat was tender and the sauce was smooth it had a weird orange color to it and the meat tasted well wasnt any beef Ive ever had 

On the way to the counter to pay my bill I noticed that almost everyone was eating chimichangas well then looks like I ordered the wrong thing Place is also uber cheap 

Be careful what you order and mama will be just fine"
5,If you desire true Chicago deep dish pizza then Nellos should be at the top of your list This is a staple pizza location in the Valley and my family has been going for years Nellos offers a great menu drink list and atmosphere They offer an excellent MonFri lunch special  a large drink salad and 2topping personal pizza for 899 what a steal Dont pass this place up its worth it
5,My house has never been this clean EVER I am thrilled with the level of service and professionalism expressed by the women who cleaned my house today I bought a Living Social coupon and I am so glad I found this company 5 women arrived and fully cleaned my house in 45 minutes The women were friendly to me and especially my dog which is the sign of a wonderful company if you ask me I am hoping I am able to use this service on a monthly basis Angela scheduled my appointment immediately when I let her know I had company coming in town and the cleaners arrived during the scheduled time I am thrilled with the results
5,The Flower Studio far exceeded my expectations at my wedding Christine is an amazing artist businesswoman and person She made time to meet with me outside her regular hours and really understood my vision for my wedding Her arrangements for my wedding were absolutely stunning and really took the event to the next level I am more than thrilled with this company and would recommend them to anyone Thank you Flower Studio for making my wedding so beautiful
5,I dig the breakfast been to 7th and 38th and had Nans breakfast Plus have had tamales too so really is something to come back In 13years I live in Cali been here 26 times and not fancy although 7th is the one with great pottery and colors inside I ate 1 time for lunch of dinner and 25 times for brekafast
5,Hybrid class Did it a few years back and to this day its the best workout Ive ever had Will be going back FOR SURE
5,Super cool coffee bar with a great outdoor patio for little ones to run around
5,Ive been here three times and have had terrific food each time  The meat is incredible and their sauces are amazing  Portion sizes are generous and the mac  cheese is delicious  This is what BBQ is all about definitely one of the best in Phoenix and were lucky to have it here in the NW valley
1,Closed GONE UNDER OUTTA HERE See ya later bye bye
5,"I have been going to Vatoci hair salon for over a year now Ive had the same stylist from day one and I highly recommend her Ive never had so many compliments on my hair Ask for Marsha Mirushe and I guarantee shell take amazing care of you 

I love that she always remembers what we talk about and asks me about my job and my kids too I am sure that Spiro and Vera also do a great job because the people who are in there when I am are regulars and everyone is always happy to be there 

My daughter loved going in to be pampered as well and they are amazingly flexible on scheduling appointments even though they always seem to have plenty of customers They know what they are doing Highly recommend"
1,"It was family day the ex and I like to see our son smile and we were starving after driving around for a while we pulled up to Arribas and said what the hell

Thats also what we said when some of the food came as in what the hell is this

So positive first  The server was pretty quick and he gave refills without being asked  Chips and salsa were good  Chips were warm and salsa had a nice suprising kick  Kick do I sound like an old lady 

Morgan and I ordered fish tacos and beef tacos respectively so we could swap one for one  Fish was ok nothing spectacular but honestly I would rather pay for one at freakin Del Taco or Rubios  Not worth it here  Rice was ok some flavor probably converted rice though  Beans were blended  I dunno about you but I like to see some actual BEANS in my beans  This stuff was like brown goo YUMMMMMMMM P

The beef taco was just weird  I swear to God is tasted like gyro meat  WTF  I couldnt eat much of it  

Last but not least Dom ordered the White Sands Chimichanga  That sht looked nasty to be honest  Covered with some gooey white sauce filled with pork  LOL he said it tasted like hot dog  Um yikes  He took about 2 bites and was full  AKA he didnt like it

I also had a margarita it was HUGE and didnt taste very good  Id rather have one 14 that size that tasted nice  Oh well

One star for the chips and salsa  Like I said the fish taco was okay but every thing was just way overpriced  

Final verdict  We decided to NEVER go there again"
5,Kona grill is never a disappointment  Sushi the regular menu the atmosphere  The staff is very friendly and the food is very good  We like to create our own sushi dishes and the chef is always ready and willing  I highly recommend Kona Grill for consistently good food
5,"I love this place I want to go to Arizona just to eat here  The greek fries were really good and different  It was just really really good 

Were going next time Im in town Fervor"
5,"If you buy half a duck you dont get to pick which duck

I lived in China mainly Guangdong for three years and all it really took was a look at this sign along of course with all the wonderful roasted ducks and pork to know I had come across a place with bona fides 

Hope Kee has some of the very best Chinese food in town in my opinion and is worth the trip from wherever it is in the valley that you live 

I dont know anywhere else in town you can get such good congee which is actually called zhou or jook and which is a soupy delicious rice porridge  

Theyre also one of the only places you can get dried scallop soup which they do an excellent job of 

Dried scallops a specialty of HKGuangdong are one of the most delicious things in the world 

Everything that they make is delicious and sitting in there listening to the customers and staff talk in Chinese and Cantonese can really take you back to China if youve had the pleasure of spending time there Otherwise its just about as close as you can get 

If you want to eat some real Chinese food that is both delicious and approachable and very reasonably priced you cant beat Hope Kee 

Get some soup or some congee some clams with black bean sauce some greens and some BBQ and youll see why China and Hope Kee are such hard places to stay away from 

If you do decide to try your hand at duckpicking and buy a whole duck fear not for wasted leftovers because roasted duck makes for a very tasty soup"
5,How can something so simple taste sooo good I wish there were one more on the west side I hate going to the fair to get my fix of fry bread There needs to be one of these on every  corner of the compass in Phoenix As Rachel Ray would say Yummy
1,This was the most HORRIBLE floor cleaning I have ever seen We took before and after pictures and cannot tell the difference at all The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone We paid 1000 and got 20 worth of service I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the staining as he would say off easily I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaningcan you read the saying That is exctaly how we felt after the service REALLY
5,This is my first time trying this place and I had a wonderful experience The place was packed and yet they got me in right away A young man gave me a pedicure and did a spectacular job They even put on a timer for 15 mins to ensure I got a full massage during it They offered the other services but did not force any on me I will definitely use them again and recommend the place to others
5,The best staff around Very friendly and always make sure you are satisfied with your food The food is great as well From breakfast to lunch and healthy shakes like Fast Fuel you can get it here Very clean too
5,"Im a sucker for great libations and the stores that can carry the works Zinfandel for me Magners for my boy  a great Irish cider we fell in love with in SF
great tequilas all types of wines you get my sniffster"
5,Wow The Penang Curry chicken was absolutely incredible The portion was hugehad enough left over for another meal and tasted just as good the 2nd day I will definitely be back The Thai Tea was very good also I just wish it was closer to Gilbert
1,Donuts are really good if they have any when you get there  Went in on a Tuesday morning at 1030 and they only had a total of 10 donuts Drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at Dunkin Donuts Very disappointed
5,"Im a huge fan of Padres What food Ive tried I mainly just order tacos or their pork sliders usually is delicious the bartenders are awesome and the owners are always friendly

One of my favorite things to do Order two tacos and half a bowl of guacamole with chips and salsa"
5,This place is absolutely wonderful My boyfriend and I have been here for a few special occasions and have never been dissappointed the food is amazing and the service is just as good our waiter was so unbelievably nice Their steak could possibly be the best steak I have ever eaten and their creme brulee is to die for This place even does complimentary filet mignon sandwiches for happy hourguarantee you will love this place just as much as we do
5,"I am a Regus member and could get wait here since I could use my membership card
Its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view 
Complimentary menu is refreshing Cordial staff Quiet and relaxed environment
Many TV screens and seatings to get comfortable with"
5,"its HOTin the valley in the summer time and QT lives up to its name 
ONE STOP DRINK SHOP 
HEAVEN in the summer time and the price is unbeatable"
5,"As a frequent antiques consumer I can honestly say that Lizabels Treasures is my favorite antique store in Phoenix Ive been a customer for several years and Lizabels is my first and often only stop

Why Lizabels is such a treasure is because of these things price desirable antiques and great customer service John and Bette know what people want and they go to great lengths to get the antiques that people want and to make their customers happy Im a believer

They consistently have oneofakind quality furniture and pieces that you would not normally find elsewhere in town Pieces are priced very agreeably so you can afford to stock up or furnish a whole room without busting the bank

John and Bette have created the kind of family business that is to be admired They have a legion of supportive customers and Im one of them I can always find them to be helpful and interested in getting me what I want even if I dont always know what I want

Lisabels Treasures is the place to build a relationship with because as ones lifes needs changes so does the need for different pieces and furniture I can always count on finding something I really love at their store and you will too"
5,"In a sentance Four Peaks is DEFINATLY something to write Yelp about From the moment I realized that there were more reviews about this place than Id care to read in one sitting I knew this was going to be good I realized it was going to be fantastic when i pulled up with my friend Darius and we had a hard time finding a parking spot at 3pm We met a friend for lunch and the place was laid back chill clean cozy and yet modern  perfect 

I had the French Dip thinly sliced roast beef on a nice hogie bun Everything was good not too salty not too greasy loved it Darius got the Fish N Chips and it was incredible Crispy batter dipped big pieces of fish iot was crispy and crunchy but soft and delightful on the inside The chips were also batter dipped and had great flavor I was in love this is my best recommendation for a meal at Four Peaks

To my yelpers i say there is limited parking so when you pull up and see nothing but cars lining the street do NOT be alarmed there will be a table available Another thing get the fish n chips Its duhvine"
1,"I was so looking forward to breakfast here What a disappointment

The food is the only thing that rates any stars at all Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service

The space is nice but crowded and loud The counter staff were indifferent After being waved over to an open register the fellow behind the counter took one order then wandered off leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order

You are given a number or not and left to find your own table scrounge up your own silverware and wait for your food to be delivered Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver they were out of forks and most of the tables were completely filthy I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off

Beverages are apparently serve yourself although they didnt bother to say that when I ordered I stood at the counter waiting for iced tea only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself

If they happen to run out of numbers then they input your name with your order Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant Better yet the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers Lisa Is there a Lisa here while your food cools Inexcusable

The only bright point the croque madame was tasty Delicious bread ham and a perfectly fried egg But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming However the side of fruit made me angry a tiny metal creamer with 1 blackberry a few slices of strawberry and 2 chunks of  green apple Insulting

Fast casual order at the counter works well when tables are clean and set and the food delivery is speedy and efficient Unfortunately this place needs some work in order to make it worth your time"
1,May have great food but Ill never know Ordered delivery and the chef who doesnt speak English couldnt find my apartment complex even when I walked out to the street right next to the 101 far away He said he was there but couldnt tell me where he was Talked to him on the phone for ten minutes then hung up on me when I guess he got frustrated and wouldnt answer my calls back Called to order food for my visiting family and was glad to find this place but that chef is awful The owner apologized to me profusely and that was a nice gesture but waiting an hour for a guy who hangs up on you and cant find a place looking at the 101 exit is ridiculous Dont use them for delivery ever call the Breakfast Joynt Their owner is awesome and delivers to you himself Plus he actually knows the area Cannot express my frustration with this restaurants service Do not use EVER
5,"This is my kind of restaurant I love everything about Buca di Beppo

I am fascinated by how this place was decorated All the walls and various trinkets make this a fun dining experience 

One thing to note is that it can be kind of expensive to eat here although I am always finding coupons for this restaurant so that helps

Beyond that the food is awesome I go with my fiance and we love the calamari and the garlic bread which we always get as appetizers We switch up the main course when we go but each time has had great results We had dessert here once too and that was also good We usually end up with leftovers because they give huge portions which we love I cant wait to come again"
5,"I hate ordering flowers sight unseen but needed a local florist for a sympathy arrangement Rachel immediately alleviated any concern when we discussed what I wanted in detail and she even emailed me a photo of the final arrangement 
Gorgeous flowers same day delivery and reasonable pricing  cant beat that"
5,Well I cannot believe I have waited this long to give an update on Morgan  Especially since she is FANTASTIC  Yes I have been back to her for the 5th time now and I love what she suggested I do to the color on my hair much better than what I was doing and her haircuts are the best  She also has done some other treatments on my hair that have made it hold up under this hard dry AZ weather  And she is so sweet and caring  Oh she has also gone out of her way to make an introduction to another of her clients also from the South who was new here and had not met many people and we really hit it off  Morgan knew we would  I mean what more can you ask forgo for itYOU WILL NOT BE SORRY   This from a HAPPY HAPPY Client Christine
5,Beautiful parish also home to the amazing Legacy Ballroom that is available for wedding receptions and events  The annual Middle East food festival is a wonderful family event with fantastic food pastry and entertainment
5,Pancit palabok here is best outside of the Philippines Anyone can enjoy a quiet peaceful dinner on a Friday night
5,My food was delicious and the waitress were nice They didnt bother me every 5 minutes and I was able to enjoy my meal Spicy does mean spicy here though
5,Amazing facility Scottsdale healthcare has done a great job the people are happy to work here unlike some hospitals They are very receptive and the ER operates like clockwork
5,"Amazing

This is often called the largest mall in Arizona and it shows Each time Ive done the usual mall walk Ive easily lost a few hours trying to see it all Its true that this isnt a place for anyone that doesnt care about fashion  but this is a mall thats true to its name Fashion Center is no joke here Lots of highend designer stores lots of midrange affordable fashion stores and a few random familiar stops like Hallmark and Pottery Barnesque stores scattered through there A decent food court with a theater also conveniently down there But after spending so many hours at the mall who has time for a movie

You can easily drop a few thousand here so be forewarned if youre on a budget Also I almost wish I had a map in my pocket because it can get confusing to remember which hallways youve already explored And wear some comfortable walking shoes because its not easy to get in and get out of this one But theres a good number of parking to use in a garage or few  when you remember where you parked the car 

Id take any outoftowner here unless they had a grudge against fashion classy stores or walking"
5,"This go around I opted for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito served all day and lengua tongue cabeza head and cheek meat and carnitas roasted pork tacos  

The breakfast burrito was the tastiest bacon filled treat I have ever had I love bacon and if you dont love it as much as I do the bacon overload may be too much I swear there might be more bacon than egg in this bacon bomb

I should have figured that with a price of 250 per taco they would be slightly bigger than the average taqueria taco  The size of these things are gAstronomical and the flavor of each are equally proportional the lengua however  wouldve probably been better if it hadnt been sitting in the cold whilst I ate the other three items

I will no longer be eating carne asada at this place when I have the option of carnitas cabeza lengua or bacon  I advise you to do the same"
1,I eat a lot of Asian food of different sorts  Asian is actually my goto cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies  This place deserves a thumbsdown unless you love Americanized Asian  The food was bland breaded and just not worth any money  Next time Im in Phoenix I definitely wont eat here
5,"Followed a Dr that I respect to this practice and I have to say Im pretty impressed As a long time multifourfooted caregiver I have seen more than my share of veterinary clinics and animal hospitals I know the drill and have seen more than one vacation be sucked in to the great black hole of well of course I want  to have the best care 

The first thing I noticed is that there is NO odor It doesnt smell like there have been decades of animals paraded through the doors that feel the need to pee as soon as they enter the room just in case this is their one last shot at leaving something behind 

Then there is the overall feel of the place The office I used to frequent always had a frenetic sort of feel to it Files were lost techs were running the waiting room was packed with stressed out clients etc This office was peaceful Whether is natural or contrived I could care less My dog picked up on it immediately and her normal OMG what are we doing HERE behavior was replaced with something Ive never witnessed in a vet office before She was calm 

Its clean Except for the area around me that was covered in the undercoat that Zoe was stress releasing there were no traces of other animals 

The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful I had a HUGE file that I was bringing in and they patiently sorted through the entire thing While I was there for one of my pets the receptionist offered to set all of them in my household up for me with Client Files so that I wouldnt have to be bothered in the future I thought that was a wonderful timesaving offer and in the event that I ever have to go with an emergency and am not able to focus on paperwork 

Finally I was in an examination room at the time of my appointment and waited less than 3 minutes for both the tech and the Dr I was in an out under 1 hour and that my friends is superior service IMHO 

I look forward to a long relationship with Palm Glen and will happily drive the 5 mile difference from my old vet in order to ensure both my pets and I are treated well"
5,This place is pretty incredible  The california club and the breakfast buzz are probably the best items on the menu IMO but seriously you cant go wrong  The only thing Ive had that I didnt really care for is the Breakfast Burrito but that was because it was just a little boring compared to the other choices on their menu  Its a long wait in the drive thru 99 of the time but it is absolutley MORE than worth it
1,"Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside this nice red cadillac out front nice patio outside and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side Upon entering it was pretty dead well it was a Monday afternoon after all

I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad I dove into the mashed potatos which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste garlic cheese horshradish etc I picked garlic  always go safe at a first time resturaunt The gravy was very bland I ended up putting more salt on it The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate They had also put diced garlic in the mix not roasted but raw garlic I love garlic but I cant eat whole cloves horrible headaches like some of those awesome people can out there so it was kinda a downer there The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy cook and serve

Since I came with friends and family it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes My mother ordered the Fish and Chips they were slightly on the dark side the fish wasnt fishy but slightly bland the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol The fries were really good though My friend had ordered the same thing I think she wasnt complaining was because she had ordered mamosas lol

Servicewise it was slow but dont expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday

I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie but that single dish alone wont help this review get to two stars

All in all eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you cant get in to another popular resturaunt at the time"
5,Love this place  Went for a staycation with the girls for a spa day and stayed the night  I cant wait to go back  You are in the city but feels miles away  The spa is amazing  Wonderful adults only pool with great refreshing food and drinks  Then our rooms were clean and comfortable  Dinner at Kai was nothing short of superb and breakfast the next morning on the patio over looking the golf course and pool area was also very good  Overall a wonderful night away
5,"This is my favorite place to go for Greek food The owners are from Greece and frequently several family members are present

The food is delicious large portions friendly service I wish they were located in Surprise but they are worth the drive"
5,I have been here multiple times and each time the staff has been superb  Their selection is also awesome  I would highly recommend
5,Huge store friendly staff
5,My car looks better than it did the day I bought it
5,OMG this place is good Great Italian beef Great burgers FRY SAUCE I dont know how theyre pulling off such good food with what they have but its awesome and I will be eating here if Im in the area and hungry
5,I love my eye doctor  Platonically of course  The entire staff is relaxed friendly easy going and personable  No one ever makes you feel rushed but instead take time to make sure that everything is okay that youve thought of everything gotten all of your questions answered and had plenty of time to make decisions and think  The doctor takes time to get to know you and to talk about how you use your eyes staring at the computer sports etc  The assistants try to think of things from your point of view so they can volunteer useful information and ask a lot of specific questions while doing so  This place treats you like family  Theres a broad range of styles but mostly theyre fashionable frames  When I go in I see a lot of kids young adults and 20 and 30somethings as well as the older patients who so often come to need glasses  Horwitz costs a little more than the mall chains but my prescriptions have been consistently better thanks to the doctor taking time the lenses are much higher quality and the frames are worlds better in terms of availability of things that arent ugly and durability
1,"Treated with complete disrespect Worst service I have ever experienced  After waiting to see the manager I was directed to an employee who committed slander towards me very loudly in front of everyone in the store Then the manager stepped in spoke robotically without listening and then was incredibly harsh in tone and told me to leave He said leave get out now 
Dont go to this storedont use verizon"
5,Always treat me well very honest
5,"One of my top choices for downtown Phoenix Always an upscale posh vibe but with very generous prices on entrees Good looking people throughout this bar 

The Kisras are VERY tasty and a good spin off the typical flatbreads at many restaurants now 

Brunch here on Saturdays or Sundays great drink specials too"
5,Great atmosphere and food We keep coming back
5,Most amazing service The food is common pho and buns but the main attraction is what drew me in its not your typical Vietnamese restaurant its a SPRING ROLL BAR Fantastic drinks Great addition
5,"Ahhh Four Peaks  By far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix  This place is fantastic as far as brew pubs go  great beer and great food to go with it  I cant believe I havent taken the time to review it yet

The Beer pretty consistently awesome  All the beers are at least good my favorites being 8th Street Ale and their IPAs Hop Knot and Raj  I have to say the Kiltlifter is a tad overrated but still pretty solid and worth a try  Ive been meaning to try one of their cask conditioned ales but they always seem to be out probably indicative of the quality of those selections

The Food fantastic  I cant say that Ive ever had a bad meal at Four Peaks  The Italian Beef Beer Bread is the best thing on the menu but you cant go wrong with the Chicken Fingers Chicken Salad Pita or really any of their sandwiches  The fries are also great here  theres a little crispy coating on the outside that is quite tasty  Oh and the Spicy Thai Hummus is also a really good appetizer  A little more liquidy than your average hummus but really good  It has a nice little kick to it that will have you reaching for your beer

Bottom line if you live in Phoenix like beer and enjoy eating a good meal then you should be shot if you dont like Four Peaks  If you havent been yet do yourself a favor and try it  Youll come away happy I promise"
5,"Ive been going here many years

The food is always very very good Soups are fantastic sandwiches are hearty and flavorful and the service is excellent Prices are reasonable and the food quality and quantity is probably the best bang for the  youll get in a place like this anywhere Ive been  and I travel a lot

I really cannot think of a single thing I can fault this place for"
5,omg I love this place the food is great the selection is great the staff is very helpful This  is a great place to go have a few drinks and great stir fry
5,I love this place  The family is very sweet and the food is real deal homecooked Cuban food  as good as I remember eating in Havana  I love the Fricase de Pollo and my hubby loves the oxtail  The fruit juicessmoothies are delish too
5,"What to choose what to choose Such difficult decisions Seriously this normally isnt a problem Dispite the fact that Im a libra Im very decisive Friends usually look to me to make all sorts of decisions diabolical laugh Still this place consistently stumps me

Is it Tuesday If yes then Im definately getting the Pork Belly Tacos

Otherwise Ill start with an order of Ceviche and Asado Salad

To drink Ill have Agua Fresca de Sabor

Yes Im going to have an entre too I mean Ive already broken my diet might as well D

Ill have the Huevos Rancheros or 3 Carne Asada Tacos or the Verduras de Temporada or the Chilaquiles Verdes or the Carne Asada Torta OMG so many great options Seriously this normally isnt a problem Oh well I guess Ill just have to try everything

Next up a euphoric food coma Life is good"
1,"After reading all the good reviews we were looking forward to eating here but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell Bummerthe smell just killed it for us right from the get go Immediately upon walking in the door the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a tonofbricks We did a 180 and walked right out No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk 

Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot Tasty Thai"
5,"my husband and i LOVE this place 

no we cannot afford to get our weekly groceries here although it would be terrific if we could but we view oakville as an excellent alternative to dining out on the weekend 

the food is delicious think deli simplicity quality ingredients and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing we found that if its too crowded inside then its easy enough go outside to the awesome patio area to enjoy our beer and goodies "
1,HORRIBLEno NONEXISTENT customer service  Which is a shame considering they have good pizza  I ordered 2 pizzas wings a 2 liter and extra ranch an hour later the delivery guy showed up with 1 pizza and wings  When I told him that the order was not complete he just rolled his eyes and rudely informed me their online ordering was messed up  Then shoved the pizza and wings at me without apologizing or offering to correct the mistake  Problem was I had already been charged for the whole order so I was not about to take less than half of what I paid for  I told him to cancel the order and he turned and stomped away without another word  I immediately called the store to make sure I would be credited for my screwed up order that the delivery guy made no attempt to correct  I asked for the manager when they answered  The girl who answered said to someone in the background without putting me on hold so I heard every word Someone wants a manager  I guess that is you  The  manager told her he didnt have time to talk to customers and proceeded to yell at her about all the work he had to douh FYI buddy customers are THE REASON YOU ARE IN BUSINESS so it would be a good idea to make time for them The poor girl came back to the phone after being totally berated by the manager and I told her what had happened with my order She offered to credit my card for the order  Only problem is it takes 48 hours to process  So now I am out 40 for the next few days I have waited over an hour and still have no dinner and I was treated horribly by not one delivery driver but two manager Mama Mia employees  I told the girl on the phone that the delivery guy and manager should not treat customers so rudely she apologetically agreed  I asked for the contact information of the owner if this were my business I would want someone to let me know if my employees were treating customers like dirt  She could not provide the contact information but offered to call someone named Frank and have him call me back to resolve the situation  I never received a call  Apparently the customers are not important tone is set at the top in this business  There are lots of good pizza places in Phoenix save yourself the hassle and the headache order from somewhere that actually knows the meaning of customer service
5,"I just ordered the hamburger then added my favorite toppings

Another excellent burger I have to say Plenty of meat freshly made  and hot off the grill

Top notch fries as well overflowing from the cup they put it in  It takes about 5  10 minutes to get a great fresh burger like this  but is very much worth the wait"
1,"A friend was visiting from out of town and we decided we wanted a pampering experience  So rather than go to my neighborhood manipedi place we went over to old town scottsdale for lunch and a we hoped luxurious pedicure  This place looked very promising and the lady at the front really talked them up so we took the plunge  

Everything seemed promising    we waited in a lovely outdoor area until they were ready for us  Then    disappointment  The pedicure was nothing I couldnt get for half the price the massage chairs just vibrated my feet were still a little rough afterward and the paint job wasnt even that good  

Basically this was VERY overpriced for what was an incredibly unexceptional pedicure  We still enjoyed ourselves but agreed we would never go back there"
5,"I went for both breakfast  dinner two days in a row I got the commuter sandwich which was fabulous  didnt think such simple ingredients could blow my mind I came back for dinner and got the kale  quiona salad  again  very simple but amazing

I need to come back and get the pizza"
5,Simply the best automotive repair place Ive yet found in Phoenix Honest fair and competent Ive taken three vehicles there for service over several years now and never been dissatisfied
5,2nd time I went to Grazie and both times it was excellent The service is fast and attentive and the food great The portions are huge so there is no problem to share the starter or the thin crust woodfired pizza  So far I had the Dame Edna and the Roma pizza and both were very tasty The wine collection is great and has some very interesting stuff which includes also less expensive wines Havent made it to the desert menu yet as both times there was no space left

1,Went there first thing thing this morning Ordered 2 simple sandwiches Took over 35 minutes to make 6 workers lounging around Completely ignored Totally disgusted with their service Overpriced Food okay and felt worthless when I left
5,I have been going here for years I love the Hong Kong style pan fried crispy noodles
5,"Ive been a patient of Dr Lienaus since I was six years old  I usually dont care who my primary care physician is but when it comes to my dentist theres no way in heck I would switch  I even referred a coworker to him recently  

Hes very honest upfront and has such a great support staff  Colleen is the NICEST receptionist  One of the hygienists has been there for years I forgot her name and is also a very friendly woman

I definitely recommend Dr Lienau"
5,dr matsumoto and her team are the best  she came recommended to me by a friend who also goes there  they truly care about the WHOLE child and not just their medical care  we have seen 3 of the pediatricians in the office and they have all been great  we developed a special bond with Dr Miller during a very lengthy health issue with my son  its a 45 minute drive for us now that weve moved but we still make the drive  to see dr  miller because we  trust her to make the right decisions and offer the best advice for my childs health
5,my first time here at blue 32 was great i came for happy hour I had the chicken wings and a chambord margarita both are fantastic service was friendly and fast
5,Best selection of raw and dehydrated food around  Very helpful personnel friendly  Will shop here each time I vacation here with my dog
5,Well take this over Godiva any day   The staff is always so friendly and theyre always nice enough to give my kids all 4 a sample too    Nothing compares to their chocolates especially the the vanilla milk chocolate Brown Sugar Milk Chocolate and Coconut Milk Chocolate  Dont forget the lollipops that last FOREVER for the kids  Just make sure you have a few wipes on hand
5,"Its a restaurant in a gas station but it merits five stars bc it has glass bottles of soda just like you find in Mexico  Good food too  Its actually not nearly as bad inside as youd think its pretty well set apart from the gas station sales so I wouldnt mind eating there  They have a few tables set up inside  I usually get takeout though they also deliver  

MANZANA LIFT ROCKS  Im also going to be drinking the Sprite in the bottle cane sugar ftw and the horchata  I dont care about Chipotle opening near work anymore Ive found a new Mexican fix for lunch  What a happy day"
5,I used to work here back when it was a Harkins  Its way better now  Comfortable friendly laidback  Kind of decorated in a golden age of hollywood style  I dig it
5,I stumbled across this restaurant several years ago after becoming frustrated with the generally 2 hour wait no matter what day at a DIFFERENT pizza restaurant in Heritage square downtown Phoenix  Although the pizza was terrific at that other restaurant in Heritage square I had a pretty UNBELIEVABLE experienceI was with a date we waited the 2 hours had a really good dinner salad an appetizer and pizza  We decided we wanted another pizza and when we asked our server for another we were told that we could not because there was a line of people waiting to get in  I was amazed  We left knowing we would NEVER go back  I heard about La Piazza al Forno not long after that experienceI truly believe things happen for a reason  The pizza was even better and has been consistant ever since  The service was very warm and friendly literally like a family welcoming me into their home  I learned that night that it was one big family run business  Oh and by the way the bestdid I say BEST pizza that I not only have had in AZ but NY has nothing over them  Icing on the cake the prices are VERY reasonable I GOTTA have a fix every 10 days For the longest time I didnt want to tell anyone about my secret however they DESERVE to be known  AWESOME
5,"Wow  This place is amazing  So amazing I went there twice in a week  I will start with my dinner

The ambiance was great  The place has a nice warm feeling to it and since it was cold outside it was really nice  They had a large fireplace inside and after dinner we stayed for the great crowd that showed up and went outside  It was pretty chilly but I didnt even notice as the fire pit was big enough to warm everyone around it  They also had ample heat lamps  

The food was fantastic  I had the tomato soup with the grilled cheese crouton in it and it warmed me up and prepped me for my main meal  I had the burger and tender belly bacon  This was an amazing treat for my taste buds  The bacon was not like any bacon I have had on a burger  It was a perfect complement for each other  I wanted another one when I was done but couldnt possibly eat anymore 

The drinks were great  They have an amazing wine selection  The wines we were drinking were affordable and it looks like they really spent some time picking the right wines to carry  They have some really nice wines that rival the selection of some of the really nice wine bars in Scottsdale as well  My friends said that the mixed drinks were really well made and they were very happy with how they turned out  They have just about everything you could want for mixed drinks

Service was amazing as well  They were really attentive and the owner stopped by to talk to our table  

Lunch

The lunch was just as good as the dinner  I had a shrimp BLT that rivals anything in AZ  I was glad to see that had a variety of Dr PepperMr Pibb on tap  It was really relaxing to sit there at lunch and enjoy the crowd  The service was excellent

Overall I highly recommend Vintage 95 for lunch or dinner  It is a great place for a date at night and you can enjoy the great crowd afterwards with great conversation and ambiance to fit"
5,"Mexican places like this need to be judged based on consistency  heres what I mean

42 of the time Ive been hungover
30 of the time Ive been drunk
22 of the time Ive been sober
6   of the time other

Food tastes great no matter what and its right down the street"
5,Along with pretty much everyone else who has left a review for this place I LOVE THIS PLACE I grew up in the area and one night my dad and brother wanted to check it out my brother is a Yelp addict and saw it had amazing reviews I was skeptical since driving past it is your typical hole in the wall kind of place but I was not disappointed at ALL The carne asada burrito is amazing even the salad it comes with is great I think my favorite thing aside from that would have to be the aguas frescas particularly the orange oneSO good You probably will not regret ordering a single thing from this menu Ive gone back countless times one time bringing one of my friends who was convinced that anywhere a blonde gringa tried to take her for Mexican food would be craptastic but she loved it too
1,"I wouldnt write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off I prefer Papa Johns pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut by far but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating

They cant find my house Its not hard to find I swear Its a piece of cake and a stones throw from a major crossroad They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza saying they tried to call me they didnt only to return to the store and bring it back once I called Naturally I was delivered a lukewarm pizza but in the nicest way possible was told that it was my mistake  Unacceptable in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line 

Without complaining I had received a coupon for a free large pizza Apology accepted Upon visiting the store I got to keep the card after ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings Suckers

Also they always take longer than the ETA even in the middle of a weekday Even now I am waiting 70 minutes for a 3040 minute order and when I had called 15 minutes ago was told it was on its way but that construction was holding it up Yes there is construction but you have taken this long in the past without it Also construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza I even tip nicely

I enjoy Papa Johns pizza but unless my complaints are addressed I will never order from this location again I will encourage my friends to follow suit RAWR"
5,"By now youve heard the adventures at the Rustlers Roost  httpwwwyelpcombizrustlersroostephoenixhridgYib8eA4hDfylSs17Zcg  But my adventures in Phoenix didnt end there 

My BGF had been hounding me for days to find some great Q He was convinced that AZ would have great Q on every corner Now referring back to the link above I admit that I had a wee hangover at the time Anyway Ill press on We chose this place because BGF thought that this would be the spot 

I ordered the roast garlic chicken and realized with my first bite that I had died most likely alcohol poisoning from the night before and was now in heaven This was the best freakin chicken that I ever tasted Of course Im in heaven and BGF is grousing about the Q not being any good 

Now Ive listened to this all week from him 

 This Q is too Spicy 
 This Q is too wet 
 This Q wont fall off the bone 
 This Q doesnt have the right flavor 

Ill admit it I snapped And I didnt forgive him for about 2 weeks I went up one side and down the other If you dont like the gosh darn loosely translated Q in AZ the quit ordering the Blankity Blank translation again stuff Needless to say I got quite the look from BGF and boss Boss was actually laughing at us 

Anyway I took pity on my BGF and shared some of my chicken and he fell in love I dont know why it wasnt a rooster  oops I digress Anyway it was decided then and there this is the best chicken around hands down"
5,"I love this restaurant  I really enjoy the reverse happy hour from 10pm12am after I see a movie  The appetizers are 12 price and they have some really good drink specials better if you are a lady   l like sitting out of the patio and relaxing

The sushi rolls are good  So are the avocado eggrolls

Before I was a vegetarian the only thing I would order was the macademia crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and a creamy soy sauce"
1,"It is what you would expect from any themed place called Heart Attack Grill  Mirrors on the bottom part of the bar so you can see up the skimpy outfits the nurses wear at the bar  Van in the drive through section is painted to look like an Ambulance  Hamburgers are named after cardiac events

The food was bad greasy unlimited fries and a giant hamburger that tasted as if they mixed in filler of some kind we had never experienced before

If you plan on going enjoy the experience cause the food will not be something you would head back for again"
5,Great variety  Great price  Beats other buffets in the East Valley
5,"We just tried this out this afternoon following lunch at Pita Jungle next door   Its a selfservice yogurt shop where you pay by the ounce once youve finished your creation  

The offerings included the standard vanilla and chocolate but also less traditional offerings like Irish Mint and Red Velvet were also available  They offer a taste of any of the products and you can mix multiple types of yogurts in your container  They also offer a variety of standard yogurt shop toppings for your creation

I had a combination of the Irish Mint and Latte yogurts with a couple of toppings  The yogurt itself was smooth creamy and well flavored

Well likely be dropping by here in the future"
5,Great place  I love that they feature wines from the little guys  You wont find most of what they feature at any Total Wine or Bevmo  Small business supporting small business totally awesome in my eyes  The staff is knowledgeable and ooooh Chef Sarah  your food pairings with the wine in the wine 101 course were AMAZING  Katie the sommelier is fun and she knows her stuff plus it is clear that she loves to share her knowledge of wine with everyone  Ill be back for sure
5,Id give it about a 45 but I like rounding up for local businesses  The owner has been in there every time Ive shown up and the food comes out hot  The prices are spot on what youd expect to pay and so is the quality  Im not from Chicago and have only been there a couple times so I wouldnt be able to speak to its authenticity  but I can speak to its taste and the great customer service the crew provides every time  If youre in the neighborhood and thinking about a hot dog burger fried zuccini italian beef sandwich or chicken burger skip Sonic and DQ  they cant touch this place with a 15yard drivethru window
5,Best muffler shop in town There are VERY few shops that I trust and Mighty Muffler is one of them  Greg has worked on multiple cars and has always done a great job  If there is ever any issues he takes care of the problem no questions asked
5,"Aiellos is my favorite Italian spot in the Valley  In fact I day dream about the Mushroom Ravioli Special  you can taste the love in this dish   Great ambiance and a wonderful experience  The staff are always attentive and professional  The Owner makes a stop or two to make sure youre having a good time and they even let chance decide who pays for dinner you or the house

Helpful hint  Try no to get stuffed on the tasty bread and hot peppers served before the entree youre going to want to finish it"
5,Ive been here a couple of times  The first time was on first fridays  I expected it to be packed but I was able to walk right in and be seated  They had a table reserved and they must not have shown so we lucked out  I got the Sante Fe a roast beef panini and it was great  They had some good beers on tap too  Its a cool little funky place to grab a good sandwhich  The second time I came here it was after a concert  There was some horrible band playing that I wish would have shut up so I could hear the people in front of me without having to feel sharp pains in my ear but the meal was still good and I liked it  Any place that is open late close to downtown is perfect especially since the kitchen doesnt close until 1230
5,"I still want to live here  Its quite possibly the only vegan restaurant I could see myself flying here to eat at then going home    

Ive tried a number of things and have come to the conclusion that this is the combination that will satisfy me each time  

Green Burger with thyme fries and the Cookies n Cream Tsoynami  

Their Green Burger trumps The Plant Cafe and Roam in SFthe only two places Ive been to that somewhat mimic it at least in color"
5,"This place is a dream  Designer blouses for 1700  Seven jeans and Hudson jeans for 20  Steve Madden shoes for 25  I could go on the store is beautiful wellorganized and full of things that are in perfect or nearperfect condition  Some items are still quite pricey but most of the store is extremely reasonably priced  

If you need something new very quickly for a date or an interview or a special occasion you will probably find it here  The employees are nice friendly helpful and the dressing rooms are good as well  Love it"
1,I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary SICK  I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it  The service was even worse the manager I think stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 minGROSS
1,"AWFUL HORRIBLE
IT was just HORRIBLE experience 

I made an appointment for mani and pedi and came in Friday morning at 10 am There was only one lady working there no bage with her name She said she could take me earlier than 10 I said its fine she asked me  to pay cash right away only cash she said And ask me to go to ATM to get cash I was surprised but didnt think anything bad Later I realized that I didnt get any reciept so she just put my cash in her pocket because there were noone else there at that time

She started with manicure and it took her less than 10 min everything was done in 10 min She didnt even the nails didnt remove the cuticule she just polished the nailes with an old file Her work was so nigligent in everything Nail polish was all around the nails and my finger tips I suggested her to correct it and remove an extra polish around and she did it only on few nails repeating all the time Pretty Yes It was so far from looking pretty

Im a polite person by nature and never argue but here it was just awful And I payed her first together with the tips so she took 45 bucks from me

Her pedi was not better at all She was always in a hurry She didnt let my nails  dry and started putting my shoes on me I warned her that it must have been not done yet but she didnt listen she wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible so all the nails went messy She reapplied the polish but the whole procedure was just so frustrating I left the place more than just upsetI was really mad  

The next day the nail polish started to chip off on every other finger OMG I wanted to cry Its the worse mani and pedi Ive ever gotten in my entire life and I do it every month


I wish I had a reciept and could get back to talk to the manager but this lady just took my 45 bucks and left me with ugly really ugly work"
1,"Warning Douche Bag level CODE RED

Heres how my experience went  

Me May I have a Carmel Latte 
Employee No
 dead air 
Me Ummm why not
Employee We dont have carmel
Me Ummm I guess Ill just have a Cappuccino then
Employee Just so you know its a REAL Cappuccino
Me Okay in my head Im trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not

So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how hell be moving to downtown Phoenix soon To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho What a complete and utter douche bag Stay in Tempe poser and keep your employer there to

This experience was months ago and now they have opened up a shop downtown Guess what Im not going to check them out Fuck you Cartel Youll never be Lux so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you havent earned

Complete FAIL 

For my two cents skip this place and go to Lux in CenPhoMid Town right off the Light Rail Authentically cool with ZERO attitude great coffee and no douche bag employees 

And as for great coffee  try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool

 
please read owners comment below  heres my response  

Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner  I guess my new job  should be to promote good coffee in Arizona  and I dont appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee  

By that definition I guess I dont know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if its not acoustic or a good voice unless its A cappella  thanks for proving my point I wouldnt go here unless you are a total coffee snob  I guess they dont need your business you poser"
5,"This is the second time Ive eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first 

The first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places Ive been to in Phx

Its very Back East feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there especially the meat cheese and pasta counters

Check em out you wont be disappointed"
5,"Open Range offers some damngood home cooking My family eats here often and has never had a bad meal Not to mention that the portions are huge 

I usually order the cobb salad From a typical deli Id normally expect iceberg lettuce a handful of shaved carrots some egg and a little bit of bacon But if that were the case I wouldnt be ordering the salad again and again The field greens and romaine lettuce are served with avocado Im pretty sure they use at least 12 an avocado for each salad artichoke hearts tomatoes bacon no bacon bits here radishes blue cheese egg cucumbers  and Im sure im forgetting something else but it is GOOD Sometimes if Im really hungry I order it with a side of their twice baked casserole twice baked potato in a cup basically Its unbelievable Id also recommend the Arizona caviar black bean salad or southwest coleslaw

My dad loves their BBQ sandwiches with choice of homemade barbecue sauce  each one better than the last my mom usually orders one of their other great salads with a side of potato pancakes better than grandmas and grandpa loves whatever is on special Even my pickyeater brother loves food at Open Range  and thats saying something

Bethany and Tom are the owners Bethany does most of the kitchen cooking and Tom says that hes in charge of most of the barbecuein He once gave my family a taste of some of their freshly smoked pecans and WHOA they were GOOD The restaurant as the name suggests has a full service deli too in case you need a pound of freshly sliced ham as well as a meal

In the past the service has been slow but it has improved dramatically over the past year The restaurant has a killer view of the Superstition Mountains and is within 10  20 minutes of countless hiking trails 

To make this long review short if youre looking for a tasteslikehome or tastesbetterthanhome cooked meal and youre in the far east valley make sure to stop in for lunch or dinner Youll probably see my family and me chowing down too"
5,"One of the perks to being an only child is me time There is something special about having time to yourself when the only obligation you have is to check in on Yelp leave a quick tip and grab a lemonade from the mall because it is 109 degrees outside

Yesterday was that day I had stumbled across The Art of Shaving Ive been in their stores in other cities before Of course I havebecause if you look at any of my pictures you will realize a couple things 1 Im vain 2 Im hairless

As soon as you step foot into this store you are in a true gentlemans club Not the kind that will take all your dollar bills You wont make it rain here

This is the ultimate shaving store Soaps creams blades razors balms brushes and mugs You name it they have it

The staff knows what they are talking about I explained to them that I have a very old safety razor and a brush Both were passed down by my Grandfather who passed away when I was a teenager

They didnt pressure me into buying ANYTHING although I did end up leaving with some shaving cream They even gave me a proper demo on how to use it properly with my brush Ive been used to shaving soaps and the usual aerosol creamsso the little tutorial was nice

Also there is a master barber in the back of the house that does straight razor shaves haircuts and mens facials

Remember earlier when I said that me time is a perk This is the best place to spend it if you are a dude

If you are a woman buy your man or your manfriend a gift from here This place is simply amazing

One last warning The store is pricey but worth every single penny"
5,This location has closed  Went by today and found an empty restaurant
5,Just left I wanted to eat another pizza it was that good  The Biagga was fantastic Probably the best prosciutto style pizza Ive ever had  Owner and staff were very friendly   I will be back again
5,"If I were ever to be executed Id want a Meat  Cheese pasty for my last meal With two red wine gravy

Its that good"
5,"we keep driving by this place thinking it was just a coffee house but after reading some of yelps reviews learned it was much more its so cute and trendy inside they have so many yummy and healthy options we didnt know what to pick so we decided to go with the veggie breakfast burrito

it was light and filling much to our surprise and superbly tasty and best of all not gigantic more places should do thatoffer reasonably priced food that tastes great in manageable portions that way you dont stuff your face with a giant food plate and then feel like an obese slob the rest of the morning 
well hit this place up again for sure awesome staff too"
5,"Perhaps youve heard of the Library of Congress  Nice Library

Burton Barr Central Library has a bigger reading room

Wil Bruder was the Architect  You either love his work or you hate his work  I love his work  And this library is as good as it gets

Arrive in the sixth floor reading room a little before Noon on the Summer Solstice  Ask a librarian  Theyll tell you why ah the mystery"
5,"Ive got two names for you  TYLER  MARCO   superstar instructors at the Y

Ive been an avid gym member at various gyms for years and I have to say the YMCA downtown cant be beat for the 85 pm work schedule person who likes to attend the gym during lunch or right after work  Im all about the group exercise classes and this Y offers an array of classes such as spin kickboxing Zumba Yogalates Boot camp water aerobics Hatha Yoga etc etc

Back to my fav instructors  Tyler and Marco  Boy do these boys kick my ass every time I take their classes Tyler teaches spin and offers not only strong knowledge and great tips on making your spin experience the best that it can be he has a kickass playlist of music to motivate his class  Marco is a very intense and interactive kickboxing instructor who keeps pushing you with great music mixes to keep his class sweating the weight and stress away

Thank you Tyler and Marco for making my workouts intense and fun  After years of going to different aerobic classes Im FINALLY seeing the results

PS  You cant beat the staff that works there  Erica who manages all the group exercise instructor welcomes any suggestions or comments with a smile  Freddie at the front desk is also very helpful and sweet"
5,Love this place  Was in phoenix 3 weeks for work  Ate here 3 times  The squid salad is amazing  They also have sushi bibimbap and tons of other items  Must try
5,I dont think there is anything else to be said about Delux its been around and they offer nothing but great food the Classic Burger and the Delux burger are both very delicious  I like Delux better and I do recommend medium rare the quality of the meat is unbelievable  Love the sweet fries I do prefer the mixture of both sweet and regular fries
5,Outdoor shopping at its best probably not the best if its hot outside but great outdoor dining and misters 
5,You know the story about the cobbler who created all those adorable shoes for the elves in the village Ok so maybe that story doesnt go exactly like that Regardless I found Old Town Scottsdales version of the magical cobbler who can do wonders with shoes and I found it at Tonys Shoe Repair Here Tony keeps shoes in spic and span condition and if you bring them in looking anything but shiny and new you can be sure they will be returned as good as new Tonys Shoe Repair also handles purses and belts They do everything for a shoe including simple repairs such as widening and adding those little tricky bottom parts of heels that never seem to last to giving your worn our shoes an entire face lift The prices here are reasonable and he does the work for you in a speedy time frame I dropped off my sad looking boots off and he freshened them up and added new heel bottoms to them in a days time The fairytales can keep their magical cobblers here in the real world weve got something even better  Tonys Shoe Repair
5,"How many great things can one say about the Cartel Does Infinity work Yes that was a statement not a question I am in love with the CC hands down I have traded my gold Starbucks card in for this amazingly Delicious start to my day The iced coffee  actually its Toddy which is better is amazing They roast their own beans and allow the iced coffee to sit over night creating an extremely potent concoction The hot drinks A as well And the food A 5 yup its that legit Grab the cheddar bacon muffin its literally heaven No joke Heaven Little clouds may form above your head white clouds of course Not those nasty rain clouds OK maybe not clouds But defiantly your day will be sunny because you stopped into Coffee Cartel And not because you live in AZ Duh 

Only complaint I have is the hours I live right next door and their only open MF like so many places in DTPho 

PLLLEEEEAAAASSSEEEEEE open up for the weekends Ill work for free Wellwait Ill come visit"
5,Cute cozy pleasant and very friendly service That is really all I have to say about them The food was oh so delicious Little bite sized tacos Service was fast and just perfect They even use the square card reader on their iPad to charge cards Which truly shows its a small and quaint restaurant
5,I have used Todd on at least a dozen occasions I am a property investor and I buy multiple homes I need Todd for EVERY house I do and he is ALWAYS there for me He even got me into my own car once At the drop of a hat he is there for me His knowledge is excellent his demeanor is fantastic and his service and workmanship is excellent I would NEVER use another locksmith unless he was dead or out of town In which case I would probably ask him to come home  Use this guy Hes great
5,"My pants get tight when I think about Pho Thanh
There is little else that I can say that would more accurately convey my love for this restaurant"
5,This place is great The first time I went in I didnt have change for the parking meter and they easily helped me out Adrian cut my hair and did a great job Everyone was friendly and made you feel welcome
5,"Indiana University went to a bowl game for the first time in a crazy number of years

And my big little cousin is one of their defensive ends  So it was my pleasure to end 2007 watching the Hoosiers play the Cowboys of Oklahoma State University  I cant think of any better way to finish off whats been a crazy yearthough it was improved by being joined in the stands by Nadia C soontobe G and her adorable fiance Ben  

I dont understand football so the game was kinda secondary for me but being amongst all those screaming fans and the cheerleaders and the band was great  Id forgotten that energy since leaving my sports loving home town

But the game was pretty good Would have been better if Kellen Lewis would have completed 60 or more of his passes  Or if the Hoosiers had won hey coachDEFENSE  But football is pretty awesome from only 5 rows up  Add some people watching guy in red pants and wig constructive advice to the IU dance team buy new uniformssomething along the lines of the sparkly orange dresses of the OSU girls and the awesome Marching Hundred who knew that mainstream marching bands play riding dirty  And we had a blast

The only downer was not being able to visit with my cousin after the game  For security reasons they wouldnt let family and friends see the players at the stadium  Since I wasnt staying at the hotel and didnt know what hotel that was I wasnt able to see him  I was terribly disappointed to come all that way and not be able to give him a hug and give him a hard time about growing up to be a big burly football player  In my head hes still 12 and  gangly and trying to grow into his feet and his ears  But its great to see that hes a grown man in college playing football and playing for a team thats getting better every season

So GO BIG RED  And hopefully there will be another bowl visit to kick off 2009"
5,Weve take our daughter to Dr Ramirez at TLC since we were released from the hospital  Ive seen all but one of the four doctors and have been extremely pleased with all of them  They offer both a sick and well child waiting room  Our daughter loves the themed rooms  With small children you will have the inevitable emergencies that require a doctors visit  My child is two now and we have never been unable to get an emergencysick appointment  Our phone calls have always been promptly returned on the same day  Anything they told us they were doing was done as promised  I cannot recommend them highly enough
1,I ate at Scramble last Friday and I have to say that it was a horrible experience  What attracted me to this place was the separate vegan menu in addition to their regular menu  this makes things easier when dining with vegan and nonvegan friends  So I happily ordered a tofu wrap and added fried potatoes as a side and awaited my food  We started eating and my friend found a hair in his foodnot good  He threw it on the floor and tried to drop it  Well moments later I found a hair in my food  I couldnt believe there was hair on both of our plates  I was so disgusted I could no longer eat my food and I was ravenous  I told the girl working the register about the whole ordeal she walked back to the kitchen then back to the register and completely ignored me she said shed come back to my table  Before we left I spoke with someone else and showed them the hair clearly not one of mine  All I got was Oh Ill check the guys in the back  Check the guys in the back  What  How about sorry may I refund you your money  Additionally the few bites I had of my burrito were pretty bland it needed seasoning or hot sauce  Overall I wouldnt go backunless I somehow develop a taste for hair although Im sure that wont happen  I did take a picture of my food before I attempted eating it and if you zoom in enough you can see part of the hair sticking out of my food  Ill be posting them
5,"Oh AJs  How do I love thee  Let me count the ways BEERS 123200

They have so many different beers to choose from here  If you ever need an ingredient that is out of the norm they will have it  If you ever need an ingredient for a special dinner that MUST be fresh and ripe this is the place

From 10 differnt types of flower 15 different brands of pasta to 20 different types of EVOO if youre making a really great dinner spend the extra couple of bucks and get your stuff here

One day Ill be able to afford the prime steaks"
5,This little joint is right down the street from my crib and Ive had the chance to dine here on several occasions take out and dine in Each and every time its been great Extremely fresh ingredients and even better prices Great local place to get some great grub on a small budget Highly recommended
1,"despite its billing as the largest thrift store in north america im pretty sure this is the island of misfit goodwill items the place is huge but ive never ever found anything good in this store im not sure how thats possible but i would never go out of my way to shop here

i have no bathroom report for this location because ive never been in there long enough to actually go"
5,My wife turned me on to this gem Her family has been eating here since the 70s it never disappoints The machaca is moist not wet like many others The Pepsi from the fountain is the best fountain soda anywhere
5,I love this place The owner is always there and you can tell he takes great pride in what he does Great food and great customer service
5,The best fried calamari in Surprise Delish pizza Consistent quality and service never have been disappointed since we moved here in June
5,I loved Joes Farm Grillyou havent lived until you have tried the Blue Cheese Burgernot sure what it is named on the menuI fancy steak encrusted with blue cheese this burger is the next best thing  Their garlic fries are to die forheck everything they cook is incredibleworth the drive
5,Best pizza in the valley that Ive had Ive yet to do Pizzaria Banco  Great service always made fast and GREAT pricingdoenst travel well so if youre gonna have it in your car for a while I wouldnt recommend itI think thats why theres a lot of soggy crust comments etc
5,Best pizza in AZ hands down
1,"I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight  The lobby salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce

I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up"
5,I dont think Ive ever been to this place when its not been crazy busy Its just a small little eatery but its always busy They have some great food and the peanut butter pie is delicious Just a place to hang out and enjoy some breakfast lunch dinner or snacks at Parking isnt the best and that is a problem but if you live close and can walk its ideal
5,They have the nicest staff and the Dr is always open when examining our dog We have boarded her there as well and the staff is so kind and when our dog gets there she cant wait to run up and play with the staff
5,Tried this place for the first time tonight and was impressed with absolutely everything Welllit building in a decent location in the Arcadia area I drove here from the Garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it Juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries along with one of the best slices of toast Ive ever had All three of these foods were still crispy when I got home which almost never happens with fast food I wish I had gotten the girls name who took care of me She was cute as a button very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions Ill be back here soon
5,Great spa If you dont mind spending a few bucks this is the place for you Neat water fall room roof top pool and eucalyptus room Ive had multiple massages here  they were exceptional Outstanding customer service too
5,"I cannot get enough of LGO

My favorite time to come is very early in the morning to enjoy the sun coming up over Camelback Mountain while having some organic coffee and a blackberry bran muffin

The breakfast at LGO has something for everybody IMO Try the Croque MDame if you want something really bold 

The lunch and dinner options are great too This is the only restaurant I have ever been that I could eat all three meals and feel like I was being served from a different kitchen each time

The only draw back I can think of for LGO is the tendency for it to become very crowded Thats the best problem a restaurant can have so theyre probably not too worried about it The parking situation can become an issue too but for my time and money its worth it

LGO is top notch in my book and you can find me there pretty regularly"

Ive eaten at Liberty Market a few times already but this morning marked my first breakfast and what a fantastic meal it was of pancakes 3 in a stack 65 httpwwwyelpcombizphotos3N9U549Zse8UPMwKZAjAQselectXg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZgXg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w added topping of marketmade granola 1 a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs 35 httpwwwyelpcombizphotos3N9U549Zse8UPMwKZAjAQselectMMwKpMltbKCWNNlraItGwMMwKpMltbKCWNNlraItGw and a doubleshot of espresso 2 httpwwwyelpcombizphotos3N9U549Zse8UPMwKZAjAQselectM1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQgM1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg  Service was in fine form I couldnt have the marketmade maple syrup blend nor any of the housewhipped cream blueberry compote raspberry and apricot jams or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about and when I asked for chocolate chips I was instead offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate sugar and coco oil good stuff  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes too  FYI I didnt really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs the two paired well

Ive mentioned this once before but I think its such a great thing to yelp about again buy an espresso or any of their specialty coffees and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal  Not like I needed more caffeine after the doubleshot but I did have some of the houseblend coffee  After 15 pancakes the meatballs watch out theyre very greasy and caffeine Ill be good to go for a few hours despite only having four hours of sleep  Im hoping anyway

ps  Despite tipping more than 20 at the cashier upon ordering I thought Bruce the server who took care of me at my table deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much  

Addendum  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go gratis  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market

5,"Delish x 100

Love love love this place This is the place that made me a Vietnamese fan for sure My friend brought me here and I was blown away but the tastiness of their food Their spring rolls are so yummy The chicken noodle soup flavor is a winner in my book Everything on the menu is delicious though I havent tried is all Im sure it is"
5,"Went here tonight with the padres and husband  This place is the whole Joes BBQJoes Farm Grill owners  We saw that it was the highest rated here on Yelp for restaurants in Gilbert 

Paper menus are available near the counter where you order your meal  We started with the Hummus  olives appetizer  Mom and I shared the Apricot Chicken with mashed sweet potatoes Dad had some steak sandwich with horseradish that was very tasty husband had the Salmon BLT with avacado  I tasted everything and ALL the food was delicious 

There were also very interesting and unique beer and wine offerings  There is an espresso bar that sells various coffees as well as some sweet stuff  There is still a little market in the back selling local olive oil from Queen Creek Olive Oil Mill as well as pasta pure vanilla extract and other items

I highly recommend a trip to Liberty Market for a fresh homecooked meal"
1,"I have been here once for lunch and sat outside only to get eaten alive by flies nothing worse than eating outside on a nice patio and being pestered the entire time 

I decided to give it another chance for happy hour well guess what flies followed me inside too 

I dont know if it was the time of year early spring or what but they really need an exterminator"
5,Enjoyed date night here with the hubby Try the gluten free pizza AMAZING Mmmmmmm
5,As a vegetarian with a fairly adventurous palate I love Ethiopian food And now that I work in northern Tempe Im here all the time Its filling flavorful and inexpensive I can have a pretty big dinner for less than 10 If you like me think spiced though not particularly spicy vegetables are the greatest things on Earth definitely pay a visit to Blue Nile
5,This is an amazing taco truck just minutes from the airport I ordered the amazing ceviche and a barbacoa burrito while my girlfriend ordered three tacos Ive said it before and Ill say it again here this truck is an excellent example of the inverse correlation between price and taste in Mexican food Eat here before your next flight
5,I was truly impressed by the quality of service and the knowledge of the employees I have had my ears pierced at Claires when I was 4 way to go Dad and an industrial piercing performed at Club Tattoo I went in to adjust my bar bell for my industrial piercing and they explained a lot of things I had no clue about like the difference in threading The place is clean and every one is friendly I will ONLY ever go to HTC when I need to handle my current piercings or want to get another Thank you
5,"Check this outI JUST HAD A RUBEN FOR BREAKFAST 
I saw the article about this place in the Tempe newspaper We were already heading to the Healing Field at Tempe Town Lake91110 and wanted to stop for breakfast We had the dogs with us so choices were limited My boyfriend went into Stans and they let us sit on the patio with the pups 
They serve their entire menu all day Im not a huge eggs and bacon kind of person so I love having something a little different in the morning 
I ordered the Ruben and allowed Kelly the waitress who was fabulous to choose the side 
The food took a little while to arrive 
When it didHoly Cow 
My sandwich was huge and she brought all three sides so we could taste them all That is great customer service My favorite was the slaw then potato salad 
The food was fabulous and the staff was more than accommodating The owner stopped by our table and chatted awhile 

I will no doubt be back Thank you so much Stans for the wonderful start to my day"
5,"We have been here now several times  This Is one of the best restaurants we have ever been to  The food and service is absolutely the best   Most everything is cooked in their exposed kitchen  Everything off the grill is awesome

The servers will patiently answer all your questions and appear as though they really enjoy seeing you pleased with your experience

Since we have been here several times here is a list of some items we have had

For one if you dont mind spending the money the toro tour is great  They have something like 5 different kinds of toro  From real fatty to a little less  Melts in your mouth  The presentation is very impressive  It is served on ice with different kinds of salt and to us a very unique way of presenting the wasabi

All there other sushis are served perfectly prepared

The steak is excellent  The flavor is spectacular  grilled in view over an open flame and quite literally cooked always and without fail exactly to you specification

All tempura dishes are great

Grilled zucchini Very good and juicy

Seabass with miso  Cooked perfectly

I suggest you order to share and sit at the counter  It makes for a very good experience  This is the place where you should go in without worrying about cost  Just go for it tske your time and experience it all  It will make for a very good experience

Try their very unique drinks they are very refreshing

Or if you are real daring the tasting menu is literally a 4 hour experience  
Did it once  Its a bit long for us and wont do it again"
5,Love the pita jungle  My fave is the chicken and hummus appetizer  Definitely enough for a meal and super cheap too  Also love the chicken swarma sandwich and the chicken pizza  You cant go wrong here
5,A must when you visit the Heard   The staff is very professional     James Lora and Allison are excellent     The shop is first class   Great place for a collector      Some of the finest Native American art available          Highly recommend a visit       You will be amazed
5,Great flavors even though there arent many to choose from Fresh fruit is such an awesome feature as most places are def not and limited to the healthy choices of topping I visit as often as I can
5,"Great facial great customer service

One Love Boutique Spa consists of the waiting roomreception area and the services room  Its small cozy but super cute and inviting I love the way its decorated which is what drew me to buy a Groupon for a signature facial after looking at the website The decor is white clean girly and classic

I was disappointed at first when my initial appointment was cancelled two hours before I was scheduled due to Amanda coming down with something that was contagious I guess I was thankful too

When I came in for my facial I explained that I was one of the appointments that was rescheduled due to her illness and she upgraded me to the anti aging facial for free  She also includes eyebrow waxing with every facial which is awesome The facial was AMAZING and Amanda is very knowledgeable about what she is doing and the products she is using 

Before my facial started I had asked her to mess up my hair as little as possible since I was going somewhere right after she kindly obliged  and when I left my hair looked exactly how it looked when I came in

Amanda is great and I will definitely be back"
5,"The best street tacos ive had  As authentic and cheap as it gets

If you do take out pick up a bombaros burrito for lunch for the next day as well its really hot but tasty

Dont tell me ATF or any other spot is better they dont come close unless you like your street tacos with sour cream cheese and lettuce LOL"
5,I love Jimmy Johns
1,I used to always go here for tires until my mechanic noticed my tires were the incorrect size  Back to Discount I go to correct the problem and they blamed me I was told that I must have chosen the smaller tires to save 20 bucks a tire  I ended up having to spend a lot of money on five new tires my spare is a full size as well three weeks before Christmas I wrote the company a letter to tell them how wrong I felt the entire experience was and I never heard anything back  I will not be going here for future tire needs
1,"The music is pounding

It reeks of ridiculously strong cologne masking young adult male insecurity

Some guy younger than my kid brother is walking around without a shirt

Everything is super overpriced for what you get

In the grand tradition of overcompensation and brand whoring there is a name plastered all over everything

No one is genuine either in their efforts to help or able to make real eye contact and stop texting

Is it a bar in Belltown in the late 90s Is it a frat party Is it a spring break trip

No its Pimpercrombie  Bitch Now I remember why it had been at least ten years since the last time I walked in one of these cesspools of humanity and child labor sweatshops Maybe next time I will wait 20 yearsif they make it that long"
5,"Torn between review Fez Foodies the periodic event that allows patrons to participate in sampling yettobeadded menu item and tweak them based on responses and the actual restaurant that hosts said event and providing a CenPho restaurant that combines innovative cuisine with ambiance and amazing service I settled on the latter Because without the brickandmortar there would be no former 

So tonight for the first time Robert M and I joined the Fez Foodies for a sneak peak at a few items that will be coming to a plate near you The raspberry spinach salad was wonderful The steak with mushrooms and smashed red potatoes might need another consideration but was still a pleasant entree Honestly I look forward to returning and getting these items because Fez actually takes customer inputsuggestions and applies them 

Fez is one of those locations where Ive never gotten anything but terrific service and a great meal Im fond of the garlic and rosemary fries but my coworkers and friends and strangers on the light rail think I should limit myself on these as some people dont appreciate the proven medical benefits of bucketloads of garlic and shovelfuls of rosemary Tools 

Not surprisingly Thomas was a peach of a host Forgive me if I seemed disinterested in conversation we just returned from Rim Country and that experience killed my ass"
5,Ahhh ShadysI am a little embarrassed to admit how often I frequent this gem of a place but definitely not ashamed of how much I love it  Cool atmosphere just the right lighting very important to me great bartenders good prices on a really nice selection Who else has Old Raj gin or Agwa De Bolivia   This is definitely not a dive bar not that theres anything wrong with that but its not an icey blase Snobbsdaleish joint either and Ive never felt ridiculed or snubbed here either by patron or bartender  Ive seen all walks of life come through this place but never felt that it was too hip or pretentious in any way Great jukebox obscure forgotten movies playing on the telly bartenders that are nice to look at male and female have personality and actually remember your name and drink  Does it get any better than this
5,"I really enjoy this place Its beautifully designed Its hidden in a historic neighborhood zoning issues so no patio and they make they own tonic What else does one need 

But now the food Rich full flavored comfort food I dont think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell just some of the best food around 

Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts awesome A potato side dish damn good I tell you For the main course the skirt steak which was some of the best red meat Im had in a very very long time 

This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix Seriously"
5,Excellent I love this place
1,Staff was very rude bowling prices werent displayed to the best of their ability extreme bowling itself was over priced almost 20 per person The only thing about their extreme bowling was that it was extremely hot temperature wise they had many ceiling fans and not one of them turned on And the bowling equipment malfunctioned three times during our games It was not a pleasant experience and I dont believe well be going to this facility again
5,Okay ya wanna know a little secret I LONG for Green Ever since moving back to New Orleans Im surrounded by an embarrassment of culinary riches but our one vegetarian restaurant can never hold its own against Green I passed through Scottsdale a few weeks ago to visit the Grand Canyon and the second I stepped off the plane at the Phoenix airport and secured the rental car we drove straight to the restaurant Everything was just like I remembered it and slightly better The staff was warmer and the food just as good Im still thinking about the crab puffs and the eggless rolls
5,"As someone who LOVES Thai food I can really appreciate a good Pad Thai and Wild Thaigers is my favorite hands down

Just like the menu says their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors to the point where every bite is unique  If you love Pad Thai and havent tried Wild Thaigers you need to  If you dont love Pad Thai its probably because you havent tried Wild Thaigers    Seriously this is one of the best dishes Ive found in Phoenix

Their other dishes are consistently good as well  I love Chicken Satay but most places only offer it as an appetizer with a few skimpy chicken strips  Wild Thaiger on the other hand has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch as well as a Peanut Passion dinner both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner but if youre going for lunch you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras

Their Thai Tea is strong yet creamy just like it should be and you can even add boba to it  A must if youre eating anything spicy

The service is very professional and timely  The atmosphere is pretty classy in fact its probably the nicestlooking Thai restaurant Ive been to  Its also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio  All in all it has a very welcoming atmosphere  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a Tshirt and jeans  Its a great place for dates business lunches or just some great takeout  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints but the quality more than makes up for it I would say the prices are spoton

One day Ill learn how to write a review thats short and sweet but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place  Highly recommended"
1,ok so heres what they teach  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person  Stealing is okay lying is okay as long as it is done by you but for the others they have no place in society so pillage and destroy them it is your right and you will be rewarded for that  Wow
5,"Wow I am very impressed The store is very big and they seem to have it all  even the hard to find odd items It looks like everyone can shop here

The store is mapped out and sectioned nicely too Finding things is easy and if you cant or dont want to the very friendly staff are there to help It looks like they employ people who know a thing or two about the supplements also so whether you are looking for digestive health immune support weight loss muscle building herbs beauty or whatever they have it and they can tell you about it Pretty Good 

You can even get a customer rewards card and build up bonus points to get discounts and stuff And they can track your purchases with it should you ever like me loose your receipt

What I am really impressed with though is their customer service and return policy I did not expect them to accept a return and refund my money on 2 items that I purchased there because I lost the receipt Especially since I did not purchase it on a member card so they could not track my purchase either I thought I would try my luck with it anyway and was hoping for an exchange Well the clerk was so nice to me She said that it was no problem and would gladly refund my money I didnt even ask for a refund and I had opened one product I was speechless and felt a little guilty about it too  since it was almost a month that had passed I really didnt think theyd take them back Anyway I told her that an exchange would be more than appreciated and she said No problem again So I very guiltily walked over to get some of the items I needed They had them and they had them on sale  cheaper than I have ever seen and in more of a selection too 

Needless to say I walked out of there very happy but feeling a bit undeserving But that is what good  EXCELLENT  customer service is all about  exceeding the customers expectations 

This I my new store for all of my supplements and health  wellness needs I recommend checking them out They seem to have everything one could ever need Plus they have an entire wall and more dedicated to muscle weight and fitness  if that is your thing Also be sure to check out their website they even have customer reviews  ratings and product informationfacts and ingredients Really Cool"
5,I love this place The first time I went I fell in love with their fries and their secret sauce They have those great crinkle fries and they are made to order so they come out super crispy and hot They alone can stand on their own but I have to have the sauce It has to be a mixture of ketchup mayo probably some chili powder and some other stuff that I cant figure out No matter how many times I try to do it at home I never get it Once before I got the Italian Beef but being my first time I didnt know that you could get it wet Duh and ended up eating a warm roast beef sandwich that was a bit on the dry side After reading the Yelp reviews I realized that you can add all kinds of stuff to it I think that the girl at the register shouldve at least informed me that I had options The staff girls at the register werent all too friendly which makes for a less than pleasant experience right from the start Hopefully they arent there anymore Forward to today I decided to give it another shot and I am so glad I did The owner is a really cool guy and is always super nice when I come in He asked me all the questions about how I wanted the sandwich and put the dip in a to go cup for me so I wouldnt have a mush sandwich when I got home I added provolone and hot giardiniera which absolutely made the sandwich I didnt get to finish it because my other half smelled it and swooped in and polished it off and loved it too Good thing I got the fries I would highly recommend this place If you do have the Italian Beef you should try to eat it there instead of taking it home If you get embarrassed easily or worry about food all over your hands and face then dont eat this infront of other people I think it once you eat it you wont even care if it gets in your hair So I say get over it and get your butt down to Lobbys and eat til you explode
5,Love it Wish it was in my neighborhood
5,"Im giving Yolis 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location

Went there on a Saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away  Great little hideaway in downtown Chandler  I ordered the Morning Monte  It was delicious  My family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others plates and everything was excellent  My favorite item was the chorizo burro  Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices  The waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also

Another really great thing about this place is the prices  I dont think there are any items above 8 and most meals here are in the 67 range  Very reasonable for the good quality food you get

After breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site  We also got a chance to meet the owner of the property and she was super nice also  I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items"
5,This place has amazing frozen yogurt I had the strawberry with small pieces of fresh strawberries It was a wonderful treat in this heat since its yogurt and not ice cream its a little bit healthier
1,"I do not like this KFC or any really for that matter Every time I have been here the place is filthy I know they remolded the place and I have not been since then so I am not sure if the conditions are the same

The food is just not good in any way anymore Not that it was ever great but you could get some decent chicken and some sides and be content What the hell have they done to the mac  cheese It is so grossthe color is just not appealing and the taste is worse Food at this place has been served under temperature enough times to keep me from returning"
5,"Just a quick review to reiterate how truly great this place is

Theyve got soda lots of soda  Thats right I said soda Theyve got root beer sarsaparilla freaky foreign sodas teas waters and other things 

I love this place I have no complaints The only thing that would make this place better would be the addition of beer Man if these guys hooked up with the dudes that run the beer section of Topps  Liquors it would be unstopable"
5,All I can say is DELICIOUS  Service was great food was great and the restaurant looks beautiful
5,Fried Squash blossoms  How do they come up with this stuff  FnB gets 5 stars for creativity and service oh and the food is pretty amazing too   The menu changes with the season so I apologize in advance for making your mouth water by mentioning  food youll probably never taste   We started off with the appetizer special Fried Squash blossoms stuffed with burrata served with fresh tomato sauce and an order of naan with eggplant puree  The Naan plate was nothing special but the blossoms were fantastic  For dinner Hottie had the lab chops with couscous and I had the pasta with butternut squash and pesto   The pasta was amazing I watched the chef make my pesto to order mmmm basil  Hottie devoured every bite so I would say he enjoyed his chops too  For desert we shared the panna cotta with cherries it was the perfect ending to a great meal  This place gets 5 starts all the way from the moment we walked in the service was impeccable and the food was superb  Thank you FnB
5,best in the valley
1,So a friend of mine went here last Friday and they were double charged  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the 60 amount Which she claims and assumes was her tip on a 60 bill I get a 100 tips ummyeah I think I will skip this place for sure
1,"Terrible food terrible service

I ordered chicken fried rice The waiter brings me a bowl and says chicken fried rice right I look into the bowl and its a bowl of brown rice This must be a joke I tell him thats wrong and next me brings me a bowl of rice seemingly fried with vegetables and no chicken I bring that back to the counter and say my order had chicken in it bringing my receipt along So finally they bring me a bowl of chicken fried rice

Or at least their version of it

I didnt think it was possible to actually screw up something as simple as chicken fried rice The rice itself was cheap long grain rice It was inedible due to the how stalehard it was Like absolutely no water absorption And the rice was all covered in something that made it very wet and practically slimy Disgusting I have no idea how people can eat this

Oh and that server who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad Theres a nice picture on the wall which shows you what the salad is supposed to look like and its not lettuce wraps

The best thing about my meal was the fountain drink which cost 185 The Circle K in the same plaza has bigger cups for 99 cents"
5,Dr Koch and his staff are wonderful I know that I am in great hands and being given the best care possible They do a great job at working you in to the schedule if you have a last minute pain that needs some extra attention I would highly reccomend Arizona Chiropractic to anyone
5,My wife and I found Four Peaks by chance We got lucky The food was great service was great and all thr beers rocked My wifes fav was the Heff and the Arizona Peach We got a beer glass to remember the occasion and plan to swing by on the way out and grab a growler
5,"I have been to Cherryblossom countless times for lunch over the past few years I have to say the location kinda sucks but thats because of all the traffic Are they ever going to finish construction on Camelback 

Any way I decided to get a to go lunch order today Since it was actually chilly out I ordered the chashu ramen noodles with a couple of their yummy bread rolls  also picked up a slice of their amazing blueberry bread The rolls were yummy as usual  I ate half of the chashu so good  a big enough portion for me to have it again for lunch tomorrow 

Service can be slow there sometimes its best to go at 11am or after 1pm to beat the lunch crowd Other tasty items I have enjoyed here are cali crunchy roll double shrimp crunchy roll grilled chicken salad wginger dressing instead calamari edamame  I have tried a couple different pasta dishes which were surprisingly good"
5,"Navajo Food at its best  I loved everything there  I guess I love BLAND food   everything was terrific  

I ordered the bowl 12 oz of Mutton Hominy Stew I got it with the Tortilla bread which was AMAZING  I also ordered a side of Blue Corn Mush to dip into my stew  which is an awesome combination  And I also ordered a Grape Shasta Soda D  My Husband ordered the Vegetable Mutton Stew with fry bread and ordered Strawberry Shasta Soda He loved everything 

Everything was well worth the wait and the food was extra hot and tasted very FRESH  I LOVED IT "
5,Brought a friend from Louisiana here  She says that the crawfish etouffee here is the best shes had outside of Louisiana
1,UPDATE This location is closed Boo
5,Wow Best breakfast I had on my recent trip to Scottsdale Ordered the eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash Waitress sweet talked the cook into making a side order since they typically dont do side dishes That sweet little angel of a waitress made my day Best corned beef hash EVER Have I mentioned how awesome the waitresses were And damn pretty as well Double score
5,The name says it all This is one hot bagel shop This could be one of the best bagel shops Ive found in Phoenix and I would have never expected to find it way up in North Scottsdale This bagel shop is delicious The bagels are large hot soft and extremely delicious This local eatery has a line out the door on weekends and its for a reason The breakfast bagel sandwiches are todiefor The cheese egg and bacon combo sandwiched between a hefty bagel makes it worth waking up early on a Sunday morning I will be visiting again soon for the deli because I hear that its a must to stop by and experience their lunch
5,"A great restaurant staff They go above and beyond for their customer
Try the buffet you will not be disappointed
Bacon is cooked to perfection Fruit is fresh and the seating is perfect for large groups"
5,"Found Indulge on a whim based on their huge GlutenFree Menu outside  I was not disappointed when we decided to try it

Indulge has a separate glutenfree menu and the server was very knowledgable walking me through their kitchen processes to reassure me  

I ordered my burger on a glutenfree bun  the first time I was ever able to do this in a restaurant  That was EXCITING

I think Indulge is as good as you make it  you are given a menu to check off ingredients for your burger  They have SOOO many choices that its likely that if you dont like your burger YOU made the wrong choice 

I had no such problem  I loved my custom burger  It was cooked to the correct temperature was delicious  best of all was delivered on a tasty glutenfree bun 

PLUS though I was full it was a LOT of food I was able to take a glutenfree cupcake to go  wow was that ever heaven later  Thanks Indulge"
5,"Mellow Mushroom  WOW

As you may tell from recent reviews I have been on a Pizza crusade Well I took a friend to Mellow Mushroom today and the pizza rocked

We shared the Thai Die Pizza which had curry chicken and tasted awesome The crust was think and delicious the pizza burst with taste when I bit into it I am a traditional pizza guy but this diversion worked

Great service and a nice patio to eat topped it off

Ill be heading backsoon"
5,"Pauli from ATL checking in here just for a bit of nostalgia

I used to live in Phoenix a few years back and of all the places I miss eating at this is 1 on my list  I remember how I first heard of the place I was over at a friends house in Scottsdale having a few beers after work and remember asking him what his favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix was  My friend who had more than just a few beers in him stared at me all glassyeyed got right in my face and said Cheeeeno Banddddeeedo  As I backed up a bit thinking my friend had too much to drink he had for sure I wondered hmmmthe Chinese Bandit  What the hell is that place about  Or is he just fing with me  So I asked him what kind of food they serve there And as he did his best to focus on me when his eyes hit mine there was this long pause and he had this expression on his face that I cant forget I wasnt sure if he was having trouble putting it into words or if he was shing in his pants   And then he put his hands together like a nutjob working a Rubiks cube and said They dooo things like eggfoooo youngggg burrritos and jaaaade red chicken tacossssss as he gave me another crazyass look the kind that tells you its time to say goodnight and get outta there  which I did

So a few days later I remembered his drunken explanation of Chino Bandido and thought I would go check the place out And from that point on I was hooked   Egg foo young burritos indeed   And jerk fried rice   And those refried black beans with fireinthebungholio sauce mixed in Yep those will burn you twice All served in a giant disposable aluminum baking dish And you got that combo along with a soda and tip for about 10   WOW  

At that time I had never seen anything like it before and I still miss eating there more than any of my favorite old haunts in Phoenix I wish somebody would franchise one out to Atlanta  I would be the first customer in the door on opening day guaranteed"
5,"Off the chaincos lol

Today my friends and I pondered what to eat a good sandwich was was we decided on but where Looked right here on yelp and it came up most the reviews were good so we went for it WOW

I like to ask for a knock my socks off never been here suggestion and he offered up the cheese steak with peppers and mushroom I went for it but was on the fence for my pasta side dish he handed me a sample of the tortalini and I was in heaven

Service was polite the place was busy but not crowded it was clean and very appealing to look around while waiting for our order  Took about 10 minutes to arrive not bad

I thought the price was fair  and i could have went with just a half sandwich as it was very filling


While eating my buddy joked the place was off the chain and should rename itself to off the chaincos lol

Highly recommended and cant wait to take others here


Shawn"
5,"A chain yes But par for the course no 

First of all they have an extensive wine list which includes a rare type of sparkling wine called Brachetto In this area DUIs are more common than a cold and its a light and tasty wine with a low alcohol content So its option is great for me It also goes great with everything they serve because of its unique flavor profile

Lizzie was our waitress and offered options and suggestions which actually saved us quite a bit of money on the whole Not that by any stretch of the imagination is this a place to go when you are not intending a big splurge This is a place to take it slow and spend slightly over a decent amount 

The food however is absolutely worth it We tried the Cheddar fondue which could have used a bit more mustard powder and worstershire sauce but on the whole was delicious It was well prepped and Lizzie explained what she was adding and why the whole time The veggie selection is a bit mundane and thats really my only complaint We ate the big night out prix fix menu and chose the Fusion option which had lobster tail shrimp brats ravioli new york strip sirloin steak and a marinated chicken We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth Because its not oil you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didnt come home smelling like oil The california salad was incredible It had mixed greens sliced roma tomatoes chopped pecans and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing Its been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad and this was amazing The chocolate we chose was the Smore It was milk chocolate marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out Its served with 2 types of coated marshmallows pound cake a slice of cheese cake and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas Just enough to fill us up but we didnt overstuff ourselves Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about 2 to 2 12 hrs to get through This is pretty normal for fondue You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate if you are on a time constraint though 
Its located in a great little shopping and dining area that wasnt too crowed last night but I think that was more due to the weather than the actual popularity of the place"
5,"Jason Silberschlag pulls off a pretty amazing thing here in the metroPHX area  Three shops with their own quirky details passion and identity  Each tailors specifically to the demographic at hand which I can totally get behind  The fact that each shop has its own deal going on is awesome  I really dislike chains and the chain feellook  I hadnt seen Jason in a while at the other shops the times Id frequented and was happy to see him behind the bar when I came here for the first time

Just the same way the other Cartel shops have a selection of brewing methods this one does as well  Pourover aeropress Chemex and traditional espresso La Marz GS3

As expected from him our drinks were flawless  He transfers this knowledge and passion to the baristas which is obvious even when one leaves his establishment to go somewhere else  they stand out in the crowd of many coffeepullers  The beans who can complain  Jason made his name with the roasting

I got a prepared sandwich here and my was it tasty  Bread was fresh  Sauce ingredients and overall creation was good  Big Ben you stole my tastebuds heart that morning

Casual lounge area see couches outdoor covered seating see hallway  shaded and cool and plenty of seating inside  As normal his handiwork shines throughout the shop  Somehow Ive never reviewed a Cartel shop before despite my years of patronage  My latest experience changes that"
5,Im happy to say that Ive incorporated Guedos into my weekly routine  The food is excellent and the atmosphere is spoton Ive read several reviews where people complained about the food being overpriced but I really dont mind paying a little extra when it comes supporting local businesses especially a staple of the community like Guedos  If youre looking for a place with awesome food and an owner who cares to learn your name come to Guedos
5,"Overall I am a big fan of this place first how can you beat a place that is BYO  You never have to worry about a bad wine list or paying too much because it is your own stuff  I find the food excellent they menu is not large and changes often  but I have never had anything that I have no liked the chef is defiantly 5 star and since you bring in your own wine the prices dont seem that bad but it is not exactly cheap 

The only down fall of the place is that it is real small and has funky hours I think it is only open Wednesday to Saturday  I know that they take reservations and I would venture to say that is the only way to actually eat there This is a nice place for special occasions or a date"
5,Pizza has been delicious and fresh every time Ive been there The Chipotle pasta is absolutely the best though
5,I love this place They are so accommodating and the food is delicious They made a special meal for my daughter and were happy to do it Our server was helpful and friendly  I had the roasted beet salad and the ingredients were very fresh and tasty I cant wait to go back
1,The Management Group at this location need to make a better effort to control the number of people jumping theaters  My experience at this theater was one of the worst that I have ever had  I will never go back to that theater again  I felt that it was nothing but a complete money grab
5,i cant review restaurants in phx and leave out LGO breakfast coffee ambiance service pizza  5 stars happy hour 3 stars Not very many places beat this place out for saturday or sunday morning coffee and or breakfast after a nice wrkout run hike or anything else at home in bed with your better half must see for my visitors
5,"I love the always smiling crew and food is delicious
50cents coffee in the morning outside tables with sun exposure and friendly clientele all this in the beautiful kierland commons
Good morning America"
5,"AlasIve given up the idea of writing a review for a place if it isnt at least 4 stars Sue me Im in the industry 

Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places Ive been to recently I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date Ironically its super close to my house yet Ive never heard of it When we were arriving I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there arent any signs really and its pretty hidden Once we were inside though it was like finding a little treasure

The patio is welcoming  even though we didnt have a reservation aka we couldnt sit outside we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather 

We started off with a round of mojitos and even though its been a few years since theyve won best mojitoI can say the Prickly Pear was the best Ive had in a while The Ahi Tostadas followed  they were awesomethe sauce added a kick to it  it was a perfect start to the meal

After we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo chicken mushrooms peppers  a chipotle cream saucehuge What I did eat of it was delicious My favorite and my dates Im fairly certain was the specialan herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce homemade cornbread  chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes Amazing Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit the two sides arent  are so good Im droolin just thinking about it 

Dessert Try the banana burrito Heaven on the tongue

Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night Its hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that

If youre in the areacheck it out If you arentcheck it out Im pretty sure you wont be disappointed"
5,"Wow
Being a Phoenix native we have enjoyed many a meals at the hands of Chef Gross But this past weekend I was blown away

I was planning a large garden party for my friends bridal shower The record temperatures left my garden ravaged by the heat and I did not want to have sweltering ladies unable to enjoy themselves After a small response to attendance I decided to see what some of my favorite dining spots could offer me

I had a small budget but wanted to keep it classy Christophers truly rose to the occasion Alex was my special event contact and this lady was on it Emails and phone calls were returned at lightning speed She presented a delightful menu with plenty of choices some even for the vegetarians attending all with in my price range 

We had a wonderful time We had a party of 18 in the beautiful private room that fit our festivities perfectly Sundays can be quiet at The Biltmore Fashion Park so it lended us to a bit of intimacy that was nice Ben was our go to guy He was right there for every thing we needed and his helpers were polite and attentive
As for the food well its Chris come on I had the vegetable risotto ans  it was cooked to perfection All of the plates came out of the kitchen quickly and all together but no one ever made us feel rushed Wine flowed desserts were gobbled up and the ladies oohed and awed over everything the staff even offered to take gifts to the car for the bride

Thanks for saving me Chef Chris and your team You were all fabulous and I will be telling all of my friends what a great job you did The holidays are coming and Ben reminded us that they also do catering Hmmm can you say Christmas Party"
5,The food on its own is very good probably worthy of a four star rating by itself especially considering how difficult it is to find even passable Italian food in the West Valley  I bumped Grazie up from fourstars to fivestars because the service is very very good ownership is attentive and the atmosphere is very pleasant  As for the pizza in particular for a NY native finding decent pizza in Phoenix is close to impossible Good thincrust Italianstyle as opposed to NY or Chicagostyle like what they have at Grazie does happen to be a bit easier to execute and Grazie does it well Would I have loved to find a great NY or Chicagostyle slice instead Sure but good pizza is good pizza nonetheless
5,WOW Carmel sundae was amazing
1,"My husband and I were really really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34000 miles and out of warranty to have the moon roof looked at  The moon roof wouldnt open or close but you could hear the motor working

After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track  which would cost over 3000  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered due to the fact that its a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty  We were flat out denied  Twice  

We were dreading the big repair and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop which will get a big fat 5 star review for a second opinion  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out  Seriously  Just over 100 later we were on our way

I find it VERY hard to believe that Coulter didnt know this was the problem  We are now searching for a new SUV and will not be choosing Infiniti  How disappointing"
1,"I have have been going to Bosa off and on since they opened Have a bad experience and stop for a while Then I tell myself  Its right down the street why not  then disappointment again 

1 Went in on a Fri at 630AM for their special curler donuts that they ONLY do on Fri Sure enough nothing was prepared Was informed it would take another 30 min to finish the donuts Noticeable very very very irritated I ordered 2 other donuts instead Was planning on a dozen but had to settle for what they had Well staff made sure to charge me a credit card fee due to my purchase being under  500 When you dont have what you advertise you might want to waive the 50 fee Or you will really piss off that customer Common sense

2 Customer service is horrible See 1

3 When I get home I have never received the correct dozen donuts I ordered I dont understand it  Im perplexed  I dont think its anything personal I just never get the correct dozen They close the box I pay and go home Surprise

The donuts are OK nothing great and not bad they are donuts They are convenient and close but I must remember to pass on Bosa Donuts"
5,"Nobody likes going to the auto body shopperiod 

These guys took a negative situation and absolutely turned it around They immediately made me feel at home from the moment I approached the front desk all the way up to the ownership of the shop It was a professional experience with a family friendly approach The work they completed on the rear bumper of my car was excellent I HIGHLY recommend Impact AB for your AB repair needs

Tom Butka was a pleasure to work with Thanks Impact AB for everything"
5,Good service Excellent value I went for the All You Can Eat deal they have from 29 PM and was there for a few hours Im not fat or anything I just felt like finding a good place to study and eat for a bit The server was pretty attentive and the kitchen staff was pretty fast I was kind of disappointed that the menu for the all you can eat deal was missing many of my favorites from the regular menu but there were still quite a few good choices
5,"This is one of my favorite goto places in Phoenix and I feel fortunate to live just a mile away 

The atmosphere is excellent  lowlighting wooden floors modern decor in a vintagelooking houseturnedrestaurant 

The food is even better I have never ordered anything I didnt love with the exception of the cheesecake which isnt made inhouse  it was just okay I crave their tuna salad on a regular basis  its good both in the tuna salad salad and in the tuna salad sandwich  The grilled cheese is the bomb and so is the cashew butter banana sandwich The mac and cheese is superb as well Seriously everything rocks I highly recommend ordering the mixed greens as your side if you get a sandwich  the dressing is light and citrusy and smacks of homemade excellence 

Oh and it wont empty your wallet either The prices are excellent for the quality of food you get"
5,I hate to admit it because I usually avoid ultra trendy places like an ex boyfriend but I love Postino  It used to be an old post office thus the name  It is now a wine bar that serves light fare  There are not too many places with this kind of atmosphere in the Valley  very California  One of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open  Little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices  The bathrooms are lovely clean and lit by candles  The salads are my favorite in Phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world   Come early get your table and enjoy
5,Im usually not a big buffet fan but this place changed my mind  Its very clean good service lots and lots of amazing dishes AND really good sushi  Weekend lunch was 1499 but during the week its 1199 Well worth every penny One more comment this isnt the kind of buffet where shifty people go The kind where you need to Purell your hands and arms when you get back to the table  
5,This review is directly for Joe that works at this specific location From the first time I entered the store with my boyfriend I cant explain how much of a help Joe has been Not only is he knowledgeable about every product in the store his warm character makes it an absolute pleasure to shop there If it were up to me Joe would be a regional manager
5,"I am not religious but I will be the first person to admit I thank God for this placeand the neighboring Windsor Seriously a latte ice cream on a waffle cone and a cocktail all within feet of each other Dear Lord I have reached bliss I can die happy now

Some people gripe that the flavors are not strong enough 
I prefer to gripe that they arent open 247 because this is my bliss and damn it I need it at all hours

Always friendly
Always clean
Always awesome

Yes there is heaven"
5,"One two Feddys coming for you Three four better lock your door Five six pick up a crucifix Seven eight better stay up late Nine ten if Freddy Kruger went to Lush hed have had great skin

Dude this place is AMAZING All of their products are all natural freshly made without preservatives and are just incredible  My best friend and  went here after a four martini lunch plus shopping and we had a had treatment done with their Ocean Salt Cleaner and exfoliator  It is made with sea salt and smells just like a margarita  his was followed by using their dream cream and now I am hooked  And its not just the martinis  I have very sensitive skin and I have never had a reaction  They also have a great mens line as well  I have been using the Ambrosia Shaving Cream for men as well on my face and I have no razor burn  It is like a light cream that moisturizes while I shave  Wow  I have never felt good after a shave

Anyway I could gush all day about this place but the bottom line is it has incredible products that are all natural and many are vegan  the staff is amazingly helpful and not at all phony and even though it may seem expensive the products last for a long time so the cost is really not that high  Get thee to Lush"
5,"I did not expect such a great find in a such a nondescript location I went there looking for a very odd beer Not only did they have it they had tons of it The guy behind the counter was helpful as soon as I walked in and showed me exactly what I needed

They know what they sell very well and can give excellent recommendations on whatever you might be looking for It was great to talk shop with someone who obviously knew his stuff"
5,"I crave breakfast food all the time but I want something more than an Ihop or Dennys Not only is Crackers  Co way better than a mainstream breakfast place its actually cheaper too

I ordered the breakfast burrito without meat and it was amazing It had just the right amount of spice and the portions were way bigger than I imagined Their country potatoes are awesome and have nice brown crunchy edges I went with a group of 5 people who all ordered different breakfast items and not a single person was disappointed with their food

This place was not only really cute but also great for the price and taste Plus they serve breakfast all day on Fridays Saturdays and Sundays
I cant wait to go back"
5,Nearly 3 years after a Waikiki vacation my longing for a Puka dog has been satisfied Maui Dog is not exactly the same nor should it be but it has the same awesome concept plus more Ive been here twice once had a beef dog the other a turkey dog Both with mild garlic mayo  pineapple These suckers are huge And messy And delicious The dog has good flavor mixed with the slightly sweet bun spicy mayo and sweet pineappleperfect I think it would have been a better eating experience if my order was not togo The mess these things make all wrapped up is not pretty but that absolutely does not deter from the taste I cant wait till I have the time to eatin and try the rest of their tastysounding menu
1,"I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought Id scout out some LFS while I was visiting which led me to Reef Culture At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use however this soon changed

 On closer inspection lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down When I did manage to get their attention I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon to tiny DIY LED picos 

After this rude and demeaning experience I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down snapped his fingers at me and told me to stop harassing the fish Keep in mind I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was much less reach to harass any fish After this rude treatment I promptly left This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too 

I wont be doing business here when I move"
1,Very bad food
5,I love this place Im mostly here at dinner time to pick up my favorite roasted turkey artichoke panini and sometimes salad and soup as well The staff is super friendly and recognize when my boyfriend and I show up maybe because he can never leave without getting a dozen of their amazing cookies The manager Kaylee is fabulous she makes us feel right at home and is never unsatisfactory They may have a smaller parking lot but I guess I have always had good luck with finding a spot I know I will continue to come back for more
5,"i dont know why i didnt fall in love with pita jungle sooner 

i work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week 

i ordered a standard gyro with no pickles they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting 
my coworker jen ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top 

mine was delicious and i tasted hers hers was so good i was like thats what im ordering tomorrow

the next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita

the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio 

and the trend continued their food is so good and its like 8 and since i work nearby i get a discount 

today i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms i watched them steam them then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic red wine and seasoning some of the best mushrooms ive ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms


i love this place"
5,"MEOW This place is great  super clean loaded with an amazing assortment of natural foods for both pooches and kitties and two fridges jammed full with raw diet selections  My fourfooted kids were in heaven going through the bags

Not wanting to offend anyone in my bunch its impossible to travel anywhere with three dogs and two cats while simultaneously maintaining any level of decorum I went solo this weekend to support the latest AzRESCUE effort being sponsored by the store In addition to them sending me home with a complimentary Yoghund for each of the kids I got some great insight to private training that my youngest is in desperate need of if he ever hopes to be socially acceptable and some great toys for the felines The staff was unbelievably nice they have some truly unique items and the prices range from wow thats pretty cheap to OMG do I dare

This is a great option to the chains and big box stores so grab your leash wag that tail and pad your way on down to the Noble Beast"
5,"I really Love this place
I stopped in for lunch and tried a couple new things 

The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer see pics which is
roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan brown butter
sage and crumbled amarettiOMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share  its available in two sizes I got the small one
The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch

I ordered the Healthy Fish again see pics and once again it was perfect

My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia see pics which had Italian sausage caramelized onions and pecorino cheese The sausage was really good and for just 5 you cant beat that"
1,I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum  My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva  but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them I hope they get it  that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back
5,"Lees is the best privately owned ice cream parlor in Scottsdale Located in Old Town Scottsdale in the heart of some prime dining locations Lees is a great night cap in the form of ice cream a superb place to bring a date or all in all just a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy some ice cream con alcohol 

Lets start with the aesthetics Lees offers a very clean small cozy environment  A few table and chair sets dot the inside and a couple more to match on the outside Lee has some awesome glass vases on the wall that add a modern touch She has a few large clocks with different time zones so you know what time it is on the east coast while you eat I dunno the clocks were kind of a head scratcher

The Service is spectacular Lee is the only help Ive ever received there so I am not sure if she works alone or has help She is always timely and prompt to greet and serve you and automatically starts you off with TWO samples of which ever flavors you would like All the young ones like myself be prepared to show ID although you would have to eat a lot of ice cream to get loaded Lee doesnt skimp on the booze either Lee is usually a bit on the quiet side so you gotta listen up and be as patient with her as she is with you The lady is running the joint by herself 

The Product is what makes Lees so good Her ice cream flavors are inventive and wonderful There is usually new options as well a few solid customer favorites too choose from As prementioned Lee does pack a fair amount of liquor in her ice cream so some of the flavors have a stronger alcohol flavor than others The Jack Daniels chocolate swirl is my personal favorite and has the perfect amount of bourbon to chocolate ratio to make a unique delectable treat Lee does offer nonalcoholic flavors at a discounted price too for those opt to take there alcohol and ice cream separate The cookie dough flavor may be the best ice cream I have tried with or without booze"
5,Juan Jaimes is where the simple taste of Mexico are served with delectable results  The kitchen produces vibrant fiesta flavors that left me wanting more The simple menu offers approachable exciting delicious food that satisfies any appetite  The Margaritas flavor should be praised And the staff is top notch  This is just what Chandler needed  If you go ask for the Grilled Mahi Mahi  Youll thank me later  I cant wait to go back
5,Coffee talk is a nice surprise nestled in the hum drum downtown of Mesa I have been enjoying their coffee and live talent since I was fifteen When I was in High School it was a ritual to hit the local dollar movie and then end the night with some coffee at coffee talk I think the best part was hitting on boys and trying to pass as being at least eighteen years old My reasons for going to Coffee Talk have changed over the past decade but the atmosphere and quality drinks and pastries have not changed There is nothing better than sitting on their back patio and enjoying the cool breeze of the fall There is something about that place that brings me a sense of relaxation If you enjoy artistic ambiance coffee and live performances then I would recommend Coffee Talk
1,Horrible I had a gel manicure The tech didnt let my old gel soak off long enough so she scraped clipped and filed so hard to get it off that it left my natural nail extremely thin and flimsy The new polish that was put on was thick in some areas and thinner in others I didnt realize it until I got home I grabbed my purse and almost broke my naturally long nails because they were so frail I get the gel manicure because it has a thicker finish and makes my nails firmer I called and told them about what happened The gentleman who answered the phone told me that I was wrong and that they would not refund my money I will never go back and I am sure sorry I ever did in the first place
1,"We were excited to check out this new restaurant We were left extremely underwhelmed We sat in the bar to watch MNF It would have been nice to be able to hear the game over the discordant pop rock music at a mexican establishment but I understand that you are not a sports bar It was Monday night and with the exception of a large group  of blue hairs celebrating secretarys day the place was empty  The bar area managed to fill up because the Cardinals were on tv and it seemed as thought the high tops and patio were busy as well 

Our bartender Amanda was very polite and eager to up sell us their flavored tequilas and specialty cocktails You can tell she was a little wet behind the ears but she was doing her best nothing a little training and experience cant fix The wait time to receive a cocktail was excruciatingly long though being a former bartender I understand the complexity that new bars go though to develop new and unique cocktails  We ordered the pumpkin margarita I applaud the attempt but personally it tasted like puréed baby food 

I was feeling very open minded and wanted to experience as much as I could that TQLA had to offer so we ordered the salsa trio and chicken tortilla soup  

Queso dip cold
Habanero dip sweet with a swift kick afterwards not bad
Guacamole good but was gone after 2 bites I guess they feel if they place the guacamole on a bed of green shredded lettuce it will look like there is more than delivered Fail

Chicken tortilla soup Thick tomato soup with dry dark meat chicken chunks Maybe it is just me but I prefer a more broth based ck tort soup and juicy whitedark meat chicken Bleh Amanda offered to remove it off our bill but I insisted on finishing mine because I was hungry My GF pushed hers to the side DNF 

Meanwhile whilst experience our starters we managed without any silverware or napkins and at this point Amanda being the only bartender on managed to become flooded with specialty cocktails in the well thus not being able to properly oversee her patrons at the bar Needles to say our drinks were empty our plates monkey dishes empty bowl of chips 2 cups of bland tortilla soup saucers and wrinkled up black beverage napkins used in the place of the real ones were all tattering on the edge of the bar eagerly anticipating a bus boy to remove them 

Onto the Entrees

I ordered the carne Asada steak  My girlfriend tried the habanero chicken platter They were delivered by TQLA manager Joe Whom decidedly pulled himself from enjoying the football game to expedite some food He crept up behind us and shuffled the entree platters in front of our faces after we spread our dirty dishes closer to the edge of the bar and politely stacked them for our ficticious busboygirl to remove them properly Now in my history with management a decent manager would offer to remove the collection of dishes but instead he decided to ask us if we needed anything else since the look on our faces was disgust Instead we opted to inform Joe that we would enjoy our meal a little better with silverware and napkins  He acknowledged that was a novel concept and proceeded to fetch us a pair Joe wasnt six steps away before he was interrupted by a member of the waitstaff who informed him that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some first time customers so they could enjoy their ever increasingly cold food  At this point my girlfriends temper got the best of her and she jumped up and retrieved her own silverware off of a table in front of Joe and eager waitress to salvage any heat that might have been left in our entrees 

We dig in  

Carne Asada was tender but lacking the Wow factor 

Habanero Chicken Tasted like a chicken breast smothered in their warm fire roasted salsa What happened to the habaneros  Where is the heat Bland

I hope they get better but until then Nandos all the way Never saw Joe touch any tables never offered to help out a bartender who was swimming laps in an Olympic size pool Occasionally the wait staff would come behind the bar and help out  This is about the time that our appetizers chips soups and entrees were all removed from the bartop FYI Joe the hostess stand can hold itself up on its own You dont have to stand there and hold it up Keep an eye on your staff and customers and offer help where they need it so people will be happy to come back and give you a second shot"
5,Amazing I crave see on a daily basis They are absolutely delicious its weird they are like cupcakes from heaven Sure 350 is a little pricey but they truly are the best cupcakes Ive ever had Everyone there is always so nice and friendly my only complaint is I wish they had one closer to my house Get the red velvetyou wont be sorry The lemon cinnamon sugar and peanut butter chocolate chip are also very good Yum
5,I cannot say enough about how much I LOVE We Care Family Wellness Center I refer everyone I know to them Dr Ross Cheryl and everyone on staff are truly wonderful They genuinely care about you as a person and always make you feel like you are the only patient on the planet whenever they are with you They are never rushed and will take all the time in the world to listen to you and figure out whats going on with you After having seen more doctors than I care to remember I feel so blessed that I have found such amazing healthcare providers
5,I have been going to Elite Nails for two years and they have always been wonderful  People see my nails and always ask where I go  I highly recommend
5,"I had such a great experience with Love Carpet Care and Repair They were friendly and courteous and enthusiastic every time I spoke to them on the phone and their work was incredible  

I hired them to clean a carpet in an apartment  The leasing office at the apt complex told me the carpet was in such bad shape they would have to trash it  Quick aside I did not live in the apartment but I was responsible for the damage  Love Carpet Care did such a good job cleaning the carpet it looked nearly new again  Truly outstanding  

And most importantly the price they quoted me beforehand  when I gave them an honest account of the condition and size  was the final price  Love it  And it was cheap  I was desperate and upset enough that they really could have charged me anything but they were wonderful  Honest hardworking helpful

I could never say enough good things about this company"
5,Let me start off by saying that there are several Slices restaurants in the Valley The one on Mill is by far the best They have the most amazing and original selection of pizza  No matter what you pick it will be good  If your favorite isnt available when you walk in no problem They will make it for you If you are looking for a slice of heaven you MUST try the salad pizza  No its not lettuce on crust  It is simply the most unbelievable creation that includes artichokes red pepper and spinach  It is great by itself but ask for them to put balsamic dressing on top  The balsamic takes it from being amazing to last meal quality 
5,Very authentic excellent Thai food and soothing ambience And they have delivery My favorites are the Fried Shrimp Rolls Egg Rolls Clear Noodle Soup Pad Thai Chicken PhadSeeEw Beef Papaya Salad etc I love the Sweet Rice with Thai Custard It tastes exactly like the Filipino custard I grew up with
5,Delicious sandwiches its so worth the drive i just wish it was closer to home so we could eat there more My hubby brought me a sandwich home a couple weeks ago and it wasnt the same it was too soggy so id prefer to eat there The regular ham with added bacon is the best
5,I just purchased a new Sorento here and my experience was amazing Mike Bergesson was super easy to work with and got me a great deal I live 50 miles away and there are 4 closer Kia dealerships but I would do business with Salazar Kia over the others any day Thanks
1,Their alcohol slushies are undrinkable and are sure case of gut rot As far as the place its pretty small youll probably want to leave after 10 minutes
5,"I have been coming to this place for atleast 5 years This is a favorite of my friends whole family 

This place is so very consistent They always have the same good things If youre looking for buffet variety this is not the place 

Everyone is so very nice This place has been open for 30 years for good reason I have never ordered from their menu because their buffet is so good 

Go and try not to get hooked 

Enjoy"
5,"i stopped by here on a lunch break because the sign said appraisals by appointment the owner  indra was there and willing to do the appraisal on my engagement ring while i waited without an appointment  yay he cleaned my ring at no charge inspected it and provided the retail value at no charge indra told me a written appraisal for insurance purposes is only 45  a bargain compared to what others in the valley are charging the stock of jewelry was lovely  a nice mix of new and used pieces some very unique one of a kind finds as well i found a few things i would prefer not to live without 

they do all their own importing and buy sell and trade jewelry i felt he was very honest about my ring the cash value he stated was in line with numbers i heard from other jewelers and he was charming and helpful answering questions and educating me while i ogled over diamonds and pearls i will return to have my watch batteries replaced a pair of earrings changed from yellow to white gold and pretty much anything else i can think of i trusted him immediately which when dealing with diamonds is of paramount importance to me"
5,"Heaven Fuego is just heaven This super small yet charming place is our favorite The menu is unique and delish The creamed corn is to die for I am talking unbelievable 
Thirsty Their mojito selection is insane and they have an even better happy hour 
Only negative is that because of its small size it fills up fast reservations are a must"
1,whole foods whole paycheck wholly sht i am sorry there prices are rediculous the only reason i went there is because since moving here from a very foody town certain products are nearly impossible to find and they do have them but you will pay my search today was mushroms not button but chantreloysterect i was going to get every thing on my list but when i saw shallots at 495 a lb i bought my shrooms and split the i hit frys shallots 249 a lb and of course theres always trader joes
5,"I have been going to Meshas Salon and Spa for the past 5 years and absolutley love it I see Michelle the owner and she comes up with some great new looks for me 
I have gone from short hair funky styles and colors and long and sexy hair She is awesome and I love her recommendations There have been times I have gone in and not knowing what to do and she always comes up with something that makes me feel fabulous 
I will never go anywhere else"
5,"had a great time here the other day  the food was delicious and the staff was just as wonderful

i cant wait to come back here and try out more of their dishes"
5,"I do not understand less than four stars We had six different plates Beet Salad Rabit ButterScallopsStrawberry desert and Peach desert  All were brilliant Our favorite both agreed was the Beet Salad It was so fresh and had a perfect combo of flavors and textures 

Service was way more than perfect One note they are now BYOB with a corkage fee for Beer and Wine No fee if the Beer or Wine is from Arizona

One note for FnB we were preplexed with the lack of pork on the menu "
5,Good micro brew made right there Food is good as well
1,So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place I would support the first amendment with my wallet Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside We were literally outnumbered by the people working there I say this because somehow despite this fact the service was HORRENDOUS I mean we got our order out fine but our waitress dissappeared after that At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was The Philadelphia roll was decent but the California roll was really bad When it came to paying I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table the waitress didnt return If it wasnt for the cash I had on me Id be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again
5,"Let me start off by saying that if there were 6 stars Id give this place 6 stars

Last Chance is simply amazing but only to those true bargain shopaholics There are days when the store will be flourishing with dreamlike items fluttering all over the place waiting to be picked up and finding a new home in your closet Other times you must dig deep and then come out with a diamond in the rut

I visited Last Chance today and fell in love all over again I got a BCBG dress three name brand tees two casual dresses eight hair bands a adorable pair of earrings FIVE purses and a pair of lace leggings for 3900 And they all still had the Nordstrom tag on it

They had so many things on sale in addition to their already low prices To truely love Last Chance you must have an open mind and realize that this is not your typical department store therefore it will not operate like one so get over the kids crowds and messes its Nordstrom stuff at below yardsale prices You must also be fashion and brand savvy

Uhh Darn diggity goodness mother of Betunia McGrittles these scary looking boots with a devil pointy edge are 2999 and they look like they have been tried on oh fooey pooey that is just too garsh darn expensive Gurtude And someone wrote their name Jimmy Choo on it Uhh why are there so many  people ALL over the place and grabbing shoes like crazy making a mess Oh goodness heaven no this store is horrible Just like that Juicy Couture jumpsuit for 999 a piece up front oh no another child making a mess lets get out of here and go to Sears or JC Penny they have such great elastic pants grandma jeans and they never have a mess there I do not see why people like this place darn diggity Random Last Chance nonenthusiast

Key point if youre not into brands and fashion and are not creative and a bargain shopper lover then you will not appreciate this beautiful place we are so lucky to have in Phoenix 

Last Chance tips
All Last Chancers will put a  hit on me after this but I love my fellow yelpers oh so much lol

Arrive EARLY Anytime after noon all the goods will most likey be gone and all the damagedugly stuff will be left 

WATCH YOUR CART People will take you 2500 pair of Coach wedges lol

Dont make eye contact with anyone Dont trust anyone If you see a pair of Seven jeans for 1499 DESCRETELY grab them and move on Any sense of alert will beckon a herd of jean hungry woman and you will get mobbed

Move QUICKLY if you have to RUN Especially if you are there right when they open set your mind to what you want and RUN to that department This will assure first dibs on the that sections finest

Dont start crap with ANYONE It can get really ugly and there is a wall of pictures of banned people from Last Chance and that is no where you want to end up in for ANYONE

The rest of the tips are too super insider to say aloud sorry huns but I will spill one super Last Chancer tipHappy shopping muaaah 

Look in the size 1011 in woman shoes thats where all the BEST shoes are hidden  or stashed by other people who will be back later that day or had to go to the bathroom upstairs and didnt have anyone to hold their shoes No woman really wears those sizes so they figure to just stash them there for a few minutes I cannot begin to describe the designer glories I have discovered stuffed behind a size 11 pair of Pumas


NOTE TO EVERYONE OVERALL PLEASE BE NICE AND SHARE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GO THERE JUST TO FIND DEALS AND RESELL THEM ON EBAY AND THEY CAN BE JUST PLAIN MEAN REMEMBER WE ARE ALL HUMAN AND MUST BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER NO CURSING SHOVING ECT LETS MAKE LAST CHANCE A NICE PLACE TO SHOP AND END THE VIOLENCE AND ANGER OVER CLOTHESPURSESSHOES ECT WE CANNOT SELL OUR SOULS TO THEM TAKE CARE EVERYONE "
1,"Great food can be found anywhere Great service is one in a million these days This place gets an A in the most awful service I have ever received and if you havehad a Groupon for this place like I did dont even bother going Youll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day

Its simple Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon LivingSocial etc to garner new and potential repeat customers Instead after going there with my handy coupon I cant help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received 

I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole prime rib We sit down am impressed with the old school decor and then the server from Azkaban appears We tell her that wed like to order off the special evening menu where its a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that its our first time Wrong thing to do I dont know if its because past Grouponers dont tip well or something but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant 

It took our food the chicken and prime rib almost 33 minutes to come out All we did was nom  and nom  and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver which isnt to blame since I was never a liver fan Not once did our server come by our table We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasnt her fault and theres no use in calling her out for nothing We asked if she knew where our server was and she said she would look for her 10 minutes later nothing yet it was the new server who kept coming back asking if everything was alright like a normal server should 

Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored 17 minutes pass no check came even though our  table had been cleared Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didnt even want to see her face so another random server brought it back

We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our nonexistent server was treating us like crap We didnt even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave but whether they did or not I didnt even care at that point 

To be honest I cant even remember what the food tasted like which isnt quite fair in a review I went here a couple of months ago but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food Im pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did

Maybe it wasnt even the Groupon Who knows All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it"
5,Ive been really impressed with John Skiba and his professionalism He is always up to date on everything in bankruptcy law and Ive enjoyed reading his blog posts It really shows his expertise and passion for what he does Hopefully I will never need his services but if I ever were to need an Arizona bankruptcy attorney I would go to him first for sure
1,"My fiance and I tried the place because of a Groupon  We live in the same neighborhood and see the place all the time but the look of the place was never enough to draw us in  There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all  Its in a strip mall and looks old  At night they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung

When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor no host station and no host  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasnt a bar that Id want to eat drink and socialize at  To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was  Im already hereI dont need any more persuasion  Its time for the Chefowner to take down the look how good I was trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look

We were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor  He handed us our menus and asked if he could get us something to drink  There is no drink menu on the menu  No beer list no soda list no liquid period  We asked to see the wine list which had only bottle prices and doesnt even hint that they sell wine by the glass  Once I asked if they had beer and sold wine by the glass it was like we made a breakthrough   The menu seems a bit outdated so I  went with the Lasagna the basics  While we sat waiting for our meal the salads came  Weirdthe menu didnt mention anything about a salad nor did the waiter   More lack of information from the menu

Now on to the decor  It is terribly outdated  Tacky bland pale paint scheme brass fixtures mirrors and cliche wine bottles  There were beautiful fresh flowers throughout which we really enjoyed  I was unfortunately seated directly in front of two paintings both with a woman and a little girl drinking what appears to be wine  Im guessing they are personal family paintings but they are horribly out of place and bordering on creepy  I couldnt take my eyes off of them and that distracted me throughout the night  This place needs a makeover new modern paint scheme and some updating on the artwork

The lasagna came  It was OK at best  I tried my fiances chicken genevese at it was horrible  The chicken tasted like it was boiled which is an instant dish killer for me  We did not take our leftovers  We asked for the check and it came with a after dinner cordial which was a nice surprise and tasted delicious 

We wont be back  To be honest Oreganos lasagna is better by far"
1,Total bait and switch sales department Will tell you one price over the phone then quote you another when you arrive Happened to me personally 3 times I bought from Scottsdale BMW One quote one price done deal Buyer beware
5,"I dined here last week with my wife and inlaws and I gotta say it doesnt get much better  Ambiance was dark but classy  Loved the music no dated Rat Pack stuff here  Started the evening with their amazing Trio of Duck Fat Fries  The truffle emulsion may have been the best sauce Ive ever had in my life  Only got better from there Shellfish tower was loaded with goodies and all tasted straight from the ocean  For entrees my wife got the Trio of Kobe Beef and I had the Fried Chicken for two  One of the top meals Ive ever had in my life  The chicken was so moist an came with a truffle mac  cheese and onion jus  I did say it was for two but it was so good that i refused to share  My wife couldnt stop talking about the Kobe Trio  

But I gotta say the best part of the experience was the staff  Knowledgeable just isnt enough to describe the service here  They care about every single detail never missing one  The Sommelier made excellent wine recommendations and each one well within my price range and never skipped a beat when it came to pouring for the table  The server was as professional as professional gets and the Manager seemed to always be there to pull out a chair or provide a fresh napkin  Flawless

Well done Bourbon Steak"
5,Love love love this place Seriously a place in Phoenix that is locally owned has great prices great food and buys local is pretty hard to find My favorite wrap is the Gardinn salad as a wrap My only complaints about this place are the hours and the parking But still well worth it
5,"I rarely give 5 stars as I believe it is very difficult to obtain a perfect score through food beverage service ambiance etc Christophers new venture is perfectly Christopher 5 stars

First off a little background Christopher is a native Thats right hes a graduate of Central High School He studied in France where he honed his craft and to this day draws his technique from He has owned now three ventures in Phoenix first his fine dining and bistro location on the northwest corner of 24st and Camelback later became Eddies by Eddie Matney former hair dresser turned chef at CousCous then Eddies Grill then after closing he moved to the restaurant row in The Biltmore Fashion Park 2rd level to open Christophers Fermier Brasserie  Paolas Wine Bar Which in reading many reviews here on Yelp was unfortunately misunderstood It makes me wonder if people understand what French is its not their fault though there arent many French restaurants in town most have be closed including Mary Elaines at the Phoenician  and John Claudes Petite Cafe There are a few that still survive Sophies and Vincents but in this town of chains few people venture for French Now with Christophers RestaurantCrush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead Christopher does enjoy lounges as he is a regular at Merc Bar but then so is his smoked salmon which is offered on the Merc Bar menu So a lounge makes sense Im a believer in a chef should open what they are passionate about 

The new location has a different feel from his previous his last venture echoed a French Countryside feel as did the food I think that was why many didnt understand it yes it was French but ALL FRENCH IS NOT FINE DINNING I wish more understood that concept but this is primarily a beer drinking state not wine or rather more Mc Ds not Mary Es Hence theres a difference between filling your stomach and filling your soul and leaving a restaurant inspired with the feeling that life is wonderful Christophers is the latter 

The design is contemporary with long lines of brushed stainless white linen and exposed wooden beams Kudos to whoever designed it great job The tables are dressed with white linen elegant silver and polished stemware You cant help but feel that its time to dine when seated The walls in the main dining room have many vases of fresh flowers that seem to be replaced whenever necessary nice touch  

The food at Christophers is exactly what youd expect French without the superhighend prices Hes still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice wine is added Ive been there now on 4 occasions and everything is fantastic flavorful and prepared professionally Christopher offers daily specials and I recommend them including Veal Chop on Wednesdays Roasted Duck on Thursday Lamb Shank on Friday and Rabbit on Saturday But dont stop at your entree get the cheese course for dessert or for something sweet the Chocolate Tower is one of the best desserts in town hands down no question  

Service is another point were Christopher sets himself apart It doesnt get any better than this Again its NOT fine dining so you cant compare it to fine dining restaurants but then again theres only one left in the valley  Different Point Of View  The servers know the food they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it if you know Christopher it probably is  Food is coursed correctly with a few minutes in between as well as wine service is as professional as it gets The bread service is as always French breads with a super rich euro butter perfect for lapping up to sauce or vinaigrette remains on your plate

Needless to say Christopher does it right in my opinion or is it just my opinion Many of the valleys most celebrated chefs eat at Christophers hes know in many circles as the chefs chef But dont take my word for it ask the chef at your favorite restaurant who their favorite chefs are in town and favorite restaurants most likely Christopher will make the list

5,Hands down best slices in Scottsdale
1,Just dont
5,My wife and I ate here last night and were extremly happy We started with drinks at the bar which started the night out perfectlly then we had an appetizaer which was a tower of cheese  a sculpture of grilled cheese like the hard grilled cheese on the sides of a grilled cheese sandwich I had the tacos they may be small but they were packed by taste My wife had the fish of the day and that day it was halibut my wife said it was the best fish she ever had The service was great overall a great smalll place to eat
5,Culvers is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out I believe they have several stores now here in the valley The Root Beer is a must as well as the Butter Burgers Cheese curds Frys Frozen custurdlol the list goes on I have not found anything as of yet that I did not enjoy
5,The scenery was amazing Wooooooooo  Well thats my biggest impression of this place If youre looking for a great place to golf i suggest you swing by this place They give you 5 stars customer service and making sure that youre having the best time of your life
5,"AAAAMAZING
They have the best hot dogs and corn dogs i have ever had  It is definitely a place to try if you love hot dogs
They have good fries excellent onion rings and very very reasonable prices  I have never met a single person who has said anything but incredible things about Teds definitely a must try"
5,WOW  From service to food 5 stars    Went here last night for our 10th anniversary   They never cease to amaze us   Husband had a Caesar salad Rib Eye with crab legs and I had a salad with Balsamic Vinagrette  Salmon with Asian glaze with a carrott and swiss chard medley  Amazing   Perfection  Kyle served us we were impressed by his knowledge of the menu and attention to detail    Everyone we came in contact with was pleasant  If only more restaurants treated their patrons this way  If you have their VIP card you also earn points which convert into  you can use towards a future visit    Thanks Kyle and McCormick and Schmicks
5,"Just as good a Pizzeria Bianco But with the added bonus of not having to wait for hours and hours Granted there may still be a wait here but you arent fighting tourist for tables at this joint Its more of a local fav 

Fresh gourmet toppings and very good crust Personally a big fan of the garden seating There was a longer than normal wait for the food however the server was very attentive and I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance as we had drinks in garden I would not recommend this place for a quick meal but its perfect if you bring friends and want to have time to relax and enjoy conversation"
5,"Try the Larb it is on happy hour and it even comes in tofu as a veggie option This one dish alone 5 at happy hour would make me love this place but there were many more delights that made my visit so great

I dont drink with dinner but here it was happy hour all day sat and they had a unique drink the Curry Gimlet IT comes in a martini glass has a orange hue it is fruity but has a curry finish from cardamom I assume truly unique

Our dishes of Pad See ewe and Dragon noodles were great and huge portions   Rich flavors well textured tofu and crisp veggies 

When I made my reservation I let them know about the birthday of the person I was with We were surprised with fried banana and ice cream along with a candle and signing it was great"
5,"Um YAY  Picture a girl hanging with her lovely on a Monday afternoon after what could be politely described as a terrible week before looking to soothe her spirit with some lovely food and atmosphere the company was already delightful I saw a piece in the local rag about C4 and since were already in Moon Valley I say how bout it Jeff agrees and were off  

We arrived just before 4  closing time and the bartenderwaitperson was reeeeally nice She told us we had only a few minutes to order because the kitchen would be closing and that the pizza oven was already off No worries we remain unfazed We sat at a high top next to the bar there were a few other people at tables nearby some drinking coffee and one couple enjoying the bruschetta and some wine on a leather sofa by the large fireplace The room hits just the right notes for me warm and inviting nice art but not overpowering  its a place I could hang out in We both had a nice glass generous pour of a Voga Pinot Gris and a sandwich I had smoked salmon Jeff had roast beef The smoked salmon was a generous portion with capers cuke and tomato and a what seemed to be a seasoned mayo not goat cheese as the online menu suggests but a nice and savory compliment just the same on a toasted baguette Roast beef was similar in scale lots of meat with melted cheddar greens also on a toasted baguette Each was served with a side of chips and a pickle 

It may have been me or just the mood I was in but I really felt relaxed there and in spite of the fact that we closed the place for the afternoon we didnt feel rushed or in the way It was just a nice shoulder dropping ahhhh experience Not the spa but just what the doctor ordered 

Serious yay total digdom We wanted to plant a place just like it of our own on the beach in Mauiits nice to dreamTotally worth the trip we will be back"
5,"Best and most helpful hardware store I have visited Thank God I live almost across the street

After many many home projects and recently rebuilding my kitchen I have frequented this Ace almost more times than I should But I am always pleased at how quickly and smoothly my searches at this Ace are

Try it youll like it"
1,What ever you do dont waste your money here  I am not the person who likes to send food back in fact I hate to do it  I had no choice here this was by far the worst mexican food I have eaten  The food has such a horrible after taste  I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible  The service compares to the food we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us  I wouldnt even recommend this place to my enemies
5,"I woke up this morning craving a breakfast burrito Fortunately just 3 days ago a menu was left on our door for Ciscos Grill with some great marketing I might add Conveniently located right up the street from my house Ive been curious about this place since they opened I strapped on my shoes and walked on over upon entering I was greeted cordially and placed my order for a chorizo and egg burrito with cheese The cook went to work and 5 minutes later I was holding a fresh hot burrito and a complimentary pineapple water Cisco came out and introduced himself while I was waiting and chatted with me for a few minutes Its clear to me that hes very passionate about his restaurant The service is top notch

The menu itself is fairly generic typical burger and fries tacos and burritos but everything is so fresh and prepared well Id recommend this joint to anyone looking for a quick inexpensive bite to eat"
5,"I walked in and uttered I think I found my new home

1 Miller High Life on draught and bottle
2 Buckhunt the lil orange gun has even been taped togetherdouble buck bonus
3 Bowling videogamegod I love these things
4 Indoor smoking lounge With a large screen TV two tables and a lot of pleather seating the large fan wont mean much but WOWexciting There is a french style door separating the lounge from the bar area where the stage is so you can still peak at the band while sucking tar
5 Welleven the womens bathroom is pretty gnarlywhich would normally subtract a starbut I was so happy to pee in the unmarked restroom I wont touch it

Other notes all bartender barbacks security were extremely sweet and friendly all other patrons were either pretty chill excited to see the band that was playing or willing to strike up conversation tons of televisions everywhere they had a lot of beers on tapcheap too this place is HUGE In fact I would consider it a liability since there are a lot of steps connecting each sectionat times I found myself balancing precariouslyand that is bc I am a klutzwasnt even drunkok not that drunk Most everyone had tats black hair laid back This is def not a sceneand I love that"
5,I stayed at the hotel and I tried Tuscany and it was really good  Delicious Scallops and pasta  Also the pizza was excellent  The server was great and I would return to this restaurant when I visit the hotel again
5,"OK call me weird here but I liked the funky very Old School ambiance of MacAlpines when my fiance and I went there this past Sunday for the Studebaker and friends car show

Admittedly I was there once before ca 1999 and was NOT impressed but things have def improved IMHO

I had a Club sandwich and it was one of the best ones Ive ever had at least in recent years Would eat one again The chocolate milk shake was OK but could have used a tad more syrup but Id have one again"
5,My husband and I have eaten Chinese food all over Phoenix and hands down Big Wa has been the best  The BBQ pork with fresh spicy mustard is AMazing  We have ordered about 6 different dishes from here sometimes totally blind and the food is always great
5,"One bite and I was transported back to the crowded streets of Monterrey  I could almost smell the exhaust of the vochos and hear the distant conversation of the local policia extorting their prescribed mordida  Quite simply this is the taco as the way it was intended by its creators  The pure and unadulterated classic enjoyed by the Mexican working class

What Pomo is to pizza this place is to tacos  Authenticabsolutely authentic"
5,"Joes has long been one of our favorite restaurants in Gilbert  The pulled pork is excellent the sides are even better and the service is always friendly

Dont be intimidated by a long line even out the door as it moves fast  The cheesy potatoes and corn are great  The lemon cake is very moist and a nice finish to a meal

Be sure to stop by on your birthday and pick up a free meal

The kids love running around outside in the grassy area and always enjoy going to Joes"
5,Im sorry to say that they closed their doors for good just a few weeks ago
5,"I hardly ever give five star reviews My experience at Culinary Dropout today prompted me to do so The reason we checked this place out was because I had a 25 coupon from Fox RC for Labor Day First things first The employees are extremely good looking There is lots of tattoos and bare skin Our bartender was awesome He answered all our dumb questions with a smile and made some killer drinks I had the Bacon Infused Bloody Mary and my friend had the Acai Mojito I will be going back again to have that Bloody Mary It was SO good We started out with the homemade chips and onion dip and it was delicious We pretty much filled up on those before we got our meals I ordered the Havarti Burger my roommate got the chef salad and my other friend got the canneloni Everything was super good but it was too much food My burger melted in my mouth and I kept stealing bites of my friends salad So in a nutshell

 Great vibe
 Great food
 Great drinks
 Hot employees
 Clever menu titles
 Great experience"
5,I love this place look for the specials and the different events they always have going on Its a great spot in the Valley
5,Always great fast and consistent  The service is excellent the staff has worked there for years and is speedy to run around and refill drinks and clear dishes  Its nice to have the counter service so you dont have to wait to be waited onbecause if I am at the mall I am there for serious business  If you like a home grown grilled cheese and some tomato soup or a salmon Cesar salad or even a gourmet pizza this is the place  The brownie and the red velvet cake are hard to resist get both
5,I have long liked Tempe Maretplace since it has opened                                                 It is a good location lots of parking all around Since when live in the extreme heat it is a bit nice that it is outdoors              There is a major selection or stores restaurants and services here  My girlfriend likes it as well So it is a win win set up They are decorated really well and they have a multitude of events here Even a Barnes and Noblewhich bookstores are not that easy to come accross now days
5,yummy  you will love this place  I love to sit on the patio on a nice day and enjoy   the sangria is amazing  and lettuce wraps soooo great  give it a try
1,After bad experience I will never return  It is terrible since they didnt meet my expectation and the price is outrageous  The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth req 16 hours of preparation and it tasted like water  I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but cant even eat it  The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant  If your fellow Asians dont patronize the place it is  because your food did not meet our expectation  Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish  It is night and day
5,"Bike cabs beware Youve got nothing on this rig 

Tour de Tavern is a tribute to tipsy teamwork and a perfect way to host a unique group event As pedalers on their inaugural tour we enjoyed the celebrity treatment of cruising down the winding streets of Old Town Scottsdale as onlookers snapped photos and cheered us on

We rocked out to top 40 hits and by special request our Lonely Island favorites on their awesome sound system Our guides were flexible and let our party run the show If we needed more time for lets say an impromptu horseback ride in front of Shotgun Bettys they were more than happy to wait 

As an added bonus everyone gets to burn off some of those unwanted cocktail calories in between your favorite watering holes If you are concerned that after a few stops and a few shots your legs might lose some of that forward momentum there are a few coveted non pedaling seats in the back of the bike We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system 

Our tour guides were helpful accommodating and entertaining They even proved to be exceedingly patient upon discovering that we did in facts have that guy in our group 

If youre saying to yourself  Such a marvelous experience could only cost an arm and least the majority of a leg then you would be wrong With the cost of gas being substituted for sheer earth friendly man power our group of fifteen people spent less than 30 bucks each for the experience

But wait theres more Included in this price are all the amazing special deals that Tour de Tavern exclusively brings you at select bars along the route On our tour we were offered drinks specials ranging from 3 to ONE PENNY  I say this in all caps because its ONE PENNY

So next time you are planning an event I recommend Tour de Tavern 100

Look Ma No hands"
1,Was in town for a business meeting and tried to catch a movie with a friend First impression of the place was that it needed a total make over  I mean TOTAL MAKEOVER Walked up to buy my ticket and the lady was a total jerk She had no idea when the movie times were and she clearly thought we were stupid She messed up our change and didnt believe us when we told her When we walked in they ripped the tickets out of our hands  When it came time to order our food the butter on the popcorn tasted like cough syrup The theater was extremely dirty and kids were screaming throughout the movie  After the movie I politely told the manager about our horrible experience  He was not understanding at all and even threatened to kick us out I was appaled by this whole endeavor and that is why I am writing this review It was a complete waste of time and money and I recommend everyone to stay away
5,Costco Travel  My husband and I recently returned from a trip to the Big Island HI that we arranged throught Costco Travel After shopping around I found that their prices were the best and after one phone call I was able to make all arrangements for airfair condo and car They didnt have arrangements with any BBs on Hilo but were able to adjust our travel dates Everything went according to plan with all arrangements being accurate Condo was outstanding and a great value We got gas and did some souvenier shopping at the Costco in Kona and again saved    Ive shopped at Costco for years  now becoming a groupie
5,"I joined a friend for a two hour evening ride at CCO We were the only two riders may be because it was a Sunday eve and all the tourists were drinking their mimosas by their hotel pools
The horses looked very well taken care of Mine was 17 year old Sundance a beautiful brown male Ive never ridden before and he was easy to control Our guide Ed was patient funny and awesome company He showed me the basics and was always there with a word of encouragement and a tip or two
Tip for the guys if you plan to trot wear tight jeans you will be thankful at the end of the day The city slicker that I am
I left my phone in my shirt pocket ended up dropping it while on the ride and Ed helped us go look for it The desert sun set over the mountains and the sandstorm about 30 miles away all made this a very memorable evening
I highly recommend CCO"
5,"SIMPLY AMAZING  WE LOVE IT

My hubby and I stopped in one day after deciding NOT to go to NYPD 
They were next door and we thought lets try something new We have been there 3 times since You sit and the food comes by and you just grab what you want off the rotating bar ITS GREAT Especially if you can not decide what you want until seeing it We ate like King and Queen for 2000

They have simple pricing and it is affordable for a date or family"
1,Id have to disagree with the person who said this restaurant is dog friendly  I was told off by the owner because I had a little dog outside table and that was right after I finished paying for an overpriced breakfast dish and coffee  I went here before that on several occasions and many times my order was forgotten after payingand the staff is real unprofessional blasting music at nightclub volume at early breakfast and lunch times  Im a neighbor but will never go here again
5,"I have been going to Tishs studio for years now When it comes to choosing a studio to practice at the environment and the instructors are crucially important Hegel Yoga provides an incredible atmosphere to practice yoga and the variety of classes available leaves little to be desired

Great energy great instructors great studio"
5,DUDEwhere is the mangawhere are the card tables What the heck is this place doing selling comics This is outrageous  And why are you talking to me and trying to help me comic clerk Your job is to give me a huge sigh and exasperated look as if I asked you to perform surgery This being helpful and friendly is really bothering me You guys are just too weird I need to go back to Atomic
5,Best happy hour in north Scottsdale Get there early to beat the crowd Amazing cuisine and atmosphere
5,Love this lake Went paddle boarding a few weeks back here and had the best time Lake water is so clean you can almost see the bottom Highly recommend this lake if you love water sports and fishing 
5,This gym is great  I joined because it opened only about 3 minutes away from my house  I keep going back because every person who works there is so nice and greets you with a smile and a friendly hello  It is not intimidating at all which is a big step up from the LA Fitness that I used to go to  The staff gets to know you by name and most of the other members are quite friendly as well   The gym is open enough that you can do free weights on your own without bumping into anyone and there are always plenty of cardio machines available   Ive been going there for over a year and plan to continue doing so
5,All I have to say is get the California Club I live in the East Coast and I still crave for the sandwich I wish I had the chance to try other things on the menu The drivethru concept is pretty neat but there was a bit of a wait Guess you cant rush perfection
5,This is the BEST hit or miss bargain spot for everything I frequently find great deals on quality body care products be sure you know how to read the labels theres a lot of low quality products in the mix designer sun glasses shoes clothing housewares baby shower gifts pet gifts and guy gifts It seems I go at peak hours where lines are incredibly long I see it as a small price for Macys quality at a Walmart price
5,"A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the main menu Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better

7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi Add 2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere

Beers for as afforadable as 325 Sodas with free refills for 195

Can you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale I didnt think so"
5,Teds rules  Great chargrilled hot dogs killer onion rings and a great atmosphere all add up to a good old dogeatin experience
1,"Ill be charitable  this place sucks

I went there because a friend had exactly the piece of furniture I needed and he got his from Ikea   After wandering around the store forever I finally found the right department

The people working there were cold uncaring not helpful no concept of customer service  I left in disgust

Couple of days later I was in Cost Plus World Market  18th St  Camelback  Voila  I fould what I wanted  for close to the same price  the BIG difference  Warm smiles friendly people volunteered to go out of their way to help me  Felt like I was among longtime friends  They even delivered when they said they would

And no need to drive half way to tucson and back

Ikea  Dont be foolish  Cost Plus  Now theres a place that earned my repeat business"
5,Love this place Amazing Happy Hour Specials
5,Perfect place for a hot summer day  Amazing paletas  Friendly staff and fresh ingredients  Welcoming environment in downtown Chandler
5,"This is by far my favourite department store hands down I have had nothing but perfect experiences in this store without exception no matter what department Im in The shoe SAs will bend over backwards to help you find a specific shoe and the staff will even go so far as to send out handwritten thank you cards to your home address after you make a purchase  big or small Tim  Anthony in the shoe salon are fabulous beyond words 

I am not completely sure that I understand why people complain about the amount of merchandise on the floor or the lack of crowds in this store Frankly I would rather not be bombarded with merchandise and other people One of the things I love the most about Barneys is not only the prompt attention of SAs but the fact that they arent rushing around trying to help 35 people at once The SAs at Barneys are incredibly friendly and will stop to have an actual conversation regardless or whether you are purchasing something or not I have also never experienced a high pressure sale situation here

All in all Barneys is pricey and there is no getting around it But um so is Neimans and that place is a crock Anywhere that ONLY accepts American Express or their charge card and then treats you like scum if you arent carrying neither is no place that I want to spend my hard earned dollars Yay Barneys"
5,Guacamole was best Ive had
5,Love Bakers I live in Glendale an it is worth the drive to go see them They know their stuff and am always pleased with my purchases
5,Excellent
5,Terrific food and service Happy hour from 36 is totally worth it for the free childrens meals and half price drinks The french onion burger is delicious
5,"Some of the best pizza Ive ever had The sauce is amazing Every time Im in town I get the sausage and pepperoni with extra sauce

Theres nothing else to say really Go here for good pizza"
5,"Great Pizza Great Service

Weve been here a few times since it opened And always look forward to going We have never had a bad experience Each time has been great Our waiter Dave was perfect always on the ball"
1,I just had a pretty unfortunate experience at Bison Witches in Tempe  I remember liking this place when I went to ASU but not anymore  It literally no exaggeration took 15 hours for our lunch which was 3 people eating soups and sandwiches  Our order took 45 minutes to arrive at our table again soup and sandwiches and several tables around us that had come in AFTER us got food before us  I normally am pretty easy going about stuff like this but the server and a guy that appeared to be a managerowner didnt even acknowledge the long wait time no apology nothing  They werent even that busy  Our server barely even spoke to us when she came to the table and acted like we were inconveniencing her  I also saw her roll her eyes at another one of her tables as they got up to leave  What kind of service is that  I wish I could say the food was any saving grace but it wasnt  Mediocre soup in a bread bowl less than mediocre turkey on a bland sandwich  I will NOT be going back theres no point  Save your time and money and hit up another one of the tasty places on Mill Ave  Trust me youll be better off
5,"DECEMBER 2012They still have the ANGRY WHOPPER
Best whopper EVER
Mine goes no lettuce heavy onion heavy tomato and BBQ sauce on the bottom bun
Its THICK

55 year anniversary  second whopper 55 cents
DEAL

Really have you ever had a BAD whopper "
5,this was our first breakfast hitup since we moved back and gotta say it againthe protein pancakes are still da bomb so lucious cruchy yet soft sweet yet salty healthy but so much syrupmmmm go at an off time or youll be knocking elbows with the elderly
5,"AWESOME 

I love this place I am from Seattle and Ive been struggling to find a good pho restaurant since moving out here Khai Hoan reminds me of some of the restaurants I used to go to back home  I love holeinthewall family restaurants like this one No fuss no frills Just good food and fast serviceWe were greeted seated ordered and got our appetizer in 10 minutes Food was delicious Definitely go here"
5,I had a facial with Jennifer and it was fantastic  She used all proper techniques and overall it was a very relaxing and wonderful experience  Would definitely recommend this spa for anyone living or vacationing in the area
5,"Yum yum yum 

I have put this in my regular rotation for every time Im in Gilbert  They have great sandwiches sides and burgers and for the most part we have had some fantastic service my friend has had one or two iffy experiences but mine have all been great this past weekend I had one of their burgers of the week which had some white wine grilled onions with Gruyere cheese and it was KILLER probably my fave burger Ive had there  Ive also tried their soups which have been great and their grilled cheese  The Caprese Pasta Salad is so refreshing and a fave side of mine"
1,Filthy place  Bad tasteless food  Rude waitress  Yuck
5,"I love this place

We werent sure what to expect since the restaurant is in an office building plaza  Kinda weird but the employees in the other businesses are lucky

We went in here on a whim after reading all the awesome Yelp reviews  Our first impression was a girl at the front and she was super nice and didnt rush us while we were checking out the menu options

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni  cheese and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans  He also ordered a side of ribs to sample  The wait wasnt too bad  it took about 10 or 15 minutes and it was ready to go  They are cool with their sauce and let you fill up the small plastic cups and take as much as you want of it which is awesome because the sauce tastes SO good   Its a nice thick sauce and they have several flavors to choose from

We go to a nearby area to have a little picnic by ourselves and notice that they forgot to include the side of ribs  We pack everything up and go back to get those  The employees were really nice about it and apologized and gave my husband the side of ribs  We repeat the same process and realize that they also messed up my husbands order and gave him a pulled pork sandwich instead of the brisket sandwich  We decide to let it go and eat our food

The pulled pork has great flavor  The meat actually tastes like it has been smoked for several hours and is good enough to eat on its own without any sauce  However we werent going that route because the sauce is too damn good not to eat  The baked beans and macaroni  cheese were not anything special but they were good  The ribs were our favorite part  We absolutely loved them  Very tender and the sauce they chose to slather them in was delicious

This place is pretty far from where we live but we would definitely go out of our way again to eat here more"
5,I love the fish tacos from Rubios I always order them Well sometimes I get the shrimp or Salmon tacos and I also love that black salsa chipotle sauce and the chips are delish here
5,Every time I visit Arizona I love to eat here to food is vary good and I have my wife to thank for turning me on too this restaurant I wish they would have some in Georgia
5,"i always forget about this place when we do a party they carry costumes and party gear year roundeven halloween stuff 

stopped in today to look for a flintstones costume but they had no Freds and the wilma they had for 50 bucks we bought online for 30 bucks i had an online coupon for 15 bucks so i only bought house decor for halloween but if you need any kind of prop for a costumetheme party bike pub ride or just feel like dressing up this place is perfect"
5,If youre looking for a lunch saladSandwich this place is great  Not too busy but thats good because its very quaint  The roost beef and bluecheese sandwich will fill your stomach and the cookie side is a nice treat
5,Dont judge a book by its cover  The outside doesnt look so great but you go inside and its gorgeous  The food is some of the best food Ive ever eaten  Their sugar cane chicken appetizer is fantastic The pad thai chiang mai noodles pad kra po pad lard na etc  This place is so flavorful with fresh veggies and fresh herbs  And dont get me started on their fried honey banana dessert  The best dessert Ive ever had  Check this place out you will not be disappointed
5,I WISH I LIVED IN SCOTTSDALE I stopped by Yogurtland because I went to Spring Training and I wish I could have stayed forever The quality of the frozen yogurt is impeccable So many flavors I mixed Raspberry Cheesecake with Vanilla Bean also tried the PBJ flavor um YES Tangerine Tango and my usual goto Tart Very extensive toppings bar Good price as well I just love froyo Next time Im in Scottsdale this will be one of the first places I go to
1,Poor servicesmall portionspricey
5,Excellent neighborhood spot with outstanding food large portions and reasonable price The staff make you feel special and I have not made a bad menu choice Try the wings with sauce on the side or the Monday night fried chicken Lunch or dinner Wallys receives 5 stars from me
5,Those of us foodies know that if the company is not good the food is not goodregardlesswhich is why I am happy to give Bar North such a great review  I was there with a terrific group of people STAR 1  We were able to relax on the patio with clean furniture I might add overlooking the fountains in an intimate setting where we could hear one another STAR 2  The wine list was good at a fair ie expected price STAR 3  The appetizers and salads were awesome STAR 4  And the waitstaff Damn I wish I could remember her name was incredible STAR 5  nough said
5,I prefer going to this location of Macayos over the others because of the ambience Its way different than the others and it doesnt feel like the other Macayos This one is much more festive It has a ton of patio seating and lots of shade The antique train outside makes it much more interesting The parking lot however is right next to the light rail tracks and its small so parking is a little dicey They sacrificed parking for patio seating The prices are extremely affordable Their food is very good Service is always consistent Cheap margaritas Ive never been here on a weekend I always stop in on a weekday around noon and then it has some business people on lunch
5,This ice has the abilty to make you feel COLD on a 100 degree day  I am hooked on the Key Lime Alexs Lemonade and Florida Orange Very nice staff friendly and free samples 
5,"This is the new mecca of Phoenix music 

Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nitas Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all He is a music fan first and  well  thats just what he is  a music fan not a natural businessman 

The place is just beautiful for now soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt The room is small  stage big for the size  no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come

Thank you Charlie

Music fans unite This place MUST thrive

btw  they have live music every single night of the week  and they open at 4pm every day the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment"
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT Best Mexican food we have had in Arizona yet We are partial as we just bought in Fountain Hills and its close but its also small and although lively never crowded or noisy The service is friendly and fast and the Mexican style music is great but not too loud You can easily talk and relax Loved the guacomole dip and shrimp cocktail and the fried ice cream is fab and big enough for four people
5,"I think that most of the negative reviews Ive read about this Golds gym really stem from peoples own insecurities I have been going here almost 2 months now and have never had a single issue with the gym or ANY of its staff or members I find the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful and I was even offered a free personal training session when I signed up to help me get on the right track to meeting my fitness goals 

I read one review about some poor girl stepping onto a treadmill that was going full speed and falling off who does that Did she not see the treadmill going FULL SPEED Dont blame lack of common sense on the gym or its staff

Another review complained that there are too many gay men hanging out in the locker room REALLY As a straight male I can say that Ive never felt uncomfortable and have never been solicited for sex in the locker room Get over yourself and your homophobia dude Some yelpers truly disgust me

Great location in a beautiful new area convenient hours tons of parking a BEAUTIFUL state of the art facility what is there to complain about Show up work out hard and go home feeling better about yourself thats what gyms are for"
1,This place is a dump Im a widow and I have a longterm chronic condition still they allowed their tenant to pick on me throw a bottle at me then their maintenance person told me the lock was never changed They did not paint but lied and said they did Its totally druginfested They dont keep their word  I would skip it
5,Still flying solo  My friends took me for dinner here and it was excellent  Humus appetizer was great  For main course did broiled chicken pita wrap and it was perfect  Recommend
5,"one of my favorite places    the place has great atmosphere and character  the bar is a great place to unwind with friends or meet new ones or have dinner  Michael or Jan will take great care of you at the bar    The full menu is offered here

the dining area is warm elegant  comfortable but you are fine to wear your favorite blue jeansit is cave creek you know

i have never ordered anything from the menu that did not impress    regardless of where i dine if there is a rib eye on the menu i have to try it Cartwrights rib eye cooked over mesquite is consistently  my favorite    

from the fish dept the sea bass is succulent     my second favorite is the scallops they too are cooked over wood and have great flavortexture and are seared perfectly

you have to save room for desertthe apple fritters pair well with their local fresh roasted coffee

you can not go wrong at Cartwrights"
5,I love this mall You need a giant mall like this when it is 120 degrees outside It is one of the only indoor malls that I like I feel so calm when I am here You can find just about anything in this mall  The food court is pretty good  I like Paradise Cafe for sandwiches  There are sit down restaurants and a movie theater inside as well  Plenty of parking or you can just valet  My favorite Nordstroms is here  I find the Nordies in SF to be too big and overwhelming  The one at the Fashion Square is minimalist well organized and edited to suit my tastes
5,"great service great food and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant

you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable local breeze made it tolerable and i dont think my overlysweaty ass ever felt uncomfortable once during the whole dining experience they had fans a swamp cooler and misters going and it made for a comfortable and charming outdoor dining venture

we started off with the greek lavosh which was to die for the cheese they melted on top of it will make any cheese lover weak in the knees their mojiot lemonade was crisp and refreshing ok selection of beers certainly not the greatest but i picked out a favorite kiltlifter to go with my cocacola ham sandwich my girlfirned Rachel O went with the atomic burger as we are both fans of spicy food and this burger comes topped with horseradish it even made her face scrunch up and me quiver in my seat the moment it hit my tongue and you better believe i enjoyed every second of it the coca cola ham was HUGE and both of us only managed to eat half of it leftovers are always good

service was spot on and i enjoyed the decor and atmosphere despite what many people have complained about before get over it its no longer pallete move on and enjoy the local breeze"
1,My brother also posted about our Mothers Day experience These must be franchises because the Scottsdale and Chandler locations are like eating at a different restaurant entirely This is the second and last time we will frequent this location The pizza and calzones were awful
5,"I took a friend from Europe here this past week I cannot express how much the attention to detail is welcomed and so wonderfully presented By this I mean the service the presentation the food the atmosphere The staff knows that when you walk in you will be spending good money and they expect to take care of your whim and cater to your palette 
The steaks are buttery delicious and worth every bite The sommelier made a wonderful suggestion to go with our order and he was spot on in his selection This may not be the place to dine on a regular basis for some but if you plan to make a special night of an occasion I recommend highly Ruths Chris I have not been to the one in Phoenix only the Scottsdale location but I would be hard pressed to say that it would be any less tasty 
My buddy was treated so kindly and his comment paraphrased was as follows Its too bad that so much of the world hates Americans They think that Americans are so loud and bossy They can be so kind and so willing to to be helpful when they want In Europe no one cares if you are from France or Italy or Dernmark because we are like states next to each other In America everyone wants to know about where you are from and want to hear you talk about it and the places you have been

Thank you to the staff for being a part of my friends visit"
5,I had heard many great things about Penzeys but it wasnt until recently that I actually went to the store After shopping around and smelling various spices I wanted to buy everything in the store Great for gifts as well
5,"Love it
The food is VERY spicy though  Luckily I have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors however the wussies out there should take note 

Just realize that this place is VERY small and can get VERY crowded

I was there once and George W Bush came in to eat there  Evidently he loves the food"
5,"It was a very lovely place I had read the reviews before arriving and had read that the place looked dated but it looked very nice to me Ive been to several hilton family hotels since my hubby is a diamond member and this is one of the better places weve been to

The only thing that was sorta a deal breaker was that it wasnt near downtown"
5,"One of my fave restaurants The unlimited salad is a winner Its delicious They also have a glutenfree selection that my brother loves 

For Christmas they also have some gift card deals"
5,Great selection TONS of flavor always hot and fresh nice staff great prices In my top 3 quick restaurants
5,"What a great property Only had been to the bar years ago after the renovation finally had a chance to stay in a Studio room this weekend I was over the moon after this stay

I was looking for a nice weekend treat for me an my girlfriend Vegas was tempting but the drive eats up time I just dont have and I dont gamble For about the same as a discounted room at the Mirage and fuel expenses I was able to get a gorgeous suite at the Valley Ho 

Very fast friendly check in No lines no bullshit resort fees and a personable guy behind the counter Never get that in Vegas

Decor is startlingly unique In a sea of cookie cutter mega resorts a nice spin on hip 1960s American style is a welcome change of pace The details are like no other hotel Ive stayed in and the grounds are well landscaped and immaculate Its quite humbling to think this place has seen patrons for 55 years 

Studio Suite is super cool Clean good sized and hip Tub in the center of the room was very very cool and was very useful Good bed good linens great shower Dug the little patio and the large sliding glass doors were awesome on a cool fall morning Good colors too Only a few gripes the bed side lamps are unusable with their super bright nasty color temperature CFLs Thankfully theres lots of other mood lighting available Also the ceiling was starting to look a bit worse for wear with some sagging at the joints and some water stains Flat roofs always leak though In room music system ala Hard Rock would be a great addition since TV is for the birds  

Location is unbeatable A short walk to anything in Old Town Fashion Square nightclub block etc But far enough away from the bars that its quiet at night Found a great new restaurant The House on Main St that I would have never stumbled across otherwise Probably the only worthwhile walkable district in Phoenix that never disappoints and this hotel takes advantage of it 

I will absolutely be back Makes a great in town escape Just wish I would have tried it out sooner"
5,"If you are writing poor reviews you obviously have not eaten Susies Chile Verde con Carne   I dream about it  And I grew up in New Mexico  The best  bowl of green chili stew or even better the green enchiladas with meltinyourmouth beef anywhere in town  13dont forget the sour cream   

So you with the 2  3 stars go back and try the green chili and watch your stars become shooting stars  Ive never tried anything else there  Why would you when youve found green chili heaven Man just talking about it makes me drool  Im headed out the doorSusies here I come"
5,All I have to say is wow  The auto picks and portrait pick that MelonFishPhoto did for me blew my mind  I felt pretty confident after seeing some of the photos he had done but my expectations were far exceeded  He has a creative eye that caught much more than just the personality of the car  The picture brought tons of people to my sites asking who shot the pics  The portraits were truly great and fun to do  I actually saw myself in a new light that I never saw before  I loved it  Anyone can take a picture but very few people can take pictures that draw people in and seem to almost have an active emotion behind them  I strongly recommend MelonFishPhoto to anyone for any photography need
5,"Possibly the best burger Ive ever haddefinitely the best Ive had in Phoenix

I get the classic which comes on brioche with a choice of cheese Its the only thing Ive ever ordered there because its so damn good I cant pass it up 

AND they get their beef from humanely raised grassfed cows And beer selection and the fries with aioli Well others here have told you how good they are

Pro tip Throw a little of that aioli on your burger too Oh and come hungryits a generously sized burger

Its a little pricey but Delux is a really delicious treat"
5,"Amazing Just stopped for snacks had the fake crab rangoons and samosas Very good Will mos def come back to dine hopefully several times when in town 

Love that they sell Diaya in the cooler and other lovely products books and junk foods"
5,this is perhaps the best italian food in Az We have been going there for about 10 yrs and always recommend this place to all our clients Best food which is all homemade best service This place never disappoints us We recommend this place to our  clients and the feedback is thank you for the best food experience we have had
5,"I have been dining at this Indian restaurant for a few years now  It was introduced to me by a close friend  I have taken my coworkers members of my ward my mother and brothers and finally I get a chance to review it online

I dont mind going in for dinner but the buffet is to die for  Their consistency has never failed  This place is great"
5,"lululemon is the best clothing store to hit Scottsdale since Ross 

Even though exercise shorts there cost more than an evening in Tijuana they are worth every penny So what if the pants there cost 160 They are awesome Would Batman ever question Alfred about how much he paid for the Batmobile No Because the Batmobile is awesome and Batman would have paid any price for it 

The mens side of the store doesnt carry a wide collection but what I did find was more magical than the sorting hat at Hogwarts Everything is so comfortable and if youre overweight most of the pants and shorts have elastic so you dont look like a muffin when you put them on 

I also like the workers there too They are friendly and helpful and helped me understand that even if I liked some of the womens shirts there it would not be a good idea for me to purchase one and wear it But I love teal I cried 

If you havent been to lululemon that probably means you hate small animals"
5,OMG I love this place Im from Canada and this is continentally good
5,"Why everyone in the valley doesnt use this service is beyond me  They carry every quality pet food manufactured their prices are competitive they deliverFREE no matter how small the orderright to your doorwhat a deal

 Ive used Goober for a couple of years they have never missed a delivery never been late  Great customer service and the ladies that answer the phone really know their stuff  Have a pet with allergies This is your place for quality pet food they will aldo have lots a good suggestions on your pets diet"
5,"Blue 32 wins my MVP award I practically lived at this place during the Giants World Series run and loved every moment of it 

Despite the fact that I am still stuck in an orange and blackout World Series Championship daze that will probably continue for at least another month or so I must up the rating of this place to 5 stars because Blue 32 is now my favorite sports bar in all of Scottsdale The service is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent for game watching

Here are the main two reasons why I will keep coming back here 1 Food  This is the best bar food ever You must try their onion rings they are crazy delicious Also if you arent in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well 2 TVs  Sports fans it doesnt get much better than this when it comes to TVs Outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant No sports bar in Scottsdale can compete with Blue 32s TVs

Go here for a game and you wont be disappointed I decked myself out in orange and black screamed jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games Overall Blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and youve got to check this place out

PS GO GIANTS "
5,"Harvest hash is incredible  ask for their house made BBQ sauce on the side 
Vegan raspberry banana bread French toast  Sooooo good
Its a busy place on a Saturday morning but they work fast and everything runs smoothly
A gem"
1,Banfield is okay for routine check ups for maintenance and preventive care That is why they offer a wellness plan When it comes to your animal getting sick I would go elsewhere It should not be called a Hopital The doctors are there for profit only and do not show any care for your pet The vet techs care but the doctors dont listen to them This place is lacking ethics when it comes down to making important decisions when it comes to your pets health
5,"Every time I go into this place its with good times and cheery mates and I leave the wiser with a pint of fresh brew and some of the best food 

To make a great date go to the Phoenix Rock Gym first and then climb the ladder on the back wall and walk in around the backGreat times for every one"
5,I am from Chicago  and the italian beef here really is perfection  Add to that the friendliest people ever and the amazing hotziki with fries and theyve got me forever  Their falafel wrap is insanely good and the patty melt is to die for  I could eat here every day  and I practically do
5,Super friendly Joe was there greeting everyone refilling coffee and sharing how we uses local Arizona suppliers Great diner food and decor Loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy  Will definitely be back
1,marginal sushi meets uncomfotable seating  we used restaurantcom coupon and got stuck wtih an 18 tipwith no service seriously  felt scammedthink we actually spent more based on that tip than had we just paid full price  avoid this one just not worth it
5,My favorite Mexican food  THE BEST BEAN BURRO ENCHILADA STYLE IN THE WORLD yes Ive tried them all  Get the red enchilada sauce and a tortilla on the side
5,"Fuego Bistro has quickly become one of my wife and Is favorite restaurants  We went with a large group the first time and they were great about us having 7 including two smaller children  Last night my wife and I went back for a date night and had the most wonderful time  Jeff the owner is fantastic and always wants to make sure you have a great time  The sommelier was also great  He talked to us about the wine gave us some tips for pairings and even had us take a sip of wine while chewing our food  It totally changed the character of both the wine and food

Speaking of the food the short ribs are amazing  The best sides weve had are the creamed corn and the chipotle mashed potatoes but the maple chili carrots and the cornbread green chili casserole are also very good

The cocktails are great and the happy hour menu is pretty reasonable

We will definitely be going to Fuego on a regular basis"
5,"So I knew ahead of time about the wait So we got there at 330 and waited for an hour and a half until they opened But we were able to be seated as soon as they opened

Let me just say that Ive never had anything even close to the kind of pizza that we got Its outstanding 

I highly recommend the caprese salad antipasto and the rosa pizza Though Im pretty sure that its all amazing no matter what you get"
5,Love my Chickfila  Wow they have a system and it is super fast in the drive thur  Amazed and they are always super friendly  They always get the order right  
1,DO NOT GO HERE  One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had  The setup is a little like Pei Wei where they take your order give you a number and bring the food to your table  Placed our order and had to stalk other tables and hover over people eating trying to wait to get a table  Waited a long time all the while others who ordered after us found seats and got their food before us Servers kept bringing my food to me since it was ready but I still didnt have a table so they kept saying they would put it under the heat lamp for me  Finally eventually found a table and then kept waiting and waiting for our food which the manager claimed he had them remake since it was getting cold  My food came and it was cold and disgusting  We had to get going since we were going to a show and my moms food still wasnt there  The staff asked to see her receipt since they couldnt find her order  She went up to the manager and said she just wanted her money back since we had to go it had been 45 minutes since we placed our order  He said her food would not be ready for a while and gave her some cash and we left  My mom never even ate and my food was horrible  I would NOT recommend this place its awful
5,Excellent
5,Seriously if youre looking for a place to get your knives sharpened or buy some cool professional kitchen gear look no further
5,"Of course it gets hot in the summer Youre going to be watching bands in a basement with a bunch of people and depending on when  whats going on there might be some idiots mawshing 

Sound quality is great for the size Glad they reopened one of my favorite venues and YES everybody has gotten lost the first time they tried to find the Nile The main  front room have shows as well"
5,"5 BIG STARS

For service and quality of meal restaurants really dont get any better than this Multiple servers dressed in NY black are constantly there for you

This restaurant prides itself in using local products  blending them into traditional meals ala Alice Waters and they do an excellent job

For starters we had are you ready
Macerated Local Vine Ripened Heirloom Tomatoes Fossil Creek Goat Cheese  Mascarpone Tart including Buckwheat  Saguaro Seed Tart Basil foamed from the garden Black Ice and Gila River Olive Oil and
Pan Flashed White  Green Asparagus with Chanterelles  Cholla Buds including Chanterelle Mushroom Fondue Desert Quail Egg sunny side up Red Currents and Aged Sherry

And that was just the beginning For dinner we had
Veal Ribeye Rubbed with Sandalwood Dry Mole  Green Chile Sand including Mesquite Cooked Desert Fruit Chutney Truffle Frites and Rutabaga Cobbler and
Local Pecan Crusted Colorado Lamb with Native Seeds SEARCH Mole including Pastry Tapenade of Fennel QC Olives Eggplant Wild Mushrooms Heirloom Tomatoes  Iitoi Onions

Everything was exquisite

This meal was to die for

Any complaints at all Well yes but very minor This place is actually in a Sheraton but I guess that insures a good stream of patrons that can afford such meals

And the decor Not very good It needs a serious MAKEOVER  Wallhangings window treatments  carpeting arent much

So there you are"
5,"Gymboree many years ago I brought my first son to Gymboree quite often and really enjoyed  Never thought I would be back but now we have another gymboree tike and he loves it  

I am very happy to have been reintroduced to Gymboree and have already made plans to go again with my son next week  The instructor made it look easy and really communicated very well with both parents and children 

Thinking about Gymboree now my only regret is that I know someday my boy is going to outgrow it and I want these times to last forever"
5,"Honestly I cant remember how I found out about Butter  Me but Im glad it happened

My fiancee now wife and I are addicted to cupcakes and we decided to swap the traditional wedding cake for some delicious cupcakes Kelly at Butter  Me did not disappoint She was absolutely fantastic to work with and has the best cupcakes in the valley Believe me we tastetested a number of other vendors and everyone elses cupcakes tasted like small dry cakes

The cupcakes from Butter  Me were exactly what we were looking for They were perfectly moist beautifully decorated and there are a ton of delicious flavors to choose from

I cannot recommend Butter  Me highly enough The Yelp review sums it up Woohoo As good as it gets"
5,Bookmans is Great  They probably dont need another positive review but so what  I use Bookmans for recycling books Ive read and for buying used books for myself  All I can say is that I like everything about the way they do business  They have great people working there  The store vibe is very positive  Their prices are very fair and what they pay for your used books is incredibly fair plus you know that youve made a positive contribution to our society by recycling books that others can enjoy  Do yourself a favor and stop in  Enjoy
5,"Outstanding customer service Great camping firewood bags HUGE bags of high quality long burning wood for 10 Cannot be beat

Cash check or use the ATM they have in the office 2 fee

5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE Its so nice to be able to eat here whenever its chilly outside Actually allow me to be honest I probably would eat here everyday but I settle for 12 times a week

I get my Pho with extra meatballs and no onions and they make it perfect for me each time The folks are awesome and no matter how busy it is everything come out SUPER fast You know a girl loves to eat in a timely manner with my hectic schedule

The Springrolls the crab puffs the chicken fried rice all amazing too For a good time time and warm feeling after a FANTASTIC meal this is the best come winter or AZ summer time"
1,"Just isnt very good

I dont understand why people give this place even three stars  Its rare for me to give a place a low rating but My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like

Ive been to this place several times over the years  This location and others   It used to be just on the lower end of OK  its never been as good as you can get from a Ma and Pa place  However we went for lunch the other day and its just gotten to the point I wouldnt even go back for a quick bite

We ordered the garlic hummus and it was overly full of garlic and not home made  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it   The olives we ordered were rough at best  UGH even thinking about them  Overly seasoned and not very fresh   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture

The first rule of good let alone great food is FRESH   This place needs a rescue

Less critical but I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place the menus were totally trashed   As in ratty tattered and dirty  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty 

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere"
5,I was visiting Tempe for Ironman Arizona and came down with pretty acute foot injury three days prior to the race  The friendly receptionist at Dr Natchers office understood the predicament I was in and managed to fit me into Dr Natchers schedule within a couple hours of my call  Dr Natchers is clearly both a great doctor and a great person she is extremely competent friendly and sympathetic  As an  runner and cyclist she is also in tune with sports injuries and the mentality of an athlete She quickly diagnosed the injury and prescribed an aggressive treatment protocol  I was in good shape on race day due to her treatment protocol and am so very thankful to Dr Natcher for putting me in the position to complete the race in fine fashion  I was paying outofpocket and  was very pleasantly surprised by the cost of the office visit  I cant speak highly enough of my experience with Dr Natcher
5,"My first visit to Sweet Republic and when I was done my first thought was why did I take so long to come here

I sampled a few of their ice creams and let me tell you  All delicious  In particular the mint chip ice cream was delicious  It tastes like fresh mint because get this it is

Service was quick and friendly  We got in right before a rush and let me tell you the staff were able to handle it like pros

Each of their ice creams are homemade and you can just taste the love mixed into each one  You can tell how proud they are of their creations  I wont go into the kinds of ice cream they have but can tell you that whatever you choose you will love

Stop on down took me 30 minutes to get there from Gilbert and enjoy a cone or cup  Do yourself a favor and dont delay for 3 years like I did"
5,We were craving Mexican food and since we were in the area I decided to check on my trusty yelp app on my phone to find a perfect food joint to check out  Sure enough it came through for us and told us about this little gem tucked away in an area I had been several times but had never noticed it before  I am so very glad I tried it as it will now be my goto place for Mexican food  The food is delicious and fresh and reasonably priced  The guacamole is a must try and the carne asada is so good  If youre in the mood for Mexican and in the area I would definitely recommend this place
5,This place is one of my favorite burger joints  If you really appreciate a good burger I dont think youll be disappointed  Kobe burger Double truffle fries Creme Brulee Shake and just pure joy  First time the burger was slightly over cooked for medium rare but ever since I have been back multiple times and its been prepared perfectly to my expectations  I do believe in second chances and they won me over  I dont get the mushroom on the Kobe Meat is very tasty and flavorful no need to add any toppings  The Samburger and Zinburger are very tasty as well  Last time I added bacon to the Zinburger very good and I do recommend that  The staff are very attentive to diners needs  I have tried a few of the FoxRC and every time has been an excellent experience so far  I hope it wont change  SF definitely has a unique and entrepreneurial vision in food industry which has and will make him very successful
5,"Seriously soo good Drove 60miles to come here about 5 times in the 3 months that I lived in AZ 

I came here because of the triple D episode and it was soo worth it Burgers fries onion rings sweet potatoe fries and pizza are ALL GOOD 
and check out their bathrooms its pretty cool too 

Tried Joes Real BBQ which is their first restaurant but it was just OK 
Joes Farm grill is def one of my fav places"
5,This place is awesome and it replaced Trader Joes as my new grocery store The produce is plentiful and fresh they have Boars Head at the deli and they have organic options The meat is way more reasonably priced than AJs It reminds me of a small Whole Foods without the ridiculous prices
5,"This is Mesas best breakfast hands down This is one of my familys favorite SaturdaySunday brunch places in the valley 

Crackers  Co is great food at great prices and we always take outoftown guests there when visiting

I was never a fan of eggs unless they were scrambled or in an omelette but Crackers showed me the way to delicious fried and poached eggs  The Eggs Benny is great both Traditional and Californiastyle Their omelettes are huge and never overcooked my fave Spinach Mushroom  The skillets are mighty tasty and really satisfying my fave The Vatican with eggs over easy Try their French toast its got great flavor and is delightfully crispy 

If you get a chance try lunch there Their soups are so scrumptious and the sandwiches are to die for The Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup tastes just like a bowl of spinach and artichoke dip and they dont skimp on the artichokes at all The Chicken Dumpling soup is seriously the best Ive ever had Im not even a fan of dumplings The Roma Tomato Chicken Melt is my favorite sandwich on the menu such good flavor followed closely by the Drunken Chicken sandwich Their burgers are quite good and along with their salads they serve up a hefty portion

Beware though of 30 to 45 minute wait times on the weekends in the winter due to snowbirds flocking for breakfast The wait times let up about 1230P though so its great for those who cant decide between breakfast or lunch"
5,"FEZ for brunch on Saturday with a bunch of girlfriends was one of the highlights of my weekend Several of us ordered the FEZ Fritatta and it was perfectly cooked with tasty toppings and the best bacon on the side I also sampled the sweet potato fries and they were even better than anticipateda standout

Plates looked pretty Cmon thats important Presentation people Service was superb

Hadnt been to FEZ in a while and forgot how delicious it is Lets go to FEZ more often girls"
5,I love this theater its 100  digital and very clean and the staff is friendly I believe that the have child care if you have any also lots of great restaurants and shopping all within walking distance in the shops  Norterra
5,"WeKoPa has been prominently listed as one of the places to play if you are in Arizona  I first played it several years ago and it has become one of my favorite desert courses in Arizona   There are two courses  Cholla and Saguaro and although they are both desert courses they are somewhat different The cholla course is an older more mature course and doesnt have the same feel as the Saguaro course  The Saguaro course can be walked but has a wild side to it and to me seems to have more elevation changes That said both courses are immaculate wonderful condition and a joy to play

Over the years I have played the Saguaro course more but lately the Cholla course has grown on me  Now when my golfing buddies come down I always make it a point to play both courses with them  This has led to some interesting memories  

The first time we played despite my warnings one of the players wandered off the Saguaro course and found a Jumping Cholla  He liked it so much he brought it back to us  stuck all down one side of his body  It took us quite a while to get them off of him  and then he wanted us to give him extra strokes Not a chance

Another time one of my friends teed off on a par 3 on the Cholla course and hit it into a dry creek bed He seemed to lose his composure and hit five provisionals which also went into the desert Then he found his first ball and ended up with a par  Of course we havent let him forget the five provisionals

I have read some comments about the marshals on the course and in the past would agree However the last two times we played the marshals have been very good  very courteous and very helpful  The last time while we were playing cart path only one of the players was very slow as usual and the female marshal most diplomatically asked us to speed up  She was one of the nicest most courteous marshals I have had experience with and consequently one of the most effective

The courses have a nice driving range chipping and sand area and putting greens Unfortunately they no longer allow you to use them unless you are playing one of the courses you used to be able to pay a daily fee to use them

Finally the service is friendly and courteous  from the drop off to the restaurant to the desk personnel I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the employees

I think any golfer should experience these courses at least once  a visit would be well worth it"
5,"Haus Murphys is fabulous in so many ways that I can really only hit the highlights here Even if German food isnt your favorite I dislike saurkraut and cabbage the service and food is great

The service was wonderful I was almost 2 hours earlier than my friends so I used a table in the bier garden to do some work on my computer with my own mobile hotspot   Haus Murphys does not have wifi The entire staff made me feel welcome as a sipped a wonderful German beer and did some work

My friends showed up we had great dinners and then we continued on to Glendale Glitters If Im able to make it over to Glendale from my home in Mesa for Glendale Glows in January I will certainly stop in Haus Murphys 

Authentic German or not Ive never been to Germany my friends of mine who have seemed to really enjoy the food too this place is worth the visit 

Enjoy"
5,This has to be the best Thai food around I have tried a few other places but none are as authentic and delicious as Swaddee We are now regulars and have never been disappointed
1,Slow unorganized and filled to the brim with crazy people I prefer to do everything through the service arizona website but recently got a letter that I needed to get a new license because my picture was going to expire It makes total sense that my license is valid until Im 65 but the picture expires after 11 years Of course the state charges a nominal fee of 12 to replace it If the state of AZ was in need of my money Id gladly just give it to them if it means avoiding this nightmare Oh and the camera is set to fat
5,"SAKE    Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice usually served hot 

 Full disclosure  I dont like sake

Parents in Scottsdale for a first look at the new house  neighborhood We were on the horns of a dilemma   Would a mid week  early season dinner at the club be too quiet Should we  descend south of  the Frank Loyd Wright  into south  north Scottsdale

We opted for the safe bet  booked a car and headed south to the Ocean Club

 A never drink and drive in Scottsdale  or anywhere else for that matter

B if youre a foreigner  never ever drink and drive in Scottsdale

C A  B refer to you Nikolai Khabibulin 


 A nod of support to the YELP community  After perusing the Ocean Club reviews retrospectively I believe the correlation existing between the posted notes and reality to be around 090 Well Done
 I would go as high as a correlation of 095 if high and low marks were thrown out  similar to olympic skating or gymnastics


We arrived at the club a good bar crowd  not quite as Mountain lionessy as i had expected  hoped   mid week perhaps
a good blend of hipsters  hobos and Mrs Lovey Howell IIIs

I am captivated  or is it the Grey Goose

 does he really know the name of the Italian girl who dug this evenings truffles up in Piedmont

5,Best in south chandler  Glad they are out here
5,What a find  In a strip mall nestled between a bank clothing stores and overnight shipping is Giuseppes  A family owned and run establishment where byob is the way to go  This reminds me of countless small mom and pops back in The City  The staff is friendly the portions sizable and the check small to medium  In fact I cant believe I havent reviewed this restaurant before  Whether on a date or with the family Ive never had a bad experience in the dozens of times Ive been there  From the veal parmagian sp to the eggplant from the fettucine to the spaghetti and meatbeals mama mia  It is a small venue with very limited outdoors seating during good weather  And the locals know about it so it gets pretty packed Thursday through Sunday  The salads and appetizers are delicious as well If this restaurant had been in Spinal Tap it would get an eleven
5,"Ive been coming to Yusefs now for awhile to get gyro meat to go along with their fresh feta pitas and cucumber yogurt BEST IVE HAD Finally I was able to eat there as they have a kitchen and OMG it was delis and the prices are fabulous I ordered the lentil soup and holy cow it was UNREAL I got the gyro plate with gyro meat and fresh rice basmati and it was fabulous Gyro Greek salad was amazing too I love coming here because the owner is nice and very sweet

I recommend you try this little gem Its worth the drive"
5,"Not many places that you can go and get a natural casing charred white hot dog outside of western NY
Folks I know from Western NY love this place and I have to agree even though Ill still take a good Chicago dog any day
I know where Ill be going if I ever have an itch for a white hot "
5,I love everything about Oreganos  My first experience was in Flagstaff with a location being right off NAUs campus and I was thrilled more started to open up in the valley  There is one in Mesa now very close to me and the ambiance remains the same  I love the vintage decoration the music usually Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz icons and the FOOD  All the appetizers are amazing especially the Boom Dip  My favorite pizza is the ORiva  And passing up the Pizzookie pizza cookie is out of the question get your friends to dive into this amazing desert  Also the bellinis are outstanding  Enjoy your experience here you will fall in love Have patience at the smaller locations usually there will be a wait
1,The service level and attitude of the staff was diabolical they demonstrated absolutely no interest in our business Ever since moving to the new premises things have sucked I shall not be wasting any more of my time or money here
5,best place in scottsdale to watch a game Great food greasy but what bar food isnt great drink specials and an even better atmosphere The owner came by and greeted us and made us feel very welcome I will definitely return in the future
1,"Ive been to Milanos Music several times and each experience is worse than the first time  I look at the reviews of people I actually know and realize that each experience is different  On the biggest day of the year for Small Business owners who should be reaching out to the customers and gladly sell them the smallest items Milano misses that point by miles  My husband is relearning to play the drums and needed a drummers throne and since it was November 24th and Small Business Saturday I thought why not give them another try guess what we walked out with Nothing they lost potential set of drum customer   those can cost anywhere from a few 100 to 1k   I wont go back in there  The guy that is in charge of the drum section is rude and pompous and walked away from us TWICE  The second time was enough to make my blood boil  We found a throne in another section that my husband liked and I said lets get it  The guy came over and said Oh I have another one in the box and grabbed the one in my husband hands and walked off never to be seen again  We waited and waited at the checkout counter for him to show up he never did because he had decided to help another couple  I looked at the cashier and my husband and said NOT cool at all and my husband set all the other items he was going to purchase down and said we wont be purchasing anything  

I felt bad for the guy at the register because it wasnt his fault and he apologized but that doesnt give the guy running a section the right to decide what customer is more important and that is what he did  New customers should never be treated any differently and to basically make a statement of you are not important enough was the final straw  

I grew up around Milanos music stores they were the first  to give me guitar lessons and it is sad to see this happy  Besides this Yelp review  I plan to write their the store personally  When small businesses are struggling and this kind of thing happens  a person begins to understand why more people shop with a big box store and less and less from Mom and pop stores"
1,"I have been a regular customer at this salon ever since it opened  At first it was great  Clean relaxing and welcoming   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure  She paid attention to detail and didnt rush through the whole process  I didnt have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday  

The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb  I didnt notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off revealing it  Tracy was doing someone elses nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it    I was shocked that she didnt tell him to at least put his gloves back on  The massage that he gave me was hardly any massage at all  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv  Definitely not worth the 25   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I dont get an infection  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received Even though I had a great gel manicure here my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back"
5,Im addicted Everyone there is so freakin nice And Maui dogs are delicious
5,"We attended this restaurant for an early seating at 5 pm and were immediately impressed with the atmosphere and professional staff   Both were first class

We decided to sit at the counter overlooking the chefs preparing the food and we were glad we did  One young fellow was more than happy to answer any questions we had regarding the preparation as well as the presentation of the food  It really was fun to watch the whole process

We decided to go straight to the entree instead of filling up on an appetizer beforehand and we were glad we chose to do that  We each ordered the Kobe Vaca Encebollada which was a grilled Kobe skirt steak nestled on a bed of caramelized onions  Alongside the steak were three slices of potato about a half inch thick and these were topped with a guacamole type mixture as well as other toppings  They were absolutely delicious and I was so sad to reach the end of those  The steak was cooked to absolute perfection and I was determined to clean my plate because it too was just so scrumptious  It was a very ample portion and we did clean our plates and definitely had no room for dessert unfortunately  As our cocktail we followed another reviewers lead and ordered virgin mojitos which were 950ea and they were delicious and also sufficed as a dessert standin so the tab wasnt too crazy at all  Well worth it for that delicious steak

We did dress up for the occasion and were glad we did as everyone was dressed casually but nice  Its fun to have the whole experience for a special night out  

We look forward to returning soon"
1,"We were driving around Chandler area to find a decent place to eat and Mido Sushi caught our attention Oh Okay  I thought and walked right in We were greeted right away with a good waitress but somehow I found her voice was really annoying
The food came out after 10minutes and I was disappointed with the sashimi It wasnt as fresh as I expected The soy sauce tasted very weird and too salty By far this is not the most decent sushi restaurant Ive experienced 
Kabuki and Masa sushi are still my best choice so far"
5,"This place is as good as it gets for shooting   I became a full member today after also researching Shooters World Phoenix Rod  Gun and Scottsdale Gun Club where I will also become a member   The cost is VERY reasonable at 85year 110 after adding the initial administrative fee

The club is huge 140 acres   There is a main range for members and the public  Then there are multiple other shooting areas for members only   You can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility AND you can shoot any weapon   The only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo  

Im really looking forward to shooting at this club next weekend"
5,"Not exactly what I expected I liked it 

I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses 

What I got was a cool little funky building with cool interior and neat things on the walls More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area Killer staff and great food 

I had a burger I believe flat grilled cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef They said they grind it themselves The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type The beans were different They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out 

It ended up being a little expensive 9 for the burger and Fries 250 for the drink and 150 for the beans Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch"
1,My daughter and I went in for pedicures and gel sets was incredibly surprised to hear the total was 120 even with a coupon When I got home I noticed that my pedicure wasnt the best I really dont mind paying top dollar for top dollar services but even with a coupon it wasnt worth it Wont be back
5,"Being a former band nerd in high school so much nostalgia kicked in upon entering the museum I saw all the instruments I was familiar with in high school and many others that I wasnt familiar with and learned much about 

They supply you with headphones and a wireless receiver that plays the audiovideo of the different sections you walk into Each plays a sample of what the instruments sound like and some give detailed history on the instrument Very enlightening experience

Best Part IMO They have a room where you get to test random instruments to your hearts content I really wanted to go ham on the gong but there was a sign that said something along the lines of do not hit the gong repeatedly I was disappoint but otherwise many other instruments in there kept me occupied for awhile xylophone conga harp etc

Its not an arm and a leg to get inside and this place has something for everybody Youre sure to spend a few hours enjoying yourself here

If youre going to do anything in Phoenix this is one of the spots you should definitely check out"
5,Went here for our anniversary  Pretty much what you would expect from an upper end steak house  Yes its pricey  Steaks were good and service was attentive  A good place to celebrate
5,"Dinner for four at the soft opening
The food kept us talking about the tastes and combinations far into the night

Smallshared plates will fill you up quickly  The Hamachi Crudo was a fresh light starter with peppers fennel and sea beans to fire up your appetite Grilled asparagus and a delicate cheesy risotto were great sides but the smoked beef rib was a taste sensation  Sweet and savory smoky and succulent sticky and sumptuous Bleu cheese grits and grilled peaches were the perfect pairing  ahhhh sigh  I think Id pass up the tater tots and save room for something else  

This restaurant is just what Phoenix needs  Close to the ball parks or walk off your dinner in an invigorated downtown Blue Hound Kitchen is a great addition to the energy"
5,"Good God where has this been hiding My bf and I just made our periodic trip to Phoenix and discovered this little gem From his kids no less 

We went during the 8pm10pm Happy Houron a Friday night We got a table in about 20 minutes for 6 of us Our server was super friendly and took our drink order right away The cosmos and appletinis were 4 and the sake bombs with Kirin or Sapporo were 5 and numerous rolls were 5 each how do you beat that 

The food was spectacular We ordered off of the regular menu 2 orders or tuna tataki 2 orders of heart attacks and a dragon roll and the happy hour menu crispy spicy tuna philadelphia roll calamari roll shrimp tempura roll and a couple of others that I cant seem to remember OMG one slice of that tuna tataki and I was SOLD This was some seriously great sushiBravo Yen Sushi 

Our bill for 6 peeps was 96 thats with the tip included no lessYAY I will definitely be back"
5,"This place was great When one of my coworkers sent an email to our group who was visiting Phoenix saying he had gotten us a reservation at The BEST pizza in the country i Was skeptical Best pizza in Phoenix Well I wasnt disappointed 

We had a group of 8 and we ordered almost one of everything on the menu
Apps
Antipasto  Wood Roasted Vegetables Sopressata Bite of Cheese
Spiedini  Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma served warm 
Pizza
MARGHERITA  Tomato Sauce Fresh Mozzarella Basil 
MARINARA  Tomato Sauce Oregano Garlic No Cheese 
ROSA  Red Onion Parmigiano Reggiano Rosemary AZ Pistachios 
SONNY BOY  Tomato Sauce Fresh Mozzarella Salami Gaeta Olives 
BIANCOVERDE  Fresh Mozzarella Parmigiano Reggiano Ricotta Arugula 
WISEGUY  Wood Roasted Onion House Smoked Mozzarella Fennel Sausage 

Of all of them the Biancoverde was my absolute favorite I dont eat pork so I couldnt sample them all but Id happily order this one again In fact my team is returning next week for another team dinner for the coming Phoenix trip and I will for sure be ordering this

Their house draft beer is also quite tasty

Tip  if you are a party of 610 get a reservation They dont take reservations for smaller groups and Ive heard the wait time can be a few hours at the busiest times But worth it"
5,Ok this place was greatso great I decided to sign up on yelp and contribute to the rave reviews that encouraged me to try it out in the first place I had the fish tacos happy hour appetizer for dinner and they we cooked and seasoned well They were really good and I would definitely order again I was told it is off season in August but the place was filled with locals all very welcoming Everyone knew everyone and if they didnt like me it didnt take long to feel like one of the locals Great service too Will definitely go back
5,While my visit to pick up take out was kind of drunken blur the amazing food I ate from Diamonds after a few hours of harder than intended  drinking were JUST what the doctor ordered My buddy did all the ordering so all of it was a surprise when I sat down to eat  Quite possibly the best HotandSour soup Ive had IN MY LIFE and all of the everything else that was ordered was smack yo mama good The fried rice and lomein were divine especially cuz it was a big diet cheat for me and the EGG FOO YUNG  EGG FOO YUM Ive had much more bad Egg Foo Yung than I have had good Egg Foo Yung to the point that I never think to order it cuz it usually SUCKS but SO NOT THE CASE at Diamonds The lady at the register  super cute and I kinda like the stab joint classic chinese restaurant looks of this place no windows YES D Five stars the food seriously speaks for itself
1,Ok food Super slow 3 employees and 2 customers and I could not believe how long it took for a quesadlla which was cold when I got itthe tacos were decent thoughGive it a try and you decide though
5,I absolutely LOVE this place Their pizza is in my top 3 as far as the selection in Arizona and the ONLY downside is that the Tempe location to my knowledge still doesnt have any of the pasta dishes that some of the other locations have The crust is always perfect the sauce is sweet but with just the right amount of spice to it and the cheese and toppings are flawless On top of having some of the best pizza in town their customer service is topnotch If you havent tried Spinatos yet put it on your todo list
5,Brought my car here bc of the reviews I read on yelp My fan was running excessively The mechanic came and looked at my car The coolant was low He grabbed a can and filled it up No charge I then told him I needed new struts He quoted me a price that was cheaper than the one quoted to me in CO a few months ago I honestly didnt shop around for a cheaper price here in Phoenix which is unlike me The reviews here and fixing my fan problem at no charge had me sold It seems so rare to find an honest mechanic nowadays especially in this economy  Made an appt Car was finished super quick in the time frame that was promised The mechanic went out of his way to show me the damage struts he replaced then told me my new struts came with a lifetime warranty Dang did I time warp back into the 50s  Hopefully I wont have a need to go back but if I do Id gladly drive out of my way one hour round trip for their honesty again
1,I went for family birthday on a Friday night Only a few people in dining room eating 1st clue to leave Ordered a margarita Its extra to have it shaken But I ordered that way It was mostly sour mix An it was awful How do you mess up a margarita2nd clue to leave Server is surprised we wanted to order dinner 3rd clue to run Very disappointing I got the chicken fajitas they had sauce all over them Shrimp appetizer consists of 3 shrimp 8 Salsa was good  I will never go back Good luck Salty I love your decor Why dont you care you could be so cool
1,"I wish I could review the cold food stand attached to this restaurant separately because I want to tell any and all persons who think to stop by for quick sandwich to stay far far away from the tuna 

I thought nothing was worse than slowly starving on my flight back home but I found it in the form of this cold barelyrecognizableasfood sandwich I think Id prefer eating tuna out of the can over this"
5,"Love Love LOVE Bakers Nursery  Been going there since I was a child thanks to my grandparents my grandad and uncle used to do roofing work for the owners decades ago 

Seriouslythis place is FANTASTIC and the people who work there are AWESOME  

Want to know what plantstrees you have in your yard  Bring in a leaf or bark sample and theyll tell you  Found out we have Chinaberry treesmessy Lantana evil and will not die 2 Trumpet vines attracts hummingbirds and a Texas Sage bush beautiful purple flowering bush in our yard 

Want to know what type of tree would do well in your yard  Just ask  

Need something transplanted  Buy the pots and theyll replant your plants for you  

Buy a sad looking clearance plant from another local store theyll tell you how to nurse it back to health  

I could easily wander around Bakers for hours except during the heat of the day in the summertime  "
5,Over the top cheesesteaks Best in Phoenix perhaps the world Amazing food and friendly service Best ever
1,"My love affair with Fate ended when Johnny left 

The service quality and atmosphere took a total nose dive

Go to Sens instead"
5,"Bacado Yes you read that correctly The Bacado It is a glorious concoction consisting of an avocado and bacon omelette with cheese on top and served with an English muffin and country fried potatoes Decent black coffee and good service
Delicious"
1,Be VERY VERY careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap I ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich ordered it as a wrap to go I got home theres lettuce and mayo and what this whats this I see in this sandwich theres the cutoff fingertip of someones glove lodged between the lettuce At least I hope its the finger tip of a glove  Im not even going to think of the other thing it could have been Ewwww gross I didnt finish the sandwich Memo to self Dont ever get wraps from Einsteins particularly not the one on Shea Disgusting If it ever happens again Im calling a local news station to report it then Ill call the state health department Gross gross gross gross gross gross if you cant deliver sanitary wraps THEN DONT PUT THEM ON THE MENU Not a place to go if you like wraps
5,"Greenhow I love thee  Green may be veganvegetarian but I certainly wouldnt claim it to be health food  Green is located in a small run down strip mall adjacent to Kore Bicycles on the NW corner of Scottsdale Road and McKellips  It doesnt look like much from the outside and without knowing of Green you probably wouldnt do a second take upon passing it however the food here is no less than amazing  

The decor is unique and fresh 1012 tables a couchlounge area random artwork on the walls painted quotes lights hanging from the ceiling and old painted car doors along one wall  Ive tried a random assortment of items from the menu and nothing has disappointed mebut by far my favorite is the BBQ Chicken sandwich along with an appetizer of the spicy buffalo wings  I believe the mock chicken Green uses is fungus based Quorn perhaps may not sound appetizing but it is freaking awesome  I am not personally vegan or even vegetarian for that matter but Green has me hooked  Ive forced many of my meat eating friends to try Green and they have all become believers if you could call sharing something so wonderful forcing

Great prices great dishes uniquefun atmosphere and great service

 On one Saturday evening around 630 my boyfriend and I decided to pick up some Green to go the place had a line out the door and it took about 3045 min to get our food  We werent even upset about the wait just waited patiently for our delicous order and upon arrival the server gave us two free entree tickets for our next visit and apologized  THIS is how you keep your customers coming back for MORE  Love this place so much"
5,Excellent macaroons  Great owners very conversant with their costumers
5,Best pizza place ever
5,Angel sweet is without a doubt the best gelato Ive had outside of Italy
1,I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to I would have rated no stars at all I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me
5,We checked out the prices at The Dump the sales person there just were too pushy and their prices were not the lowest  We checked out the prices at Mattress Firm to see if they were any cheaper  We had a wonderful experience  The salesperson was friend and helpful NOT pushy at all  They had the iselect model bed that my friend was looking for  They were 200 cheaper delivery was cheaper and free tempur pedic pillows  SOLD  My friend is happy as a customer
5,We Care Family Wellness Center is the most exceptional doctors office and staff that I have ever found Every employee here genuinely cares about you I highly recommend
1,Remember how I said that the Trivia was the best thing about this place  Well they got rid of long time Triva host Dave who had been featured in the College Times and was the best thing about the trivia  Without Daves personality this place just doesnt cut it  Will never go here again Bummer
5,Best damn Brownies on the planet or close to it Words cannot explain how good they are The only negative is that this palce is located across the street from my office Way too much temptation
1,"Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event and Id wanted to share my love of Nobuos Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happygolucky cousin who has never been here before so we stopped by at 517p to find that Nobuo wouldnt open till 530p so we waited outside in the comfortable patio

After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables I noticed the OPEN sign on the front door so we entered the resto whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a twotop  I didnt like the energy in that room so I asked if we could sit elsewhere and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit  We were the first customers so we chose a fourtop knowing we wouldnt be taking up space for very long anyway  Glasses of water were delivered and soon we met our female server whose name on the receipt reflected Butai  When she laid down the menus I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us a look of pure distaste as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said We dont have dessert menus as we only have two and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almondorange fritters  She walked away and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have  I decided to forgo our servers very cold treatment and asked for the mousse  After all Id already finished a glass of icecold water and cousins phone needed recharging  

When Butai placed our chocolate mousse httpwwwyelpcombizphotos0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqogselectrK8m1rxl50PB69c2YqQTgrK8m1rxl50PB69c2YqQTg on the table I wanted to send it back  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here  Was she serious in presenting us with this stalelooking mousse with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it  I dont know about you but the only times Ive seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to refreeze  For me seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 400a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal so I decided we would go ahead and try it if for nothing else but to have something to report here  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl httpwwwyelpcombizphotos0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqogselecto9jIksBMObhCxoImsekQo9jIksBMObhCxoImsekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation but it was OK  The mousse was still cold and stiff and it had a mouthfeel more of like thick chocolate ganache fillingicing on a cake certainly not the silkysmooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be  My cousin had to warm up to the dish as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didnt seem like a great combo to her I told her to trust me  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together but she liked it in this dessert  

I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert which translates to a higher table bill can be a bit of a disappointment but why must you show your displeasure to your guests  Butai you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip she didnt want to give you anything and you certainly didnt deserve it  When I told other Yelp friends about the subpar service and dessert we just had one replied she didnt enjoy the last time we had apps here I think it was around Halloween and First Friday either  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert We didnt deserve that  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone anymore  I even promised my Japanese friend who lives and works overseas Id treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit  Guess Ill have to find another place to take her  I dont want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai or from another server should we come back here  

Sorry Nobuo but I wont be returning"
5,"i tried the thai river noodles they will not replace the love i have for a dan dan noodle bowl but the thai noodles they were good

i like this place because it has really opened hours compared to everything else around here and the food in inconsistent oh also the new soda machines are very entertaining just watch

this is usually a last resort option everything else in the area is closed but it is a good one nonetheless"
5,What an amazing place  I had an incredibly enjoyable time staying at the Royal Palms Resort and recommend it highly  So many excellent points  absolutely gorgeous accommodations polite and helpful staff excellent restaurant breakfast brunch outside with a delicious cup of coffee is a must a great spa and a relaxing atmosphere  My boyfriend and I stayed here for a conference in late October which is a great season in Arizona  Our stay was a pleasure from beginning to end  The resort is wellsuited for special occasions there was a wedding reception and an outdoor conference dinner during our stay  Our room was very comfortable with excellent setup and a great view of the mountains from the balcony  The resort includes a pool a small gym several lounge areas with firepits and fireplaces and the wonderful Alvadora spa with massages facials outdoorfacing showers and shaded lounge areas to your hearts content  There are several mountain trails a short walk drive away from the resort and downtown Scottsdale is 1015 minutes away by car  In all a beautiful place for a special occasion
5,"This is my favorite coffee spot in AZ  They know how to make a fantastic Americano  They use very good coffee and a real European espresso machine  I hate those machines that Starbucks uses with the coffee storage on top and the preset grinders  YUCK  

The cafe has a comfortable and welcoming Vice  Everyone will say hello to you when you walk in the door

They do have free wifi but it is REAL SLOW  That is my only complaint  They need to crank it up"
5,"Can I review some of the people who go here Because I know one idiot who would get 1 star  But the park still gets a 5

One dude let his dog pee on me And the little bugger was fast Hed prance toward you and before you knew it his leg was up and piss was streaming out of his winky cannon 

My friend was tinkled on multiple times she wasnt able to jump out of the way very quickly since she was pregnant Did the man say anything Only that his dog was only nervous Are you kidding me

Alright I got your number In return we very actively encouraged our Australian Shepherd to play with the little terrier Why Because the Aussie Shep becomes a drool monster at the dog park and the little pissing terrier who only likes to pee on people not trees or anywhere else in the park ended up DRIPPING the Aussie Sheps saliva Sweet that was the only time we didnt feel guilty about her saliva marking other dogs"
5,"Unique atmosphere in the city of Glibert with AMAZING food  

Beware some weekends the line is super long but its worth the wait be prepared to eat outside in a nice shady area enjoying a farm like atmosphere

Good seafood is hard to find in Az  Farm grill does a great job also great burgers  

If you dont mind driving out to Gilbert its 1 of the best places to eat in the Phx area"
5,"my family and i hosted my sisters graduation sendoff here and it was a great event

debbie in the events office as well as the staff she sent us to be of service throughout the event were wonderful

food was delicious  we ordered buffet style chicken milanese sirloin steak appetizers and beverages for about 150 people 

the tech staff was very helpful in setting up our equipment for a slide show as well as providing equipment for us to play our own music at the event

servers were polite and accomodating to any of the guests requests
and the facility is beautiful

they even let me go super early in the morning being the type A personality i am to decorate myself and set things up

overall wonderful experience with this resort and its staff would love to host another event here in the future

thanks scottsdale plaza resort"
5,Went here last night for the first time in years I used to hang out all the time here when I was younger It was packed by 1030 Great music mostly top 40 and hip hopno techno yay Good looking crowd and not as pretentious and the rest of Scottsdale Everyone had a blastdancing everywhere Friendly crowd Reasonably priced drinks for Scottsdale I cannot wait to come back Patties still has it
5,"One of the most impressive spots in town 

Lunch here is a luxury experience  the grounds are amazingly beautiful and the menu surprisingly affordable Try this for an inexpensive way to really impress a business client

For dinner they will take your shorts though it is certainly worth it if you desire a truly memorable elegant evening Life is too short  try this restaurant soon

I have yet to stay here Royal Palms hotel  but it is definitely on my list of 1001 things to do before I expire"
5,"A few days after the amazing Yelp event at Brio I decided to go back to enjoy my FREE bruschetta This visit was yet again AMAZING First off Kimberly our waitress was the most personable helpful awesome waitress ever She was very insightful and suggested some pretty tasty appetizers Im not a fan of eggplant but she assured me it was todiefor She was not lying it was delicious

They also had the same live music as the Yelp event had and he was just the perfect sound for a happy hour date on the patio

Then to top it off the manager that was hosting the Yelp event came over and introduced himself Thanked me for going to the Yelp event and for coming back So hospitable I felt like I had a second royal treatment

Thanks Brio you guys are awesome "
5,"Our 1st visit to Renegade Canteen last night  We made reservations and were a little late getting there  but they had our table waiting which was nice because the place was packed  Atmosphere is very nice  Beautiful building and a nice layout  Next time we plan to eat in the bar  We had to try Bobs Big Burger and what a big burger it was  Quality meat bacon was to die for  Big onion big tomato  What more could you ask for  Mr McGrath was in the restaurant and he came by our table to say hello and ask if we were enjoying ourselves  Great guy  And our waiter was very attentive not pushy but always seemed to show up at the right time

We plan on going back for sure  Give it a try  You wont be disappointed

Catch Chef McGrath on Channel 8 PBS Check Please Arizona  He does a good job and watching the show makes you hungry

Thanks Renegade Canteen for having us"
5,So many flavors and the ice is melt in your mouth soft Add cream to make it a little better than a normal icey treat Lots of sugar free flavors too Mmm
5,"I was very impressed and surprised by the quality of this restaurant  This place is STYLISH  whether its the plush lounge chairs on the patio or the old school movies being projected on the walls  theres definitely an element of class that is rare for the Mill Avenue district

First impressions were extremely positive  the place was busy but not packed candlelit tables and dim lighting provides the perfect atmosphere for a date but not too much so that it causes that uncomfortable formal anxiety feeling  La Bocca almost seems like an AZ88 in Tempe for those who are fans  

I was pleasantly surprised at the prices on the menu  Most items were in the 1015 range and I was immediately intrigued by the various pizza selections  I focused my sights on the garden pizza which took me by surprise because it was basically a cheftossed salad on a really good pizza crust  My girlfriend went with the bruschetta planks and chose two homemade pesto one mozarella basil and one roasted artichoke  DELICIOUS

Top that off with a few glasses of really good sangria and youve got a really good meal for right around the 4050 mark  Needless to say we will be returning"
5,Stop here every time Im in town
5,"The spring on our garage door broke and we had no idea who to call  Lodi was recommended to us but they wernet specific as there are a few under this name  I choose Lodi Garage Doors  More and was stunned they sent someone out within 15 hours  They also quoted me on the phone and were so nice in setting up the appointment and calling back to confirm

Gene was our technician he was efficient friendly and did a fantastic job  

I will be passing Lodis name on for sure and if repairs are needed in the future I will not hesitate to call  Thank you for you quick professional friendly service"
1,"Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact Of course no one asked if we had been helped until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us 

Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server I know several people saw us just sitting there the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not 

This last experience was about a year after the last I thought maybe they would have changed I most definitely thought wrong We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time However our food took FOREVER Literally it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was 

Overall I will never go to that restaurant again"
5,"Fabulous Great views obviously of the city Very romantic Amazing wine list Superb service Delicious menu 

Luis was our server  great guy full of very helpful information especially wine pairings LOVE the lobster bisque Im usually not a fan of lobster or bisque Amazing flavor combinations in everything we tried I also love ending my meal with a perfect vanilla bean creme brulee 

Highly recommend if youre bringing a newbie to Phoenix or if youd like a romantic night out"
5,If I could give it more than 5 I would  Sweet Pea and I live down the street literally DOWN THE STREET from this bar  We waited for it to open for what seemed like decades praying that this was going to be the type of place that could become our local  It has exceeded our expectations  The atmosphere is amazing  The drinks are amazing every last one of them but the margaritas are the best Ive ever had  They tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside  Margarita Mondays 4 margs AND free food  Happy hours are amazing  New Years Eve last year was amazing  The 1 year anniversary party was amazing  But most of all the owner and staff are some of the coolest peeps that youll ever meet  Go here  You will love it
5,"This review is for localsthe Hyatt isnt just a beautiful spot to stay it its also a perfect spot to just sit and enjoy the day Ive done this several times many times for dinner and drinks afterward on the patio Most recently I decided to set up shop and do some work from one of the comfy chairs on the outdoor patio which allowed me to enjoy the gorgeous Arizona weather and still get some work done They do an excellent job of making the hotel amenities comfortable and welcoming 

For hotel guests if you are planning to stay here be sure to look into staying in one of the rooms that sit on the man made lake They have great patios right on the water so when you wake up you could have breakfast on the lake It doesnt get much better than that"
1,"I love Mexican food Today I ate half of a taco and simply had to stop not in a good way either The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor The tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper The beans were flavorless The rice was hard and lacked any flavor Moving to the vegetables shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable This is some of the worst tasting most over priced Mexican food I had had It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced but 10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fastfood taste 

The margarita was good but 10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side

The service was average but I found it odd that my waitress didnt find it odd that only a bite of each item was missing and never asked how the food tasted"
1,"The food was not particularly good on our last visit there and the service was rude and not helpful at all  I even emailed them afterwards to give feedback in hopes that they would redeem themselves by showing some good service that way  No luck  Didnt even get a response

They will not be getting any more of my business  Too bad because Id actually had a decent mushroom burger there before and would have been a regular customer  But the service last time was so bad that I wont go back"
5,"Ive been to this Dicks location a bunch of times and Ive got to say that Ive gotten more help from the employees in this one that Ive ever gotten from any other location

Ive spent some major time with the guys in the gun dept and theyre always more that helpful regardless of how busy and how many people they have waiting for them  Major props to those guys for good knowledge and patience

Another time I was there I wanted some new shorts for softball and they didnt have and Ls left but jokingly I checked the Under Armour manikin as he was wearing the same shorts and what do ya know L  It was near closing time and the associates were getting their stuff done so they could go home Ive worked retail and I know at closing time you just want everybody to bail so you can clean and go home  I asked a girl around the corner I was able to rob the manikin of his clothes and she laughed and had no problem taking him apart and yankin the shorts right off  I was so happy as I had a game the next day and didnt want to be running around looking for these shorts

Think Im joking lol  httpwwwflickrcomphotosryno4113416766

Anyways  good store always clean and everybody seems very nice and knowledgable in their area  Never had an issue there"
5,"I found some great tshirts for friends here including one from a local PHX artist with a grinning skull  

If youre a hipster or looking to buy gifts for one then this is the place to go 

Plus the clerk was using a Mac not that I would expect anything different but bonus verisimilitude points for fitting in with your surroundings Mr Clerk"
5,"Excellent wings I realized how much I miss this place when I ate horrible chicken wings in San Jose 

It gets crowded Tuesday and Thursday because of special deal on wings but definetly worth it 

They do not have any Native NewYorker in CA "
5,"The pupusas yes the pupusas are great The loroco with cheese has become our favorite But this past week I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad All I can say is What the hell Where has this been my whole life The soup is magical Huge chunks of carrot potato and zucchini with some thin noodles and a savory broth with some mint leaves I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic It was the best soup Ive had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago 

Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more Being magical you know it has serious healing properties Heres where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than 600 I was stunned The owner said it costs more with meat Believe me you wont miss it Who knew that magic was so cheap Hubbys fever is already down and hes feeling much better"
5,"I had a great experience  Nice people   My minnie poodle mix looked great and was happy when he came out   Total bill 43  tip including cut blow dry ears  toenails anal glands and teeth  Located in the Goodwill parking lot 

This is my first dog and my first experience with a groomer  I called on a Saturday and had to make an appointment for the next Saturday so they are busy

I asked the front desk guy where the pricepackage list was  He said they didnt really have a list so I told him what I needed and I wanted to know how much it would be  He went in back and the groomer came out to take a look at him and talk to me  She quoted me 38 and I asked how much for teeth she added on 5  They gave me a guide to determine how short I wanted him cut and asked me specifics on what type of cut I said shave him its summer  they asked about ears tail etc

I brought him in at 9 and they had me pick him up at 1  I dont know a lot about grooming yet but they said depending on how he was under the blower he might need to be kennel dried  When I came back at 1 they were finishing up his head  I can imagine he might have been a tough client given that he is still puppyhyper and not yet accustomed to the spa treatment  He was blow dried for sure His former curly hair was completely straight and soft  

The shop is no frills  No pretty sign out front and no decorating inside  I think they could make more money with some product around or maybe charge more if there was a little more spa feeling when you walk in but I will go back again for sure  

My poodle mix is 6 months old and this was his second cut  The first was done by a family member  My poor puppy went in looking like a mess and I didnt recognize him when he came out  He was soft had a nice cut and smelled great even his breath"
5,"Why oh why cant there be one of these closer to my house I would take them any day over Subway Their bread is fresh their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin This may sound strange too but every Mr Goodcents Ive been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke OkayI said it Judge me 

I do prefer the Mr Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street but this one is just as good"
5,Im a big fan of their strawberry water and if Im looking for a better lunch than what I have at home Ill swing by and pick up a salad from here  They have a good selection and its constantly expanding
1,I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews The service is good We didnt have to wait but I didnt like the food I ordered I had a salmon with caper butter sauce The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me
5,I think that they have the BEST pizza in town Way better than Pizzeria Bianco
5,"What can I say this place has it all Great service a hugh variety of food to choose from

I really like their pesto chicken grilled pizza but I could go on forever with all my favorites Check out there craft beers too

Simply delicious"
5,"Killer sandwiches and dill potato salad that set my world on end

I wish I had known of Berthas while I was in town for a long period of time because I would have eaten here everyday  

I went for the blue cheese roast beef sandwich which was a magical meal  Lightly toasted bread slightly sweet mustard mayo fresh veggies and the most beautiful sliced roast beef I have seen in a long time this sandwich was nothing short of awesome damn it was good  

As a side I got the dill potato salad this stuff is NOT your grandmothers potato salad this is what your grandmother should have been giving you  Holy wow creamy dill potato greatness  I am going to have to figure out how to get this out to me in LA

The deserts looked great and the little chocolate brownie cookie gave me an idea of how good the other offerings most likely are

Berthas is awesome fresh sandos salads wraps and potato salad that will redefine the potato  Berthas please open a location in LA I will keep you afloat"
5,"Truly the best pizza Ive had so far in AZ Reminded me of NY pizza thin crust and crusty I could eat this crust alone its so good  
In fact I did Ate it with a little olive oil and it was yuyuyummy Also had the antipasti so glad they actually give you REAL antipasti and not a mesh of crazy salad you have to try this place if you havent already  My husband and I got a small pizza and had enough to take home for leftovers and we are BIG eaters RICO"
1,Hot fudge Sunday was watered down so much You would do much better by going to mcdonalds This isnt the first time I should quit giving this place chances Im disappointed every time I once asked for hot fudge on the bottom of my sundae and was charged 260 more The staff is rarely friendly They should consider being friendly since it IS Dairy Queen a place that takes many of us back to our childhoods The array of desserts are so wonderful why not serve them wonderfully and with a smile and not like you hate your job and just want to go home
5,This is a fancy fine dining restaurant with a casual feel The food is definitely under priced For most of the summer drinks are cheap and food is half off for the all day happy hour to entice the locals During the winter you cant get into this place It is packed so reservation is recommend The food is described as American Southwest The best three choices to have for the first visit Is the Famous BIGASS Burger Green Chile Pork Stew  Lamb Fondue These choices will hit the spot and hit the wallet for 10 bucks with tip a person
5,Simply put this place is AWESOME  If youre looking to start a business or already own a business but need some of the details on a particular area this is the place to be  So far Ive only attended a Brown bag lunch but I was thoroughly impressed by the people who were there However dont show up with out being ready to put in your two cents its needed to keep the ball going I thought it was really good  I cant wait to go back
5,"I love Jimmy Johns  It is WAY better than Subway  The bread is what makes it  They bake their own bread right in the store and then right before they make your sandwich they pluck out the middle of the bread to fill your sandwich with goodness  

You choose your sandwiches by number but you can customize any sandwich  I usually get the 4 which is a Tom Turkey  It has turkey lettuce tomato lettuce and sprouts on it  I like their chips too  They call them Jimmy Chips  They are the kettle cooked type  I personally do not think this is your ordinary sandwich  The combination of bread and ingredients makes it a great sandwich and they are fast to prepare"
5,I had my brows done one month ago  Heather did an amazing job  I went back after 2 weeks for a no charge touch up  I havent worn brow powder or pencil since and most importantly my brows look TOTALLY natural  I give her 5 stars and would strongly recommend her  As a matter of fact I am going to go back and have my lips done
5,"Im not one for hyperbole but this may have been

THE  BEST      MEAL      OF   MY       LIFE

Id like to hold an awards show and give out lifetime achievement trophies to the following individuals

1  To the chef who exceeded my expectations again and again The Stetson salad wild boar meatballs and Koreanstyle BBQ short ribs and that killer side of augratin brussel sprouts and you sir have won my heart and my stomach  I want to fill a swimming pool with that BBQ sauce

2  To our server Richard  Your genuine excitement for the food was a nice change from past servers reluctant to give a real recommendation  You were cordial and professional and made sure we enjoyed our time with you  I dont know I may name my unborn child after you in tribute

3  To the pastry chef Country  Your bread pudding was exceptional but what a surprise your ice creams were downright dreamy  The scoop of brown butter ice cream took my tastebuds on a field trip through chilled fields of chocolate truffles

Thank you thank you for a wonderful birthday dinner"
5,"This Chipotle Rocks  
Today I express my joy
In the haiku form

Perfect fast food joint
Fresh delicious quick and kind
The price is right too

Burritos galore
In a tortilla or bowl
But wait there is more

Three steak tacos please
Or grilled veggie fajitas
Oh sweet perfection

A simple menu
Yet so many decisions
How can you go wrong

Answer  You cannot  
Order now you wont regret
This Chipotle Rocks"
5,Last time I went to Zinburger I was wearing a black dress and the hostess switched out the white napkin with a black one real classy
5,my son loves the splash pad His dad or uncles stay with him at the playground while I can run in the store or two that I need to There are quite a few empty retail spots hopefully they can get some new stores in there as well
5,We are picky about food because we try to eat healthy Owner and server were very accommodating and courteous They took time to understand what we want and delivered on it One gripe we had difficulty finding it because neon sign was not working We had a great experience
5,"I love this place This was the 4th and final stop on our search for a great dive bar in Old Town Coach House was just was the doctor ordered that is if the doctor had ordered you to find a great dive bar Im still trying to find a doctor who will do that

Anyway from the minute we walked up to the guy checking IDs it was a great experience Everyone was friendly and chill People actually talked to you and were having a good time It was a great mix of people

We played pinball with some guy we met who I renamed the Pinball Wizard I also found out that I am not as good at pinball after I have been drinking Apparently if affects your hand eye coordination or something like that Who knew  

We also had fun hanging out with some other dudes we met there and my drinks were 425 What more could I ask for Great bar great night"
5,"This is one of my absolute favorite bars in Old Town It is casual with really good food but plays loud top 40 music with great drinks What more could you ask for

Service is great and the bathrooms are clean The restaurant has outdoor seating which is great for people watching and right in the heart of Old Town nightlife

Youre within walking distance to The Mint Dollhouse Smashboxx and the Pussycat Lounge 

If I didnt live a 40 cab ride away oneway Id come here way more often 

Lots of huge flat panel tvs and plenty of seating It gets packed on weekends but the place is pretty big so it never feels overwhelmingly crowded 

This is not a good place to dance There is actually no dance floor But maybe that wont stop you or I after a few drinks"
5,"Have you not tried Which Wich yet Do it 

Buffalo chicken hands down my favorite sandwich ever in the world I cant wait to get pregnant so I have an excuse to eat them every day 

I used to go to one in CO all the time and I really remembered loving it when I found out one had opened by my work it secured a regular spot on my lunchbreak rotation until I realized maybe I shouldnt be eating sandwiches all week  I now prefer to hit up the AJs next door for cheap tea and salad bar healthier obviously but sometimes I wind up in the parking lot of AJs only to instead go over to Which Wich its seriously delicious stuff My husband love the Thanksgiving Turkey feast sandwich probably has a cooler name than that and my backup fave is the chicken pesto be sure to add bacon Always and I do mean ALWAYS get your sandwich toasted 

Trust me Im a fattie who loves her some good sandwiches"
5,My gf and I just tried the Oggie bc we werent super hungry  Even with that the food was super yummy  I wonder what would happen to us if we are actually starving  the sauce that came with the Oggie was excellent too so I suggested that you shouldnt eat the pasty without the sauce  The decoration in the store is quite unique church pews and wall and table deocrations  Its a must go if you are around the area
5,"Ive searched the world for the perfect pepperoni pizza  Ive searched it over and over again  Damn it man  Ive wasted my life searching and searching to the farthest corners of the earth to find that saucy cheesy meaty delite  Only to find that my favorite pepperoni pizza will always be Barros  a restaurant just around the corner from where I grew up



I loathe you you tasty cheesy bastardsoh and can I have a large pepperoni to go"
5,"Absolutely LOVE spicy pickle Sandwiches are great always make sure to get them HOT Pickles are awesome too 

Food is consistent and really good Good variety and you can easily make your own sandwich with a ton of choices Good breads meats cheeses toppings sauces Overall a really good sandwich"
5,"Another 5 star review I saw Beauty and the Beast with my little niece last night and she couldnt stop talking about it 
It was her reward for having good grades 
I know Im supposed to be the reviewing the theater but I cant bring myself to rate them lower than 5 It was such a good show that even though there were a few minor issues at the theater  they still deserve 5 stars The auditorium is starting to show its age and hopefully they get the funding to make improvements Also some lady with a big head sat in front of us and my little niece couldnt see so I changed seats with her  No big deal 
Other than that the staff were very professional and helpful as always 
Thank you again to yelp Lindsey and to Gammage for giving us complimentary tickets My little niece and I appreciates it and we enjoyed the show "
5,This place is delicious Great food and when they cook in front of you they do a lot of cool tricks and stuff I would eat there everyday if I could afford it
5,"We love 5th and Wine and recommend it to anyone that asks the appetizers and wine specials for Happy Hour are some of the best in town Lets start off with the fact that every glass of wine on the wine list thats right every glass is just 5 during Happy Hour from 3  6 pm

Did someone mention appetizers Yep 5th has you covered there too Ever tried Fried Pickles Love them But I have to admit it took some convincing to win us over thanks Scott The fried pickles are thinly cut fried to perfection and served with a creamy horseradish sauce for dipping

But what 5th and Wine is really known for at Happy Hour is their Bruchetta They have 6 types to try but may we recommend this selection of our favorites Apple and Brie Tomato Basil and Mozzarella and the Steak and Horseradish Its a great threesome As someone mentioned last night the bread is not too hard very flavorful and toasted just right

Read the entire review here httpschmoozeazcomblogp680"
5,very wonderful and romantic place to take your loved one 
5,"I dropped in to SweetRepublic finally because they tweeted about their Chocolate Guinness and a limited edition Jameson Irish Cream

I have had their ice cream in the past both from the truck and at other events and was already a fan

Now Im fanatical

The Jameson was amazingly good I couldnt believe how well the flavor was represented without having the harshness of the alcohol bite

But the Chocolate Guinness won the day It was so good I ordered a pint to take home Unexplainably it is still in the freezer I will remedy that today

The location is right by my work so I anticipate returning again and again

Jan and Helen are wonderful girls and they have created something truly amazing I congratulate them and look forward to more of their creations

And their commitment to using local ingredients makes me happy to spend my money there rather than a chain who doesnt concern themselves with the area"
5,"Tasty fair trade organic coffee and breakfast and lunch
Even have almond milk 
Excellent choices
Super nice people
Comfortable space
Lets help support these independent shops who exude caring quality and individuality to thrive in our community"
5,"The Great Indoors is a phenomenal place to get lost and dream about what you would like to have your home look like  WARNING  You will want to spend money

On average their prices are pretty run of the mill dept store style it is their selection that is amazing  They have far more selection than any other store I have ever been to  The store is also well organized and laid out and everything is easy to find

One final note while not a place for extreme bargain hunters if you play your cards right you can get some great deals  I just purchased all of our appliances for our home at a 20 discount  Again not the best discount I have seen but getting them all at once not having to look around and still getting 2 back for every 10 I spend is pretty darn nice

Oh and if you need appliances ask for AndyAndrew He is a great help and honest as can be"
5,Lots of awesome stores Expensive and normal priceit is an indoor mall  Has Starbucks and a Tiffanysmy two favorites
5,New owners are awesome  Good people earnest in providing a great product with great service  The restaurant is beautiful too  My mouth starts watering right when I walk in the door  Go check them out
5,Another excellent find in Scottsdale  The service is wonderful and the food is extremely flavorful with good size portions  The sea scallops and herb chicken are highly recommended
5,Absolutely fabulous espresso place The owner and staff are gracious and friendly but most importantly they get coffee I didnt have to explain how to make an espresso macchiato  they just made it perfectly Ill be here every time I visit Chandler
1,What a crap airline  If I could give them zero stars I would  I flew from Phoenix to Denver to New Orleans  The checkin people gate staff and flight attendants were rude and abrupt the flights ALL left at least 45 minutes late it was the worst flying experience Ive had  I was fortunate thta my Denver back to Phoenix leg was US Airwaysnever thought Id say Thank you US Airwarys for at least that part of the flight not being a nightmare  I will never fly United again
5,"This is one of my favorite theaters

With that said I suggest you prepare yourself for having to wade through an onslaught of preteen cliques if you plan on making your way to the ticket counter on a Friday or Saturday evening

If youre like me safety is a concern  Not to worry here  Ive always seen an officer on premises during the main dropthekidsoff  pickthekidsup window

This location still has a new feeling to it and it is clean and cool  Nice cushy seats with cup holders and I have yet to hear the soles of my shoes stick to the floor as I walk down an aisle

My favorite seats are the ones with the railing in front  A place to perch my feet

Swoop"
5,"This place is a bit difficult to find granted but well worth the effort If youre shopping down at the farmers market need a place to study or just want to plop down with a good book Fair Trade will caffeinate you as well as  feed you such tasties as quiches stuffed croissants cookies bagels and sandwiches  

The cafe was run by the church up until Julyish in answer to Mr Ks musing but theyve been bought by a few of the regular customers and are enjoying a slow but steady revitalization along with a steady extension of hours  Theyre also hopefully expanding theyre menus to include more food food items as volume picks up 

Additionally they offer only fair trade coffee and teas so you can do your part to help fair trade just by sipping at a cup of coffee"
5,"These are absolutely my favorite donuts in the whole wide world No offense to those Krispy Kreme lovers out there but I think Lamars has them beat 

Their donuts are always so fresh and delicious My absolute favorite is the chocolate iced cake donut with mms Just thinking about them is making me salivate  

I suggest getting there earlier rather than later because sometimes they sell out of certain varieties"
5,"This is definitely not your typical run of the mill nightclub 

First off let me mention that the decor is gothic cathedral style complete with erotic art bright lights and a chandelier over the bar There is a unisex bathroom that is very clean and surprisingly never awkward The music on Saturday nights for Doom Disco is an amaazing mix of old and new think Joy Division and She Wants Revenge Plus the bartenders can make a mean gin and tonic and they have a pretty well stocked bar for any other drinks you might fancy 

Tip Doom Disco also has a Facebook page where they post pictures and the playlist from the Saturday before Check it out

Overall its 100 worth the drive and 5 cover"
5,"Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants

A friend and I went to lunch there last week and it was even better than I expected after reading the other reviews  The menu is EXTREMELY extensive  The bfast all day long is a plus but I wasnt in the mood for that this time so I stuck to the lunch menu  I ended up ordering the half sandwich and soup of the day and my friend and I split a side order of sweet potato fries  The eggplant and roasted veggie sandwich was really good but huge and messy  I ended up eating a lot of bread and then eating the insides that fell out with a fork after wards  Delicious nonetheless  The homemade chicken noodle soup was outstanding  It had lots of other bits of veggies that are not traditionally in the soup red pepper green pepper corn etc and it added to the soup quite nicely  Did I forget to mention its a GIGANTIC bowl of soup  Theres no little cup o soup here  come hungry  The fries were delicious although we didnt even need them since our meals were Hungry Man sized

Some side notes

1  Parking is awful for lunch  If you dont mind creepily stalking folks in the parking lot and possibly engaging in an altercation with another patron attempting to park go ahead and give it the good ol college try

2  I ordered a water with lemon  I received a water with no lemon  When I asked for some lemons for my water they brought me out a small plate with SIX yes I really did say six overgrown lemon wedges  I tried to come up with a scenario where one person would possibly have a need for one entire lemon on steroids  I couldnt come up with one  There is no reason for one person to be in possession of that much lemon  Period

3  We walked in and staff 1 seated us  Staff 2 took our order  Staff 3 brought our drinks and later the pile of lemons  Staff 4 brought our meal  Staff 5 cleared our plates  Staff 6 brought our check  Staff 3 took our check and brought the receiptschange back  Did it really take 6 people to get us through a weekday lunch  I was mostly entertained by it  it almost became a game of who will show up next and what is their task  It was still a little ridiculous

4  Being a semihealth conscious diner I loved that they had fat free dressings made tuna salad with low fat mayo and just had many many more healthy options than the average restaurant  I appreciate places that can fix a good meal without drenching it in calories and fat  There are plenty of places to go for that sort of meal when youre in need  No shortage there  Its nice to have those options beyond the standard no dressing burger wrapped in lettuce or vegetable medley consisting of zucchini carrots and cauliflower  A big up for Taylors

5  For a half sandwich with soup half of the fries tax and tip I paid about 16  Its not the cheapest lunch in town but its worth what you pay for  Just remember that the portions are gargantuan so no need to order a lot of extras to fill you up

I will definitely be back again  Enjoy"
5,I went to Kens Nails on Tatum a couple weeks ago and finally found my goto nail place The staff was friendly and helpful and its a nicely decorated spa I went in to get a manipedi and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of service Mandy was my manicurist and she was wonderful I got the gel nail manicure which was only 30 and the spa pedi which was only 32 and amazing I am looking forward to going back
1,If I could give zero stars I would  I have never spent more time looking for a bar than I have looking for this And not like a cool underground dance club in LA  When we finally found this shthole sandwiched between two vacant businesses it was barely visible  The sign for it looked like it was written with a sharpie on a piece of cardboard and someone duct tapped a flashlight to it  Before we even entered the bar as my friend and I were walking up two redneck bikers whispered Fags as we walked by them  I dont think these were the kind of guys you argued with so I let it go  When we entered the bar I noticed several No firearms signs plastered on the walls  Im assuming theyve had a problem with this before  Remember that scene in the Blues Brothers where they go to the country bar and get the look of death from the patrons  Thats how I felt  The decor of this bar was interesting  It looked as if they got the tables and chairs from an old 70s Vegas casino  The place is about the size of a small apartments living room so getting a seat is pretty much impossible  We went to the bar to do some karaoke but apparently they also sell crappy jewelry for some reason  Weird  Ive also never heard so much cussing from karaoke singers  One of the drunken hicks actually got into a shouting match with one of the morbidly obese toothless tattooed bicker chicks where they argued who was the bitch and who was the pussy  Halfway through my beer my friends showed up and they refused to go inside so I ran away and never looked back  TIP If you go here wear a black leather jacket bandana and Harley Davidson gear
5,"Having worked in the Scottsdale Airpark area going on 9 years or so Ive eaten lunch just about everywhere There are plenty of good places but not many ethnic places Indian Paradise has the distinction of being both great and ethnic Ive only ever eaten there for the lunch buffet and it is AMAZING

I keep thinking that Im gonna be disappointed eventually But every single time I have dined here I have come away extremely satisfied and in dire need of a nap I keep asking myself how can it be so good Is it cocaine Cocaine in the food Is it

They have different buffet items on different days but the the mainstay curry chicken remains a favorite of mine On Friday there is a mushroom dish that I dream about and on Thursday they have stuffed jalapenos that are a little hot but oh so gooooooood

Be sure to save some room for the rice pudding cause its delicious"
5,"NOCA  wow

Have you seen the outer limits show where the chef owns a device that when placed in a small room with a single person drives the person completely insane with fear but creates a liquid extract that adds complete and utter bliss to food  That liquid is then added to  the restaurants soup which is revered as the best soup in the word  Limit 1 bowl per person

NOCA must have gotten their hands on this relic  Honestly  This has probably been the best dining experience of my life   Everything was delicious on its own all together or when combining just a few of the items on the plate  

Walked in and our server seated us  They brought us an amusebouche that had a small amount of blue cheese chorizo and chives  Was delicious  Then bread was served After that our Bacon and Egg was served  This was phenomenal  A crispy perfectly poached egg with oh so tender pork bellymmmm

My fiance ordered the butternut squash cannelloni and I ordered the duck  Both were amazing  The duck was so moist and tender but not greasy at all  We then were served cotton candy as we waiting on our 2 desserts to arrive  We had the donuts and the deconstructed cheesecake  I had an espresso and my fiance had the vanilla malted milk shake

All of this was amazing  My fiance wasnt in the mood for wine so I delved into the beer list and low and behold 90 minute IPA from dogfish head NOCA I love you"
5,"ALTERNATIVE

Thats what this place is and in the land of BIG chains this only could add some spice We were welcomed here to the free screening of Dale and Tucker Vs Evil as part of a Yelp event The personnel is totally committed to their project 

If you are looking some retro movies or the gender I dont enjoy but others do  horror this is a good alternative"
5,Dr Lee does excellent work and he and the staff are very friendly and professional  The best dental care I have ever received and I have lived all over the country and grew up at the dentist with my bad teeth  They work very well with children also
5,"This place has it all Fresh food Vintage decor Outdoor misting system for those uncomfortableysweaty summer days Plenty of scooter parking Beautiful shade trees watch out for scorpions Oh and did I mention the food

My favorite item by far has to be the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich Tender grilled chicken breast smothered in tangy wing sauce nestled between a toasty bun that has been smeared with blue cheese and crunchy celery Its heaven in a bite

Coupled with a serving of Sweet Potato Fries this is a party in your mouth and every taste bud is invited Even that antisocial one on the back of your tongue that doesnt know how to dance"
5,"After reading about all the other Phoenix coffee establishments that had either come and gone or were serving bad Costco coffee we were thrilled to find White Sage Espresso  The coffee was some of the best Ive had in a long time  Our visit was such a pleasure on so many levels and we couldnt wait to go back the next day  

First besides the fabulous coffee we were amazed by the multidimensional flavors in the spinach cheese quiche usually Im not a big quiche fan but my husband is so we tried it and I think I could eat it all day long it was so good

Next while we finished the quiche a batch of fresh blueberry muffins came out of the oven and the owner gave us a piece of one and again amazing multidimensional flavors  We had one of our own and took one to our friends who raved about it also

After that as we chatted with Wes the owner we discovered that he and my husband had gone to the same high school in Southern California another fun surprise to our visit to White Sage Espresso

And the last thing that really set White Sage apart from the average coffee shop is Wes is also a physicmedium  I had such a great feeling after chatting with Wes during our visit I decided to schedule an appointment with him  I have been to several other physics before but Wes brought something to my reading that I had never experienced before I really enjoyed it and I will definitely be in contact with Wes again in the future for another reading

I look forward our next visit to White Sage Espresso"
5,I was at Liberty Market this morning for breakfast The grilled bread pudding is amazing And the bathrooms are so adorable
1,Everytime I have gone in this store I have left feeling like a big pile of poop The staff is sooo horrible I read the other reviews and it seems to be a common thing which really sucks because I would probably shop here a lot more if the staff wasnt a bunch of pricks PS I found a skirt at Target for 10 that is EXACTLY like one they carry except they want 40 dollars and your soul
5,"My fiancé took his pediatric boards yesterday and that calls for a nomorestudyingatcoffeeshopsduringdinner celebration We are brand new to Phoenix and these last few months have been eating lots of Mexican and some more Mexican which we are not complaining about in the least but it was time for something different Our neighbor recommended RichardsonsRokerij as his favorite so I made a reservation for Monday night

We sat in their downstairs dining room tucked in a generous booth in the back corner My fiancé ordered a Dark and Stormy and we split a bottle of Pinot Noir as our server informed us of their 12 price bottles of wine deal Hurrah We ordered 2 appetizers the baconwrapped scallops and the crabstuffed mushrooms One bite of the scallops and we were in heaven They were GIANT perfectly cooked and beautifully placed in a pool of amazingly different dipping sauces You can never go wrong with wrapping bacon on a piece of well anything but this appetizer was magical

My fiancé ordered the Rokerij Steak with roasted corn and mashed sweet potatoes in a chili pepper Im not a steak lover but took one bite of his dish and it melted in my mouth Fantastic I ordered the Swordfish special with roasted eggplant and mashed sweet potatoes in the chili pepper as well and I devoured every bite 

What did it for me however was the dessert We shared the truffle with vanilla gelato topped with berries The truffles were like buttery brownies in a hard shell and perfectly portioned to satisfy Very memorable We will be back even if its just for the truffles"
5,I am so loyal to Durants that I feel like a heelbut City Hall was divine  Steaks sides drinksthe only thing we didnt have was dessertbut 1100 later who could afford it
5,Great fresh food and vegetarian options I will definitely return
1,"Sadly Im giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star  The Mangeroperator guy

Sure the food here isnt all that bad  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive dont seem to be meth addicted and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis  Looks like the crew changes over quite often and I know why

My beef is not with the crew members oh no  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store  Nope  The Manager guy the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint  That is my problem with this joint  Elaboration will proceed now

This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry  Actually one of the biggest assholes period  What a douche bag  Seems like any time I have a coupon this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it  Seriously what is it 30 cents  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used  I asked why and he said it was not legit why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead I checked the menu they would have lost 10 cents  Lady taking my order after PJL pussy John Leguizamo walked away pretty embarassed said sorry  Not her fault  Never saw her working there after then was probably tired of that guys shit  I dont blame you

Last trip here they have promos on their drink cups for free shit  Awesome  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free  On my trip before the last I got one for a free corndog  SCORE  I cash it in on my last trip and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket  No sweat I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog  Go to get my order ask where the corndog is  PJL butts in the middle of the order says This is your order this is what you have and was a fucking prick about it  Me the customer  Yanks the receipt out of my hand gives me an attitude about it  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that even at a low rent fast food joint  Fuck you  Seriously  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him puts his hand in front of the guys face and says ssssshhhhhh and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall  Who degrades their employees like that  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket  Instead of listening he made a complete asshat out of himself  It was a corndog what does that cost you anyway about 12 cents in batter a stick and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat  

Dude cashier guy tattoo on your arm tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job  No one deserves that shit  I am actually ashamed I didnt say something for you I truly am

What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is  My rant speaks for itself  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him  For the ones working there I will pray for you  You need it  PJL get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana they need midget controlling assholes over there  You would do great at that"
1,"Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour 

They have three lines tiered based on the level of players club card The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the lesser lines would be seated At the end we stood still didnt move an inch for 20 minutes So noone from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines 

What a fucking joke Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them

Never EVER again"
1,Angry Bro Bar   Please go here if you wear size smedium affliction shirts you will love it The bar is lame Kid you not there was not five minutes that went by where two people didnt try and fight each other
5,"Whenever I get my car cleaned this is the place that Ill always go to  Theyre nice efficient and they do a great job  My car is still shining a week later

The wait is very minimal  The staff works together fantastically and you can watch them clean your car so you dont have to worry about anything getting stolen  Yeah its a little small and a bit shabby but like the first reviewer said you dont go there for the waiting experience

Definitely worth the money"
5,I could spend hours in this place In fact I know I have There are so many things to look at and its way more than just books They have a ton of cards and stationary as well as fun trinkets If youre into used books this is the place to go Ive found nearly mint condition vintage books here and theyve made the perfect gifts The people who work here are great as well Theyre more than willing to help and offer good recommendations This is a go to if youre looking for a good read or just want to pop in and explore
5,Food is great  Really good deal lots of tasty food for a great price  My favorite combo is the Pulled Pork sandwich with side of Mac  Cheese  Coleslaw  Kool Aid  Founded by former NFL  ASU Football player they know how to barbecue I truly recommend everyone trying it out  The atmosphere is not that inviting yet the food is worth staying and will get you to come back I can guarantee
5,Yay This place is fantastic Great pastries and atmosphere I cant wait to go back
1,Gross repulsive appauling disgusting overrated dirty should be shut down by the CDC  You get the jist
1,"The guy who worked the front door Sunday night deserves to be fired 

Sound harsh 

Not at all Had a supervisor overheard how he treated my friend he would have agreed

We pull up in the car  It looks fine from the outside so we send in one of the five of us in to scope it out check the menu see if theres seating etc Normal behavior 


So my friend K approaches the guy at the door and asks what type of food is served here expecting a simple response like  American or here let me grab you a menu

Ready for this 

His response human food

HUMAN FOOD

HUMAN FOOD

K is just an average potential customer asking a fair easy to answer question

Okaaaaay Being the sweetheart K is she goes with it it him being a meeeeeanie and asks if there is outdoor seating

He sarcastically mockingly and and outright Dbagly points out how there is a seat yourself sign right nearby 

How was this guy ever hired

Again a more appropriate responds TOOL would have been yea the patio seems like it has some space tonight AND ID BE HAPPY TO GO CHECK FOR YOU or at this fine establishment its seat yourself but usually the outside turns over quickly  Sunday nights fine joke machine at the front door I could happily give you several other decent responses you could have said to an innocent patron

Everyone and their mom has had some turn at being a waiterhostessmanagerbartender etc etc in the food and hospitality industry be it in AZ SF WHEREVER and KNOWS the 1 101 rule is 

BE KIND TO THE GUEST
kiss  the customer is always right etc


Add to that list answer straightforward questions from your guests with flat out nonacrimonious answers

Granted this review can say nothing about this establishement beyond the front door because we never made it that far"
5,"My husband and I went tonight to teakwoods for the first time We had a groupon The place was packed  Different football games going on tvs all over the place I didnt mind but my hubby was in heaven   Hostess told us every table was full except outside So went outside turned right around because I forgot about smokers lol 
   We waited about 1 min and the hostess asked us if we would mind sharing a table with another couple We said sure  There was 6 chairs  and 4 of us total so 2 empties inbetween us It was same as if we had our own table Worked out great

 We started off with the jess Jess boneless wings Delish Not wet like other wings in fact I think they coat them and then throw them on the grill We Loved them
I ordered a southern thang burger  my  hubby got a Teaks touch ém all They were huge  We each ended up taking half home  Not just huge but tasty I loved mine    We decided to pay and use the groupon another time to ensure we would remember to come back

Great place waitress nice and friendly good food we will eat there again"
5,"I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now and it wasnt very difficult  Restaurants such as Rubios and the Blue Burrito just didnt stack up to a Chipotle burrito  Then came Qdoba

This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle 2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice  I had a chicken burrito my Chipotle norm so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible  

The food was great and afterwards I didnt get that punched in the stomach feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach but it tastes good so I suffer through it  

I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card buy 10 burritos get one free  free chips and salsa after activation  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle so I will be coming very often 

PS If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know

5,"My review is only for the purchase of a nondisposable diaper at this swim school As soon as I entered I was promptly greeted and asked how they could help me I explained that I was looking for a nondisposable diaper for my lilun and they asked about weight etc and found the perfect one for her 

The lady explained to me that the nondisposable diapers are so good that even if for some reason there is an accidental Code Brown if you know what I mean they will not charge their patrons They really believe in the product that they sell 

Their swimming pool looks nice and clean and this could really be a fun place for little kids I know they do parent and child classes here also"
5,Good works
5,A great value for a far superior hair cut than are likely to get from a national chain  We have been going to Tara for 3 years and she has created a warm and friendly environment that kids love  There are plenty of TVs for kids to watch a show if they are not big fans of haircuts
1,"I went here while on vacation visiting my friend Neither of us had been there before but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast so we gave it a try 

The staff was totally rude Before we went we called to check the hours The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information 

The pizza was blah  totally generic and nothing special If youre going to have mediocre food you better have exceptional service Double fail"
5,Always love it so good and good price
1,"This review is for the bar only
I had a date last week and was looking for a local bar to grab drinks at I called Cycle on Wednesday and was told they would be open until at least midnight on Friday and the guy was very nice Friday arrives and I take my date there and when we enter the bar the bartender makes a gas face and says they are closed for the night I told her that I called just two days earlier and she just stared at me No attempt at fixing anything nada One drunken patron at the bar yelled to open the bar back up but I was over it Well done cycle"
5,"This place has exceptional food and pretty great service for how busy it always is
I like it because there are quite a few vegetarian options  Before I started my vegetarian kick the Baked wings were some of the best wings I have had anywhere

Try
 Mushroom Party Pizza
 Roasted Corn Pizza
 Baked Wings
 Red Velvet Cake

Only con is the parking is kinda crazy"
5,Okay just let me say these guys are the best My family and I stayed in Scottsdale for 5 weeks this past summer and we frequented Baskin Robbins almost every single night No kidding And yes my butt thanks me not for such goings on But at any rate we have never met such a friendly ice cream staff I am a PITA when it comes to ordering my ice cream  I like jamoca ice cream with almonds mixed in then I like my fudge on the side and I like extra fudge This sort of ice cream order has raised a few brows and furrowed some in the past but not here not these guys And the couple of times my ricehigh from the sushi place next door son dropped his cone on the floor they were so kind and understanding about it they just scooped up the mess while they joked around with my little one about all the ice cream theyve had to wipe off the floor in the past with other customers and made him a fresh new cone adding extra sprinkles for good measure Viola No more tears and only big smiles from that moment on They really are the best I cant wait to visit them again 
5,"Im giving this Urban a perfect rating for it never fails that when I walk through its doors I always find something I want or could buy  even if its a gift for somebody else like my younger sister or best bud in Detroit I even found one of my favorite sweaters here on clearance for 20 I think this Urban has a better selection for women than the one in Tempe so if I had my choice Id come here to browse and buy 

Plus its within walking distance of Scottsdale Fashion Park Borders and Olive  Ivy the perfect spot for brunchlunch"
1,This place is a freaking joke Expect an overcrowded waiting room and at minimum an hour wait They see children but there is nothing in the waiting room to entertain them so they are all screaming and crying Theres not even room for a stroller Horrible horrible experience
5,"Saw this place on Triple D so I decided to give her try My expectations were high and when I arrived I was shocked that on a Thursday morning the line was extra extra long Had to wait patiently which when it comes to food I dont like 

But needless to say the wait was worth it because when I got in there I was served quickly I ordered the pork chop eggs and hash browns  The pork chop there is fabulous and the toast and home made grape jelly was good 

I would recommend this place for breakfast to anyone who is in the downtown area of Phoenix Make sure to try the bacon too"
5,I love the clothes and accessories the staff is friendly and the prices accomodate everyone
1,Huge line for incompetent employees who dont even know how to wash cars
5,Ive had work done by this shop a few times thruoghout the past few years My latest experience was when my sons car broke its timing belt and needed substantial repairs Bob informed us that he could move the car out of the way in his lot to be safely stored until we decided whether we wanted to fix it or not This is just one of the reasons why Ill always bring my business to him
5,"This place has been here 7 years and we have never been Are you kidding me The food is excellent The people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there which is most important I tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich YUMMY There are many choices for salad toppings There us nothing I like more than a huge fresh salad I chose to top my salad with avocado tomato bacon edemame feta cheese and whipped balsamic vinaigrette I really think this was the best salad I have ever had They make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing I chose the chicken pesto sandwich The combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl The sandwich was excellent My hubby ordered the Cuban pork sandwich This is one huge sandwich It was difficult to get his mouth around it but once he did it was awesome Typically we dont like coleslaw but it was really good especially combined with the tender pork We will return to the Market Bistro again and again 
Loved it"
5,In being a bit of a burrito man I was suspicious that a torta could ever marvel a tortilla filled with meat  However all of the hype on yelp and man vs food was appropriate as the torta provided a massive yet tasty introduction to pork turkey guacamole and a bunch of other hidden great tastes all in one sandwich  The carne asada quesadilla blew us away HUGE in portion amazing meat and super flavorful  I was also glad to be one of the few gringos in this place  People were friendly toward us in any case  Check out the horchata for some authentic aguas frescas
5,"Fair and honest prices  Friends and I have been ripped off by other companies for the last several years wondering if there was anyone honest left  During the summer youre at the mercy of the air conditioning techs and usually they take advantage of it

Im very happy with their service  Very prompt and professional   Father and son make a great team

Great warranty service  An electronic part he installed died after 3 weeks  He came out immediately and replaced the item for no charge"
5,So yummy Strange combination but great place
5,I absoloutely love this place  Great Coffee Americanos and Lattes  Try the Chemex if you are looking for something unique  Very Tasty Breakfast Burritos and friendly staff  I wish the North Location was still open but Ill take their brews anywhere I can get them  Skip Starbucks and hit up a real coffee shop
5,"Im a bit of a snob I admit it I generally prefer the fullservice pamper me kind of salons that charge an arm and a leg But times are tight  and I want my nails and my money 

Enter Biagio 

When you first walk into Biagio you would think you had walked into a fancy day spa But when you read the prices you wonder how they can stay in business A spa pedicure one of the most expensive treatments is a whopping 49 I say whopping with a sense of sarcasm Not only do you get a great pedicure best Ive EVER received but you get a leg and neck massage yes the chairs are massage chairs but real hands give you a real massage 

A spa manicure which also comes with a neck massage is 25 

The technicians are very nice the store is immaculate the tools are all sterilized and the treatments are very high quality even for a snob like me Plus the atmosphere makes you feel like you are at a spa not a stripmall dive nail salon 

I highly recommend Biagio I have been there several times and plan to go back often"
5,"I actually love this place and I always get great service when Im there The tootsie roll is by far my favorite 

I must say however that I recommend the Sakana on Power over the one on Elliot for some reason I like the sushi over there better"
5,Best cupcakes ever I cant get enough of the Strawberry and Red Velvet They even have a gluten free Red Velvet Order several to take home They will give you a ziploc bag that keeps them fresh and moist for days Im addicted Not cheap about 22 for 6 but when you taste them who cares
5,"Simply the best sandwiches I have ever tasted

The Mozarella Tomato Basil is perfect The focaccia bread is perfectly crunchy and slightly salted to the consummate texture

I wish I still worked closer"
1,"Really as bad as it gets
Crap food
Over priced
Ugly tasteless interior
Bad music and music system
Tired staff
This place needs to either have a complete redo or it needs to close 
I would rather go down the street and eat at Applebees and I have never been to an Applebees Too many other choices now in the neighborhood for this place to go on in its present condition Then again there might be enough people around these parts with really bad taste to keep the place going"
5,"These are some great cheesesteaks I have come here multiplier times and have never left unhappy The staff are nice and the food is delicious  
Also try the Cheesesteak Fries they are freakin amazing I am glad I work next to this place always a great lunch"
5,"I work next door and I love her  She has done an excellent job of slim fitting my baggy shirts  

Well she did ask me if I was gay but then hey given how animated I get about clothes I dont blame her for askin  My SO found this rather amusing and laughed her head off oh well getting back to my review 

I love nadya cuz she does a wonderful job each time She knows when the darts will give the slimming effect and when the sides are to be taken in Its never too tight and never too lose and she always always delivers on time  

I have been here atleast 10 times  Trust me my metrosexuality wouldnt let me let me go back if it wasnt a five star service"
5,Excellent food I do say the service isnt always the best but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations Definitely recommend ordering the Artichoke Salad Not what youd expect out of a typical boring salad Not just stuffed with a large amount of dull boring lettuce but filled with spices and tons of flavor
5,Jodi is fantastic  Extraordinary  After too many expensive yet lessthanaverage salon expereinces my hair has been less beautiful than its potential  Jodi gave me a very thorough consultation after I did some research to find the best colorist for me  During my appointment Jodi was professional efficient and friendly  I left the salon with soft gorgeous hair lovely color care of the INOA line and I felt beautiful again  She did what at least half a dozen other highly recommended colorists did not accomplish  Im ecstatic and relieved and I have finally found my colorist  What more can a girl ask  Thanks so much Jodi
5,"This location is quieter than the one at Arizona Mills Mall No screaming kids in your way The clothes are less disheveled still attached to the hanger but for the same low price I get my husbands work shirts here for like 8 Ross understands that there are still skinny Americans out there and they carry size 4 pants YESSSSS

I 3 the unusual house goods you can find at Ross I redid my whole bathroom and made it into a nice Victorian style in light pink and a wood brown They had this softgreen painted shelf that looked like a twisted vine Where else can you find something like that I found these two toothbrush cups that were painted with butterflies Worth the 5 each My bathroom is gorgeous Youll want to take a crap in there"
5,The Menu here is great  So much to choose from and its always good  No mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated  The Jambalaya is a big favorite and the pizza here is awesome  Ive also noticed that they have improved the drink menu quite a bit
5,"great beer selection
great live music
great atmosphere
I used to live across the street and nightcap it here everynight
there is always something to be had at rosies"
5,I LOVE this place I have been craving their Baked Spaghetti Pie again for 5 years and I finally got it today since Im back for a business trip I remember pretty much everything on their menu is fresh and delicious Their prices are great too Very polite staff
5,Best chocolate croissants EVER
5,This is my favorite place locally here in Phoenix absolutely great coffee Next to central highschool and light rail so there can be traffic when school lets out or rush hour
5,Best Thai food for your dollar in the entire valley Im no Thai expert but I have been to at least a dozen here in the valley Keep in mind  this is NOT a fancy place  just a simple inexpensive casual dining experience WOW
5,Love Love Love it The Frozen Yogurt is only 8 calories per ounce You can get your yogurt fix and still be healthy Also they run specials if you sign up for the deals Then they have a punch card program as well My husband loves going there because he can still get regular Thrifty Ice Cream
5,I love Tempe Marketplace and frequent it regularly  It has many dining shopping and entertainment options  It is an outdoor mall and in the summer there are misters and in the winter heat lamps and a large fire pit  It has stores that are usually only found in malls such as Tillys American Eagle and Victorias Secret but also freestanding stores such as Target Best Buy and Ulta  There are a large variety of restaurants and a Harkins Movie Theater as well  It is a great place to hang out with friends and see the local night life
5,"Ok I hesitated writing a review of this place because I like that its not busy but I want the place to survive because I enjoy it so much 

I hate gymsI mean LOATHE them From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while youre just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you dont look like you were already born on a nautilus machine 

This gym is everything but I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend Were both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim so we needed a pool 

As soon you walk in the guy at the front desk treats you like youre an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy Awesome attitude The place has never been overly crowded even at peak hours right after work Ive never gone during the early morning or lunch hours

No waits on the machines and they have plenty of them No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class one lane is left open to due laps Hot tub sauna and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub see Im not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for

Towel service locks and even gym shorts available no more using that excuse that you cant work out today because you left your work out clothes at homethey have some to check out there

Even the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body Note to selfdont do a month of the P90X with a friend think youre hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think youre all that now Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldnt make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up  Thank you unknown Water Aerobics lady You turned a moment of shame into motivation Oh yeah I will out swim grandma next time

The place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development Central andEncanto  
You can park on the street careful of the meters or use the garage The gym validates 

There is a downstairs weight room I havent check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job Yes I like this place so much I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own buildingincluding free personal trainerbut instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it 

I saw no young kids running around The clientele seems to be early  30s and up young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy No creepy people ogling you which you may be looking for and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmillbut reallyyou shouldnt have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anywayit is 2010  But hey to each his own"
5,"I started working with Second Chance FitCenter in the spring of this year  I went because I wanted to feel stronger especially in my core  I run and am a generally active dude but wanted something more out of my physical body  I had never done any type of personal training so I was a little apprehensiveand

I have REALLY enjoyed working with Heat  she is a great teacher which if personal training is anything it is a psychologistmentorbutt kickersaintso in my book that is a great teacher  

Case in point
A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was not sure if I was improving  mostly just my own mind being negative  So Heat said Next time we will try the very first workout we did  Cool  I was game  Dude  I blew through that sucker  to the point were I was like this is cakeof course on the second and third time through the sets  and I think fourth on this day it got harder and harderand I totally kept up  It was awesome  I loved it 

My Checklist  
Sense of accomplishment check
Strength building check
Piece of mind knowing I am taking care of myself check
Good teaching and patience check

In short I love my time at Second Chance"
5,I need to stop going here so much but its hard to stay away
5,Great fresh sandwiches The pastrami and caprese are absolute perfection The orzo pasta salad is spot on for the summer  Definitely a must id in mesathey need more central location for sure
5,"Excuse me How in the world have I lived walking distance from Cornish Pasty Company for over a month and have only barely heard of this gem Thats what I want to know

A friend introduced us to Cornish Pasty saying it is the best restaurant ever I best give it a try then right The Tempe location is smaller than the Mesa location but I LOVE its vibe A small narrow walking space between people sitting at a counter behind the kitchen and people sitting at teeny tiny tables dim lit lighting and candles and for the most part pretty good music 

My man and I ordered the Mexican Pasty and the Rosemary Chicken Pasty They were unbelievable SO GOOD The Mexican Pasty was definitely the better of the two but Id order both of them again any day A little heavy dinner action to make a girl feel full and happy I respect restaurants that have a plethora of vegetarian options What generation are you living in if you dont offer veggie options these days Get with the program all you other restaurants You know who you are 

I loved the entire experience and cant wait for our next trip"
5,Love Bagel Nosh The staff is so friendly and of course the food is delicious I have to admit that the pumpkin latte was no Starbucks pumpkin latte but the pumpkin cream cheese was amazing  I do realize its no longer pumpkin season I was just wishing I had some anyway It can get busy on the weekend mornings esp since the bike shop opened up next door but I find it well worth the wait Oh and fyi it closes at 230  so get your coffee early
5,"We live in Chandler so we get take out here probably once a month My husband is from the east coast and in both his and my opinion these are the best cheesesteaks around We love their spicy peppers they are hot and while I am not really a cheesesteak fan their chicken cheesesteak sandwiches are fabulous The owners are hard working and really appreciate all of their customers and let you know it 

We have been eating here for three years now and have never had a bad experience"
5,"Impressive   I dined at House of Tricks last week based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed    The aromas from others food while sitting around at bar let me know I was in for a good meal   I had trouble deciding what to eat so I ordered 3 appetizers   Seafood Stuffed Poblano Pepper Veal 2 ways and Braized Oxtail    The bartender did a fantastic job of recommending the order in which i received my food  lightest to heaviest

The Veal 2 Ways and Braised Oxtail were phenomenal a great combination of flavors and texture   I think Id put them both in my list of Top 10 dishes   

I cant wait to travel back to Phoenix to eat there again    Ill also add the I really like the atmosphere   Very chill place but elegant without being stuffy"
5,Wow that is some great BBQ  Probably the best I have had in Arizona  The pork was great as were the BBQ beans  I will be there again and again
5,"20 off with a Yelp check in SCORE 

They have very unique colorful and patterned vintage clothing for sale But what I liked most about this store is their vintage jewelry Theres a local jeweler who makes rings out of old school buttons and brooches I snatched up two really cute vintage rings"
5,"They have a new and improved menu and added more Korean dishes Very good Ive been there 4 times since they added the new menu and its been good every time Very authentic Korean food This is my favorite spot now 
The dishes I had so far
Champong Bulgogi Sullungtang Nengmyun Galbi Yukgejang All were very good I cant wait to go back and try other food Nengmyun cold noodle was especially good on muggy hot summer days"
5,I love their turkey and provolone cold sub Delicious with pickles added
5,Really good healthy food  Owner is super friendly Would definitely recommend 
5,"Im giving them a 5 star review for how they handled a poor experience we had  My family came here for my brothers birthday a few weeks back and two of our four dishes came out undercooked  We brought it to the attention of our waitress who brought the manager Adrienne over  They both apologized profusely and took the charges off of our bill which is what I would expect  We were polite and appreciative of their apology and really didnt expect or ask for anything else  However they also offered to give us a credit to come back another time so they could prove to us that it was just a one time mistake

We took them up on the offer and sure enough the food was excellent the second time around  Our server was fantastic Adrienne came by to make sure we were happy and the chef even came out to make sure we were pleased with the meal  They really went above and beyond to make sure we left with a positive opinion of their restaurant  Everybody makes a mistake once and awhile but not everyone has such excellent customer service to correct it  I will gladly return here as a result"
5,"I cannot believe all these negative reviews 

First Id like to start with the prices Dont get me wrong I love a good deal BUT if you are going to complain about how jobs in America are moving to China and India and not shop at AA because of their prices then you are a hypocrite AA supports US jobs and their factory is here in the states where they actually care about ethics and their employees And they have sales too I have been in this store more than a few times and seen 30  50 off sale signs And on their website you can shop the sale section and save up to 75 if not more

To the clothes  I understand some people may be weirded out and flash back into the 80s when they see the clothes here as I have read from the reviews on here BUT these clothes are actually very stylish and a simple top with a simple pencil skirt  from AA and with some accessories you have a fab outfit If you are looking for something not so simple try a white strapless romper with their petticoat skirt add some accessories and your done 

The sizes  I am size 46 with curves and the clothes from here fit me fine I can understand the frustration if you are a little bigger and have had a hard time fitting into the clothes from AA But the good thing is that AA is now coming with XL sizes in some of their clothing 

The models  I love the fact that the models are real and barefaced As someone who has struggled with a skin condition I always hate walking around the mall only to see photoshopped perfect faces surrounding me I always feel comfortable when I walk into AA

This store  I have never had a bad experience Always a good one i like the store the employees have always been nice to me I have no complains"
5,Mylissa has given my daughter and me the best cuts If you can see her She will take great care of you
5,"So I was introduced to this station about 6 months ago by a fellow yelper who goes by Amy D She has a wicked 810 spot on Tuesdays and I thoroughly enjoy listening to it on a weekly basis Well I was happened upon an opportunity Nay A priviledge of being a guest on this FABULOUS show and being the attention whore that I have been labeled I accepted  I wont go into HOW I found myself being handed this prestigious title of KWSS Guest but it involved a House of Clubs Twitter and a whole lot of begging on my part

There I was in the presence of 100 pure raw Cant decide which word to use Talent or Creativity and in a pretty bad ass studio The Fabulous Amy and I discussed all the important topics of the nationworld and stumbled on numerous great ideas One being a cure for cancer Okay we didnt discover a cure per say but we did briefly talk about it

The listeners were top notch and the atmosphere was professional yet extremely comfortable Plus we actually got some free talent from a caller He was awesome and sang me happy birthday  It was sexy

Thanks for a great time Amy and KWSS You rock alternatively"
5,Good choice of ingredients a bit out of a student budget but it was WORTHY all the way I was drooling with the flavors Good environment and good service and good music bistro style Im not much of a pizza eater but this has a good place in my list Forget about your papa dough or cheap Sunday pizzasthis is a real one
5,We stopped in to Copper Blues on Friday night after a Mercury game at the US Airways Center  Fantastic place  Unbelievable beer selection great views of downtown and an excellent band the night that we were there made for a really great downtown experience  Will definitely be back again soon
5,The kids love panda express  My 9 year old actually complains that they give you too much food This is pretty much the only non chicken nugget or spaghetti or pizza food that my 5 year old will eat  And to be honest I dont mind it either
5,"Oooohhhh baby I loooove your wayeverydayyeeeaaaahhh

I wanna be with you night and day

Went back to the swizzle last night and fell in love again

With pool
With dives
With football
With beer
With diversity
With the random atrium
With the jukebox
With life

How can you beat pool and beer combined with an awesome location a diverse crowd and a room full of people screaming at the TV because football is on Then top that with the weird quirkiness that makes me warm and fuzzy on the insidethe atrium a lovely bathroom and random bumper stickers at the bar 

The End"
5,"Fantastic find for delicious healthy food and good service 

A local friend said that theyd heard good things but hadnt been yet They asked us to check it out so we went for a late lunch midweek and it was still jam packed 30 minute wait at 130 pm We sat at the bar and received terrific service The fish tacos steak tacos bison burger and desserts were all delicious

It is an openair style restaurant where you can see into the kitchen All ingredients are super fresh and the culinary quality is extremely high given that they can make even the healthiest things taste wonderful I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a healthy food alternative"
5,This review is based on an event I attended here I did not stay at the hotel as a guest or experience the bar I was a guest at the Etiquette Dinner put on by ASU and affiliates From the moment I entered the hotel I felt welcomed Each employee I passed greeted me with a smile and professionality I thought the hotel interior was really cool also When I was leaving the event I thought how strange that locals never frequent hotels in their cities I should try it
5,Bad ass just like the name  Ive heard that this facility doesnt have any water restrictions so their course is lush  in tip top shape  Its definitely a challenging course  The staff is nice and the current off season rate is  35 for residents  You have to check it out its a great deal
5,Fantastic experience from valet to dessert Boyfriend and I were both very impressed We were graciously greeted the moment we walked in by a man in a suit who walked us to the restaurant Our server was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu and suggested some things to try when we were waffling between a few different choices Cheese trio platter was sooooo good Ill be getting that every time we come here and it was the perfect size for the two of us to share I had the beet salad which was very good Love the candied walnuts in it Boyfriend had the lamb which he said was perfect Tender juicy and delicious  The breads that came at the beginning of the meal were obviously homemade and fresh Even the coffee was good Its very rare for us to find a place that does it right so completely but I think weve found it  Service was fantastic Our glasses were never empty and we were well attended without being pestered Could it be possible I cant find anything to criticize I cant Love this place
5,"Wow I was in town on a week long business trip and the one thing I look forward to most when I travel are the meals Cafe Monarch was a highlight of my trip As soon as I walked through the door I felt cozy and right at home Chef Chris asked me what I preferred out of a few selections and I went with the lamb chops and spinach  Usually Im pretty picky about lamb and always inquire about prep but I left myself in his hands  Chef Chris served me a perfectly cooked thyme rubbed lamb with a wonderful citrus sauce  Spinach was prepared with garlic and a hint of mint which complemented the lamb perfectly  Simple fresh delicious

Just remember to bring cash"
5,"If I was on death row and had to choose a meal for my last supper I would include the New Mexico Skillet hold the chorizo from Butters 

I have searched high and low for any other breakfast place that compares to Butters and I cannot find anything I thought that I had found a close contender in Perk Eatery in North Scottsdale but a second visit proved that they were not consistent

Butters is consistently amazing The service is strangely fast but youd have to be crazy to complain about that Their menu is creative and there is a really great variety of food I always want to try the crepes or french toast but I just cant bring myself to get anything other than the New Mexico skillet Maybe one day Ill branch out"
5,Beer heaven  What dont they have  The staff has a taste for heavy body beer so if that isnt your ONLY criteria for great beer  I would just go with your gut  Their staff does know their stuff
5,"Great ambiance though a tad noisy food service and views For our meals we got the following

Amuse bouche
I forgot what it was exactly but it consisted of tumeric wild rice and a piece of shrimp Tasty and a nice introduction although the rice was annoying to eat with our forks

Appetizer
Bread with 3 dips  The pepper pesto was hands down the winner and the other two arent worth mentioning
Butter lettuce salad  Decent but a little too sweet for me
Lobster bisque  Very rich and creamy with a kick of smoky flavor

Entree
Halibut  Best dish in recent memory Get this Just do it
Roasted cauliflower risotto  Came with very tender pieces of beef The risotto was cooked well but it was unfortunately too salty for me to properly enjoy

Dessert
Espresso cup  The ice cream was delicious The rest of it was okay

After dinner we took a trip outside to take in the view We also explored the surroundings around the entrance but it only led to an empty lot with the unflattering presence of a dumpster Oh well

The service was great from the host calling to confirm the rsvp an hour after it was booked on opentable to the sommelier suggesting a great bottle of wine to the server making sure there was a candle in the dessert Two thumbs up

Totally coming back once it cools down to be able to dinedrink outside Woohoo"
5,Lots of cool cute and educational things here for my two kiddies I stop in here for each birthdayChristmas to balance out the junk toys I love the art project portfolio that is divided by school year and the school memory books 
5,"Great service I didnt get steak from here yes I knowa steakhouse just got the Zesty Thai Salmon The salmon was awesome with the chili mayo baked potato and asparagus Cant wait to go back to try their other dishes

Thank you Kathy owner for taking the time to send me the name of the dish Had to update this review and rating because of it D"
5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE I JUST CANT NOT GET ENOUGH OF NCOUNTER
the vibe is young clean and fresh 
the good is so delish I keep telling all my friends to go here for brunch "
5,One of my favorites The crispy chicken tacos are overstuffed with meatlettucecheese and always filling The prices are reasonable for what you get Also like Julios g  too next door for quick take out  or no Tip casual meal Self serve chips and mild chunky salsa  are terrific
5,"Hubbard Family Swim School has become a staple for our family You can feel the warmth and dedication on every visit Our kids love it and are excited to come to every lesson We even have birthday parties here

The instruction is topnotch and its evident while watching through the huge glass wall

Most of all my 5 year old is a much better swimmer than I am his father Thanks to Hubbard"
1,"I wish they had a 0 star option too

The service and food was awful Just a bunch of kids running the place  The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us  The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other The manager was too busy flirting with the other help We couldnt get drinks because all the glasses where dirty we were told by our waitress We asked for the manager before we left at 845 and was told he already went home for the evening What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place 

NEVER GOING BACK"
5,"This is not an Asian Topless Bar It is an Asian Tapas bar The guys I was traveling with spent the first ten minutes waiting for the show to start and were disappointed when I smacked them all for actually thinking I would take my coworkers to a topless bar 

Tapas are little appetizer plates and Sens is all about getting a little taste of everything The atmosphere is fantastic  eclectic moody and very very cozy so I recommend reservations 

The little dishes are about four single servings so youll want to order several plates Highly recommend the volcano flamed beef and the sugar cane pork The food is very flavorful  but everything is a bit spicy garlickyspicy even the dishes they call mild 

Plates run about 69 each and each person in our party ordered 3 or 4 plateswe were all full by the time we left Definitely get a cocktail their mixed drink menu is fab White Sin is absolutely sinfuland absolutely worth the indulgence"
1,Good service but the food was horrific The pollo fundido was dry  no flavor  Could not eat the tamale it was so bad Will not go back I had better Mexican off the neighborhood roach coach
5,By far the best poker room in the state and I have played in every casino poker room in the valley The action is always therelots of dead money to be picked up if you know where to look Good promotions amazing food served table side and all the sports games you can watch I wish they would bring back 612 limit but 816 will have to do  such an improvement over the tents though they will always hold a place in my heart It sucks cause I work right next to the casino and every night after work I have a tough decisiongo home to my family or go to my favorite card room and tear it up If you havent been thereMUST GO
5,"Staying at the Royal Palms has been on my bucket list for a while now because Ive stayed at just about every other resort in town that Ive really wanted to check out  Oddly enough this also happens to be the closest one to where I actually live so it seems strange to drop a load of cash to stay in a hotel four miles away from home  

No matter last month was my golden birthday and this is where my lovely girlfriend decided we were going to stay  Score  We had my party a surprise nicely pulled off and we invited a bunch of people back to our room afterwards to continue the festivities  It was a pretty standard room a bed fireplace a couple of chairs big bathroom a table and chairs on the patio I believe they call it a valencia suite  Life was grand

Until the morning  bang bang  WTF is that noise  bang bang  There was pounding and various noises coming from the room next to us and it wasnt happening on the bed  Are they really doing construction at 815am  It continued  My girlfriend called down to the front desk  The noise stopped  Then it continued  bang bang  We were about to lose it They called our room do you mind if they continue working  Actually we had just fallen back asleep

So this is not how the Royal Palms treats their guests  No any resort with a Director of Romance is serious about making their guests stay enjoyable so I knew this was not normal  A conversation took place and profanity and yelling wasnt even necessary  Essentially they were going to comp our room but they offered that we stay another night in the presidential villa for the same pricehow could we say no

I hung out at the resort all day because I was feeling miserable  They comped lunch and about 4pm they moved us to our new room  Nice place the presidential villa  Its actually only one bedroom but has a huge living room dining room kitchen two fireplaces three patios with fireplaces and water feature oldschool tub doubleshower with outdoor shower a bidet  you knowtypical amenities  I was still feeling terrible yay the flu  so we opted to order room service from T Cooks  Naturally if they hadnt done enough they comped dinner as well

We had an extremely atypical experience at the Royal Palms our first night I have no question about that  But they more than made up for it  They were gracious they smiled they apologized and they made it right immediately  I cant ask for anything more from that from a place that prides itself in its customer service  

I would not hesitate to stay here again"
5,"note the 5 stars im giving this place is for their happy hour menu not the regular menu if you order off the regular menu no amount of advice can help you



MS has to have one of the best happy hours in the world aside from Spearmint Rhino 3 drafts and a rotating 2 bar food menu such as 12 lb burger with fries hot wings fish tacos beef taquitos etc dont order the fish chilli though it tastes like A1 sauce they got a lot of winners on tap like kiltlifter guinness bass fat tire pyramid hefe etc



happy hour is from 3p6p and then again from 9p11p which is pure genius make sure you get your parking ticket balidated because the Eritrean girl in the parking garage will make you go back in the restaurant and get that joint stamped if you forget BUZZKILL"
5,"I love this place

You might ask why does the free roving large land mammal love a place that makes him sweat so hard that hes puked twice

And heres why if you can get me to yack during a workout from pushing me hard and coming up with exercises Ive not done before which is hard with 4 years in the Army 17 years of Rugby and 30 years of riding a bike then youre doing something RIGHT

My special lady friend got me into the idea of this as a good way to dog stomp one another via a proxy named Jeff Jeff is our trainer and if youll pardon my digression allow me to share with you about Jeff

We have this song in Rugby called The SM Man Its a less than politically correct song about a special person usually someone who trains us or who is a hell of a rugger himherself who is so sick so wrong that he makes pain fun and delightful 

And I use the word pain in the best way Pain after all is just weakness and in my case old pizzas leaving the body

Jeff is amazing He gets it done in 30 minutes to the point where I dont really want to do anything the next day Its in and out slam bam thank you maam with Jeff and Vitality This is going to be a part of my training for the long term"
1,I was accused of training my wife for compensation and was told to leave the gym or he Page the trainer was going to call the cops  I dont know how a trainer confuses me working WITH my wife with training my wife for compensation    Management handled this issue horribly   Their lack of attention to the matter showed exactly what a customer of 6 years was worth   You are treated only as a number  Do yourself a favor and stay away  I have since started going to a gym which is much more expensive but worth every penny to be treated with respect
1,"OMG I am so frustrated at this store I have never met such an incompetent group of people in my entire shopping life 

First I called Frys Electronics to check to see if they had a specific GPS model that worked in Europe I called because I live at 115th Ave and Buckeye which is about 20miles from the nearest store The call center informed me they did not carry that model but listed about 10 other GPS with maps of Europe I asked again those models have maps of Europe Yes and Australia too And you have those models in stock Yes What is the price range 100 to 300 Thank you FIRST MISINFORMATION 

So I drove to  30th Ave and Thunderbird talked with GPS Specialist which apparently means nothing and he Jared informed me they did not have any GPS units with European maps He said the call center is a bunch of retards and that those were all last years models 

Then he called someone and looked at several GPS Units When he did not know  if the unit had European maps or not he GOOGLED them okay not confident in your product knowledge Then he sold me a 260 unit with European maps SECOND MISINFORMATION 

I drove all the way home and the GPS did not have European maps I had to buy them for another 100 which I could have done with a cheaper GPS

So I drive back to Frys Speak with a Supervisor they return my first GPS I speak with the same sales rep ya thats great He says he figured out 25min after I left that he sold me the wrong product and none of their GPS have european maps 

So I then buy the cheapest model that was could download European maps according the the sales rep Garmin NUVI 50Lm for 129  THIRD MISINFORMATION Because according to the Garmin site the NUVI 40Lm is also compatible and cheaper 

I then went home bought the 100 European map and couldnt download it to my GPS because there wasnt enough space available

Now I have to buy a miniSD Card and a miniSD reader for my Mac book Awesome Great to know that the electronic store knows nothing about electronics"
5,Great food The French dip is to die for Great Service Clean and fancy especially for the area its located in  Def a hidden gem My husband and I both love going here and cant wait until next time
5,Amazing  The Chicken sausage pasta definitely works
1,"WOW  I have never been to a place with service this horrible  I may have caught them on a bad night but Im not giving them a second chance to find out

I came in with a group of 4  We stood up front for 510 minutes before waving someone down to be seated  That was a mistake

As were waiting for a server to take our drink order we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled dirty plates that needed bussing and people with impatient faces  There was only 12 dedicated servers and they completely ignored us

We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order it was like being in the Twilight Zone  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees we just walked out laughing no one had even apologized for the wait Im not sure they even saw us leave  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life

What a joke

EDIT  To their credit right after I posted this review I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation even going so far as to include their cell number  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews Im assuming I caught them on a really bad night  Ill edit this if I ever return to the restaurant but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something"
5,YUMMMMMM I was brought to this place by a friend and was so glad to find it Very clean and unique casual setting Staff were very friendly food was hot fresh and amazingly gooydefinately a 4 napkin kind of meal So happy to see they serve Chicken philly steak as well as the usual philly cheese steak and sweet potatoe fries Find out where this place is because it could be easily over looked and you would be missing out on some deeeelicous food This place is a must try
1,"Ive decided to completely write this place off and here is why you should too

THREE TIMES I have tried to go here and they have been closed all the while their website and posted hours say they should be open If one of you wants to drive all the way here from the suburbs youd better call first because this place cannot be trusted Ive wasted my time and spent hungry minutes walking here only to be disappointed 

Vitamin T will fail there I said it"
5,I am obsessed with this place  I cannot say enough amazing thingsI love their exhibitsI love Arcadia Farms insideI love the architecture and design of the buildingI love the staff they are so helpfulthe gift shop is fabulous I got the cutest watch bangleI love the giant red trex out frontI love the kids area or at least my son doesI love the diversity of the art  I would recommend getting a membership because it allows you to be able go all year long with your loved ones and family  You can have weddings here and they are beautiful  They have events here all the time if you sign up for emails or become a memberat least just go once and you will fall in love
5,"Im not gonna lie I possibly had the best sunny side up eggs ever 
A simple dish so rarely cooked perfectly"
5,SawThsic Sense Christmas show for the second time last weekend  Great show  laughed my ass off  Thinking about going back for closing weekend  
5,"The greatest community that Ive ever been a part of  Gilbert Crossfit isnt just a place where you can get in the best shape of your life it is a community of friends that share the same outlook on life support eachother in everything they do and truly care about one another  Getting in shape and doing things you never thought possible is just the added benefit of being part of this group 

If you are looking to get in shape live a long healthy life and have fun with a great group of people come by Gilbert Crossfit Youll never go back to a Globo Gym again"
5,"Thank goodness for Sue at Mill Avenue Travel We contacted Sue to book our honeymoon trip to St Lucia at one of the Sandals resort  She was great with setting everything up booking airfare etc  When our original airfare decided to cancel the flight she made sure we had a comparable one booked  The best thing she did for us was encourage us to purchase travel insurance  

When we arrived at our Miami hotel at 1030pm the night prior to leaving for St Lucia we had discovered Sue had left us an urgent note to contact her  We found out a hurricane had hit St Lucia and all of a sudden our honeymoon plans starting crumbling apart  Because of Sue and our travel insurance thank goodness we listened to the expert on this one we were able to change our honeymoon to a Sandals resort in the Bahamas and didnt miss a beat  Sue was in constant contact with us which calmed the craziness I was feeling and Im sure my new husband was relieved  The airlines even took care of our baggage fees on the way to the Bahamas
  
If we had booked this trip on our own we would have been up a creek without a paddle  I most definitely would not have purchased travel insurance and our honeymoon would not have turned out to be the amazing trip it was 

We will definitely be using Sue again"
5,"All I needed to complete my delicious meal here was a good Cuban cigar and some brandy

We had the Papa Rellena for an appetizer very very good Its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime sauce

For entrees my wife and I shared two dishes the Ropa Viejas shredded beef brisket in a tomato wine sauce and the Gallina Frita crispy fried shredded chicken onions in a mojo garlic lime sauceamazing

Both dishes were largewith tons of meat

Great service and really good mojitos make for a nice evening out at the Havana Cafe

For dessert we indulged on the Best Of Phoenix Phoenix New Times Caramel Flan OMG And the coffee was yummy too 

We also found a 15 coupon in DineInAzcom saved us almost 7

As the sign over the door says Cha Cha Cha"
1,"There were 3 cars in the parking lot and people walking to the door but the young lady closed the doors at 951pm

The young lady spoke through the glass for atleast 4 minutes explaining she would not open the doors

I live behind this location but I may not return There is a Walgreens off of 7th Street"
1,"I am writing this review only for the optical department I accidentally poked my eye with a branch yesterday and knew I had damaged it so I went to the Gilbert Costco optician and asked if I could be seeing on an emergency basis The receptionist asked me if I could come back in 5 hours to which I stated it was an emergency and could asked the Dr if she could see me She asked her and she said no she did not have time
I find it very unbelievable that on an emergency basis they can turn someone away who has a Costco optics patient for years I recognize that she had a patient at the time but I said I could wait until after so she could at least take 5 minutes to tell me if I should go to a hospital or not Dont ever waste your time going here if you need immediate attention for an emergency because they will not make room for you"
1,"Oh boy I usually LOVE LOVE Mucho Gusto but NO ME GUSTA today

We got a to go order perhaps that was mistake numero uno  I got the nachos really you cant mess those up Or so I thouhgt I mean Filibertos would have been a better choice  Can you say cold soggy mess maybe that was my fault I will accept the blame I really should have known better 

Mistake numero dos What do you call Shrimp Cocktail with out the shrimp Bad Service Lack of quality controlReally Really You forgot the shimp How do you do that Better question WHO DOES THAT

Mistake numero treslemme just say burned tasting chips as opposed to my soggy nacho chips and left an acrid taste in ones mouth and the most offending guacamole that I have ever had 

Let me just say that my co worker and I eat here frequently enough that we can order for each other We also know to order our guacamole with out the Grand Marnier galze thingy on top  

Mucho Gusto you mucho FAILED me today  I hate leaving a bad review without first compaining to management so expect a phone call from me shortly"
5,"Big fan of this store  the owner tries very hard to create an inviting atmosphere for all levels of gamers Further the store provides for a host of niches including eurogames Ameritrash role playing and miniature wargaming Good amount of supplies both GW and P3 among others Lots of tables for miniature gaming board games CCGs and painting in the back and a fridge with soda Theyve started carrying MTG over the last few months and that collection has grown Always something going on here but nothing intimidating 

The owner is very very helpful willing to answer questions about painting games and to make special orders even trips over to Gilbert at Battlefoam when necessary Yep big fan"
5,Kids love Disney and so do I  One of my favorite things at this location as opposed to the AZ Mills location is the magic princess mirror  Grab any of the princess items shoes tiara wand etc off the rack and wave the package with the UPC symbol facing the jewels and mirror and after a few seconds that particular princess will appear in the mirror with a little story for the kids
5,"This is one of the top three Dog Parks in the Valley Plenty of room well lit in the evenings plenty of water Ive seen the attendance shift slightly in the last year with less hipsters and more kooks coming in Not a problem though because there are always multiple groups to mingle with
For photos and a complete review of this park go to wwwdogparkriotcom"
5,"Ok Ill say this up front I dont like chains  There are just far too many awesome restaurants in PhoenixScottsdale to go to a chain

That being said this place is amazing and the quality and consistency here is unreal  Yes it seems expensive but once youve eaten here youll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth

So much awesome unlimited red meat

Dont let them trick you with the salad bar  Its killer but dont fill up  And dont be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on GREEN the sign of meat greed hahahahaha

Lastly try the Tres Leches and the Key Lime Pie out of this world"
5,I love this place It was so beautiful over the holidays with all the lights and garlands I think the people who run this have a lot of pride in their business The room was clean and the beds so comfortable The decor is rustic but elegant at the same time I liked how close we got to park to our roomsuper convenient Lots of coupons given to us at checkin too Great experience
5,love love love it What a quaint little piece of heaven Located south phoenixI wasnt sure what this place would look like as we kept driving south but as we walked onto the property it felt as if you were no longer in the big overcrowded city We went to the morning glory cafe for breakfast The food was wonderful and the presentation was great I highly recommend it It would make a wonderful place for a baby or wedding shower
5,"Wow Food was great But the service was even better We got there early so we didnt have to wait a long time  

Their computer system was down so instead of asking for cash or taking our card numbers they comped out lunch So impressed with this place And such a cool vibe"
5,"Whenever Im looking for a quick healthy lunch and am tired of salads from the grocery store I swing by Zoes Kitchen on Camelback For a long time I used to get the spinach and chicken quesadillas however last time I went in I realized they didnt have them on the menu anymore The manager that was on duty was super friendly and helpful and explained it was now basically the spinach rollups add chicken I must say they are even more delicious

Is it your cheapest lunch option Probably not Im a frugal person by nature but it definitely beats eating Fast Food So its worth the extra buck or two to know youre not loading yourself up with tons of grease and carbs Ive introduced a lot of my coworkers to Zoes and they all love it too Now if only they can open up in Gilbert or Chandler near where I live"
5,"Ok so I know that this private shooting club has had its share of problems with membership and maintenance issues but I have to say in the last 6 months under the direction of a seminew board of directors the range facilities have been greatly improved 
The members can enjoy shooting pistols or rifles pretty much all day every day uninterupted except when a scheduled match is on the club calendar located at wwwphoenixrodandgun This new fully updated calendar is really cutting down on the number of scheduling conflicts between match directors and members Also since aquiring new Range Staff the number of complaints about other members or range employees has gone way down I do have to say the range which is located right in central phoenix is affordable practical and overall a great shooting experience"
5,Really great food and service and it worked out just fine for my two kids ages 7 and 10 Meatball pizza was a hit for the younger one the older one shared sausage pizza and mussels The food came very quickly We had all small plates and pizza not entrees kale chips fried chickpeas peppers mozzarella salad Dessert was great The mousse was first rate and the parsnip creme brulée was delicious though we couldnt taste any parsnip it just tasted like excellent flavorful creme brulée One of the best meals we had in Arizona And we also really liked the decor Simple elegant and also funcreative Not sure why anyone would ding them for that Also the portion sizes were just fine We all left full but not feeling gross Were from MA and were unaware of the chefs celebrity I wonder if some of the griping here is just celebrity bashing or a reaction against some sort of hype Im outside that loop but it just struck us as an excellent and fun place with great food and no pretension Just thorough competence Note Its a nice walk from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel Under 2 miles
5,Polite friendly staff Great always clean place  The gym is great and never too crowded
5,"I LOVE this place  This is my sushi bar  Danny one of the two sushi chefs is awesome  I have always found their sushi to be very fresh

About a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu  With rolls like these Dirty Harry Mr Miagi Rio you cannot go wrong  Especially if you like spicy like me

Even the nonsushi is great  This is one place my 6 year old loves that doesnt have a drive through window

Also 450 sake bombs  450

Go here  Try it  Dont be scared off by a couple of soso ok 1 bad reviews  I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future  Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled

Almost forgot  They have some big screen TVs  Watch sports here  They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football  

Just go  Now  Seriously  Review part is over  You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here  You could be finding your keys  Putting on socks and shoes  Hell skip the socks  Wear sandals  Save time"
5,My friend has raved about this place for months so for her birthday the girls and I got together for a little pizza field trip to LGO It was amazing Just as good as Mozza Pizzeria in LA but around 400 miles closer I also love the little grocery store Very cute things to buy
5,"Sunflower market is WAY cheaper than Whole Foods and has a lot more than Sprouts Its my first choice of healthy grocery stores

They have the freshest produce around without it being full of bugs like Trader Joes Their selection is very wide and their employees are really nice Seriously I cant stand the employees at Whole Foods or Sprouts Theyre such pretentious jerks sometimes 

Whether I need lamb or bison meat coconut milk ice cream or almondsthis is always my first choice Theyre also the only place in town that has every kind of vegan sliced cheese Whole and Sprouts have some of them but which flavors are sporadic and random I will never stray from Sunflower again"
5,"Just when Im about to give up on my search for good Thai around Glendale I stumble upon a true diamond in the rough Dont be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel Much like that feeling the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door 

The food that Ive tried here so far is may I say it divine I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste Score I also tried some papaya salad and once again it was mounded in fish sauce and chili Splendid Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow which is not on the menu and lo and behold I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way To be honest the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce again drizzled all over your concoction Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre It will pay off handsomely"
5,This charming little place not only has the BEST custom spray tan around  they can also whiten your teeth and have a rotating selection of adorable summer dresses on the cheap If you are sick of being orange or baking under the harmful uv rays check this place out First time clients get a discount I will never go anywhere else
5,"The Boulders was a first class experience all around  

We stayed in a casita which was one bedroom and had a sitting room wfireplace a letter on the table indicated they are no longer using the fireplaces for environmental concerns a large bathroom and walkin closet and a patio with a table and four chairs  For the ladies there is a vanity with lighted mirror just off the bathroom  My only small complaint about the casita was that the shower was a bit small  The minibar seems to be a thing of the past but the Boulders still features a wellstocked version with a half bottle of Cali wine kettle cooked chips water soda and various liquor  The villas were outrageous and would be great for a family reunion or that type of thing  multiple bedrooms a large outdoor area for entertaining with the garage theyre houses really converted to a bedroom  If youre staying in a casita its a hike across the property to the villas  theyll take you in a shuttle bus

The bar near the dining room was wellstocked with several single malts and the standard cigar list  Walk out back through the seating area and youll find the pool framed by a gorgeous backdrop of a large boulder and waterfall  A little cool for the pool in December but it didnt seem to hamper others enjoyment

Looking forward to returning and enjoying more onsite amenities besides golf  My girlfriend went to the spa for massage  pedicure and seemed pretty relaxed  what I gathered is that she enjoyed it

There are places with cushier accommodations but the property it sits on is what makes the Boulders unique"
1,"I dont think I have ever been to a restaurant where I have treated so poorly by the wait staff Im actually rethinking my Green rating because I sincerely think this is my worst restaurant experience

The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables I really thought I was in for a great evening Oh how wrong I was

My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didnt want that table the hostess led us to the back Its not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening it was just weird

We sat and were greeted by our waitress who initially seemed very nice We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu Its just so small that I missed it the first time She told me that Friday night is the 4 frozen house margarita night so I went with her suggestion By the time I finish pulling out my ID my dining partner was ready to order We got a queso appetizer the vegetarian tacos with a side salad and the machaca plate

While we waited a few more groups came in were greeted and received their adult beverages It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink so I tried to look for our waitress 

She finally popped up five minutes later but avoided all eye contact with our table When she did see me she quickly ran outside I understand she might have had a few tables outside but why have an inside section to wait as well The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled Margarita was still MIA at this point

Then the queso came out brought by two hipsters It looked like an overmicrowaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad My friend tried to make the best out of the situation but I was ready to call the manager I really really regret that I did not 

Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita it was still MIA

Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was My friend cut me off and said it was different but okay He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some  When she came back I asked about my drink

With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the thenthirty minute absence she finally brought me my drink It was OKAY not worth 4 more like 23 

Two seconds later the food came out At least we had silverware

1 My veggie tacos and side salad were okay Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white iceberg lettuce salad
2 My friends machaca was bone dry Isnt machaca supposed to be tender rehydrated and edible 

All in all the salsa was the best part of the meal Yet one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto"
5,"We just moved from Florida and I was looking for a Restaurant with great food service and a great view to celebrate my husbands 61st Birthday on Friday It was suggested by a friend to try A Different Point of View We are so glad we did Let start by saying the drive up the cliffs to the restaurant was an adventure my Kia wasnt happy about but we made it AMAZING views Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief Greeted by our server  Larry he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef Nice touch Ask for Larry if you go he was right in tune with our special requests We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesnt like any thing on his rib eye and doesnt like anything else on his plate with the meat Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat See pictures to see our meals I held my breath until the plates came out and my Husband loved it it was perfect He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor and it cut like butter I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and it was tender and full of flavor the corn cakes were like little polenta pancakes they were delishish The bread and the specialty butter and pesto and goat cheese dips were also full of flavor 

The dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good The sun was setting and the lights were twinkling Just a wonderful experience 

I cant wait to go back when its a little cooler to sit outsideDont miss this wonderful casual affordable piece of Heaven"
5,Great experience at Citizen PHhighly recommend the food and ambience trust me well worth the price
5,"You know when you get a really good cut and color When the stylist is done and you look in the mirror and say Wow you did a great job It looks awesome

Well that was my experience yesterday I was a bit hesitant to go to the training academy but in these rough economic times every penny counts and their prices are fantabulous  

It is really hard to find someone that does a great job on your hair the first time you see them My stylist was Sara Groves and I am now a customer for life I have the feeling she is going to have a very lucrative career doing hair too bad her prices will triple in a few months She sat me down and asked me all about my hair my style the products I use ect The best part of the entire experience was that she really listened to me and cut my hair exactly how I asked I wanted peekaboo highlights in my bangs and even though she thought it was an odd choice and asked me if I was sure a few times  she gave them to me I was extremely pleased with both my cut and color When the receptionist rang me up I almost couldnt believe the price Cut and color for under 50 WOW"
5,I love the story time program here I started coming this summer after having a baby and wanting to get my toddler out of the house while beating the heat The staff here is amazing It is a 30 minute session of singing dancing stories and bubbles We look forward to this every week now My daughter loves the take home cut out and coloring sheet The first thing she does is come home and color it I am so thankful for this free program
5,Super cool cookiecakechocolate maker haven    Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had  it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness  I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything  Super neat place  
5,ouchhmy fuckin head is pounding this morning  thanks a lot guys
5,"God Bless Lifetime Fitness

First off let me tell you how much I despise working out  Like at times Id rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper  

However LTF have you noticed that I like to abbreviate  Get used to it friends  makes my gym experience fairly painless  Steve W I salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine workout establishment and I actually have many of the same opinions But because I like to hear myself talk Ill reiterate some of my favorite points

First off Im absolutely not a fan of children  Especially at a gym  Lifetime has FREE childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming  Kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool complete with waterslides and some kidspecifc water fountain spray thing  They love it  And I do too  WATERSLIDES  I mean come on  LoveitLoveit

Lifetimes members span the board which is nice because I like the fact that Im not the most out of shape person there  I also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper  You may even see a professional athelete or TV personality on occasion  Who doesnt love that

You never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines  And they are not covered in meathead sweat which is always nice

My favorite part of LTF is the group classes  Excellent teachers classes every day of the week and a good variety of options  Id like to see more coreographed classes like HipHop but whatever Kickboxing Jam is pretty damn close   

Locker rooms are always spotless towel service is free sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute  Ingenious  

Ive been a member of a ton of Scottsdale gyms but I drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the Tempe LTF  Doesnt road rage burn calories anyway  Winwin situation"
5,One of our Lexus car keyskey fob was cracked and needed to be replaced Going to the dealer would be anywhere from 250400 I found Alcatraz on Yelp and called Todd Todd did exactly what he said had to be done and the charge was 7500 Todd is knowledgeable and knows what he is doing Most other locksmiths couldnt do the job because they dont have the machine necessary to fabricate the key I am a home inspector in the Phoenix metro area and before I left with my new key I took more than a few of Todds business cards that I plan to give to my clients so that when they move into their new home they can call someone who is reliable knowledgeable and trustworthy to help with their home security  Thanks Yelp as I found Alcatraz on your site
5,I love sakana They have the best lunch time happy hour Its always delicious and seriously reasonably priced 
5,Hard to find New York pizza that tastes like New York pizza  All the way from Morristown NJ this place is now the only place I order NY style pizza
5,I was here for the Yelp event recently and loved it  The facility was great and Yelp did a good job putting together the event  I noticed there was a lot to do there  I am already planning to come back with my nephews so I can have fun walking around the mock grocery store  Im also looking forward to racing my nephews through the car wash on tricycles  Bring energy when you come and prepare to have fun
1,Empty tables Told 15 minute wait Ok 5 minutes into wait by the door bumping elbows with counter patrons 2 people at the counter complained they had been there 20 minutes We left at that point
1,Not a company to do business with  From my experience 
1,I wouldnt send my worst enemy to this place
1,"I do enjoy a good bowl of Pho   This was not a good bowl of pho

grey chicken meat off tasting broth old bean sprouts 1 piece of a jalepeno pepper dingy insides  Weird looks from the server  I dont think Ill be back  Not much else I can say"
5,Had a bad day yesterday and decided my healthconscious lunch would not cut it as far as getting me through my work day Ive always loved VSC  have had their menu at my desk but I hadnt been in a while Put an order together w some co workers  called I was read to go pick it up but then they told me THEY DELIVER I dont believe they did the last time Id been there Went out on a limb  tried the Dead Head wrap  soooo good and WELL worth the price bc its huge I almost took off a star bc their pasta salad is NOT what it used to be I dont know if they changed it or if they are just inconsistent in making it but it was kind of embarrassing that Id told my coworkers how awesome it was just to have it come out not so great
5,What can I say I love AJs especially the Boulangerie or coffee bar  Jason is the best   The pineapple ice tea with a slice of pineapple is delish with a yummy cheese croissant  I admit I usually get something from the coffee bar and bistro more so than the actual grocery store  Oh and if you go check out the displaydecorations they are usually pretty cool
5,"Well what can I say about this place  The restaurant is located in an upscale commercial complex with boutiques and an AJs in the middle of Arrowhead Ranch  Definitely doesnt have the boring suburban feel which you get along Bell Road only a mile away  The inside has exposed brick on the walls with sleek looking seating  Each food item comes out looking like a self made creation from the chef  I have to say the Marguerite pizza is one of my favorites  Having a crispy crust and savory flavors that make my mouth want to eat more more and more  But I dont need to eat more because I fill my mouth with a good wine  I had  a Dutton Estate ChardonnayI think which was half off on this day which kept me happy  This place did not fail me
So will I be back  Umm thats a yes"
1,"Most horrible buffet I have ever been to

My boyfriend and I are big chinese buffet fans A ton of them have raised their prices recently and not surprisingly have been closing down left and right so the prospect of a good buffet at 58 dollars was absolutely amazing We read all the reviews on yelp and I had high hopes

Dear lord The food is awful here Inedible Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner  The only thing I remember being remotely foodlike was some kind of beef and onion dish which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak not exactly asian fare

I tried really hard to like this place My boyfriend didnt like any of it either I dont understand how they have such good ratings The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt It always annoyed me how so many buffets dont even have sprinkles so theyve got that going for them though I think Ill just go to Mojo or Yogurtland haha

In short I dont understand how anyone can eat this garbage"
5,"Fantastic  Absolutely fantastic  I recommend OHSO for anyone looking to dine at a neighborhood bar and grill 

I was really shocked when I dined at OHSO for a Sunday brunch  I figured the variety of beers would be the focal point of the brewery boy was I wrong  This place has some of the best dishes in Scottsdale supported by a huge selection of beer  

Let me say this with more clarity great food differentiates this place not the huge variety of beers  This is a great achievement considering many breweries focus on providing rare beers with mediocre food  

The Burger  Cheese is simply awesome  
A GREAT brunch dish is the Breakfast Burrito as well as the Breakfast Flatbread"
5,These guys are great  They have helped me with bulbs needs for both my home and office  Easy to work with and good prices  Thanks
5,One of my favorite places  to get Indian food Im vegan so I love that there is so much  to choose from My all time favorite is the chili gobi and vegetable manchurian Im so glad Udupi reopened
1,I suppose you could just put me in the box with Luis T on 32010because if i didnt know any better his could have been my entry So i was here this week  Let me start by saying i have been giving Los Dos Molinos my  business for almost 20 years now and each year that goes by i find myself saying that i am going to cease my patronage  I will save the stories from the recent years and why ive been feeling this way and give you just the specifics from my most recent visit  If you want to make the rule that there are No Split Checks then can you AT THE VERY LEAST get with the current times and make the bill somewhat decipherable  We had a large party and were quite promptly advised there were no split checks yet at the end of the night we were left with a ribbon of calculator tape with ONLY prices and no correlation with actual menu itemsso we had to cross reference the menu to figure out what the heck all the itemizations correlated to   And by the end of it we pretty much gave up and just guessed at what each person should contribute because the receipt may have just as well been in morse code  Ok im getting ahead of myselfIts one thing if you have subpar service and the restaurant is slammed understaffed there is a MLB baseball game or NBA basketball game or concert going onThis was not the case  We were the ONLY table inside the restaurant and the service absolutely sucked  How many times must one flag down the server for take your pick A  refill on chips B refill on ice water and Cmost importantly since the drinks are marked up 300 a FRESH DRINK Oh yes and D Check please  We had to look over our shoulders for A  B C and D  When our table collectively decided the service was ridiculous we decided the tip would reflect that and then we realized an 18 gratuity was includedwell no wonder  When that is the case there is NO incentive for decent service We brought several items to the attention of the bald headed caucasian man who may have been a manager of some sort but his severe lack of customer service skills merely resulted in him stating in a childish voice They are complaining about the service to an audience that didnt exist  Damn right and damn right we will take our business elsewhere  Grandma Chavez is rolling in her grave you should be ashamed
5,"Market Bistro never leaves me disappointed The people are great
The food is ALWAYS good  it doesnt matter what you get they will cater to your needs  wants

Definitely a must if your coming to Phoenix or if you live here you need to try it"
5,"Wow  I regress into some sort of 90s Valley Girl stereotype when chirping in delight over how good Switch is How I was missing  a review for a Short List restaurant that I recommend to everyyyyy one I meet who is new to Phoenix and even remotely cool

Switch is reliably good food served in a reliably good atmosphere by reliably good servers The combination of service setting and grub makes Switch a goto for affordable dining that has appeal for a wide variety of people If I think that someone might be too uptight or too culinarily safe to really enjoy Fez I know that I can take them to Switch they can hone in on comfort food basics and I will still have an enjoyably awesome dining experience myself because all the basics are done with love care and actual effort 

I think I prefer Switchs menu to Fezs because of the combination of classic choices mixed in with flavor play and more diverse fare And we end up at Switch a lot because they have awesome outdoor loungey space which works for friends who are smokers and for a quieter more intimate chic and cool dinnerdrinks and gossip night 

Its really a gift to have this place in Downtown and a real gem in the Valley overall

We have on occasion had our asses kicked by the bar specifically by the Drunken Italian Sodas which are so very very good"
5,Love their pizza and atmosphere Their Caesar salad is really good too They had a great deal during the summer where we got 2 salads 1 large pepperoni pizza and a bottle of wine for 40
5,"I recommend making OpenTable reservations as this place is small 
I had a great dining experience and I enjoyed the drinks and food Margaret sp was a great server

I like to dine at local places like this particularly those that make their drink mixes in house and use locally sourced food when possible

The drinks I had were great Aloe Arizona The Kingston Rum Punch and Piña Colada Redux

I had a dish with red snapper and vegetables which was excellent I had rice and peas on the side the rice was not the best however it seemed too dry
My friend had the prawns I did not taste it but the presentation looked good She also had the coconut water which was served in a coconut  it was great and she mentioned it complimented the prawn dish

For desert I had a Créme Brûlée made with pineapple and rum"
5,Fantastic place  we went tonight for my friends birthdaythey were able to seat 15 of us without a problem  Our waiter Tim was fantastiche split the checks for everyone before we even asked  They gave the birthday girl two pieces of delicious dessert on the house  The food was greatwe were all surprised by how large the portions were for the price  Everyone was very polite and accommodating I look forward to going back
5,This place is the truth It is easily one of the absolute best spots in Phoenix for Sonoran style Mexican cuisine The chile colorado is so good it made me try to slap my mama The red sauce with the chips is actually brewed in the sixth level of hell Awesome Fridays feature 199 margaritas before 7 pm Swing by start with the cheese crisp grab any combo and revel in the gluttony
5,"We enrolled our son in this program It was EXCELLENT Of our three children who have learned to drive we have observed that he is the most safety conscious and the best new licensed driver

Thank you Driving MBA for the peace of mind you have given us"
5,I love this place The food is clearly made with love and the folks there are so inviting and warm  Great vibe Great food Great price You can bet the next time I visit Phoenix Ill be coming back to Tinys 
5,Kind of surprised myself but I have to give them a five  Lets begin with the drink was excellent  I had some kind of pom martini that was one of the best Ive had in a while  I ordered the sirloin steak cobb salad  My salad arrived two minutes after the people I was eating with and it was taken off the billthey also brought us a free dessert and apologizedreally  Thats good service  They may have even gone overboard but I didnt complain  The food itself was excellent  I loved my salad and it was a nice size portion  All in all a great experience
5,Awesome carne asada veggie taco and just about everything else  Delicious and very easy on my wallet
5,"This is the best record store in Tempe hands down  Second best in the Valley after Tracks in Wax  

I have been collecting records for almost 30 years now and have been going to Eastside for about half that time  at least since I could conveniently drive out to the east valley and regularly since I moved to this end of town about 10 years ago  I remember the fish tank with the moray eel and the fact that the plaza they are in used to let them have twice the space

It amazes me that they have survived all this time  And boy am I glad they have  A good chunk of my collection and even my current turntable has come from here  

If I ever won the lottery I would probably spend enough money in one day here to keep the place in business for another few decades  Heck Id even buy them a bigger place if I could  This is one of the last truly independent record stores  Im happy to support them and I hope everyone else will continue to do so as well

Edit They closed down on 123110  Im going to miss them  Hopefully theyll reopen somewhere else even if it is only online  My regret is that I didnt have enough money to do one final run through there"
1,Not recommended if youre not white For me its the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like DB bowling lanes are better
1,"Lets talk about failure baby

Hey if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic industrial vinaigrette youve found just the right place to BDSM your tongue Go for it

I ordered Capellini Checca and I had it substituted with Spaghetti I like more girth re pasta  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldnt be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes these had the texture and taste of a dying horses ass moreso than fresh produce  The faint acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb and motherfk respectable Checca should have more than 116 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil  

This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom  Hell this place is the  disowned crackedout junkie brother of OSF Its really that terrible

I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for"
5,"This place is awesome 

A cornish pasty is like a big calzone stuffed with whatever you choose They have many choices and all regular choices are also available as vegetarian entrees These are HUGE so come hungry Their tomato soup is also good but I would definitely stick to a pasty if you want a delicious meal

The place is pretty divey but in a really great way I have also heard they are expanding so those of you who have complained about their cramped quarters may find some reprieve soon Personally I like the small dark divey feel

They also serve Rogue beer which is delicious if you havent tried it 

I like this place so much I eat there whenever I am in the area which has prevented me from trying many other places nearby but I cant seem to bring myself not to go to Cornish as it is so good every time

Highly recommend it if you are in the area"
5,"Huge fan of Bikram yoga Its a 90 minute torturousattimes sweatfilled  workout but when you are done you feel insanely amazing The feeling continues throughout the day leaving you in complete zenRoad rage Gone Annoying food cravings Zero Jeans Fitting awesome You really must try it it can completely change your body

There are a few places in the valley that offer Bikram most of them exclusively rather than in combo with other methods of yoga The Bikram Institute on Miller and Indian School is where I first tried it and I like it the best so far They offer classes throughout the day and later in the evening as well Like other studios this place offers first timers a weeklong pass for around 20 What I really like about this studio is their instructors and the fact that they keep their room darkened throughout the entire practice Ive have been going to another studio lately for their firsttime student deals and their instructors bark out instructions nonstop plus they keep the lights on the whole time So when youre staring up lying in your relaxed state your eyes meet the glare of the fluorescent 

Ill very likely return here after Ive exhausted the new student deals at the studios around the valley Yoga can be expensive"
5,Excellent food and service
5,"GREAT PLACE TO HANG OUT AND WATCH THE SCENERY
With a little help you can drink  choose from about 25 beers 8 scothes10 whiskeys8 Really good tequilas just ask me along with the every day vodkas  some pretty impresive wines or whines
Dont miss this little gem in the rough  com listen to music or watch sports or just drink Oh yea the owners are OK also"
5,Love this place  Great staff  Friendly fun and knowledgable  The food is always good
5,"What started out as a simple attempt to find a perfect birthday present turned into a lifelong relationship with a fantastic jeweler 
I wanted to get my fiancé girlfriend at that time a simple diamond pendant necklace for her birthday and could not find anything that even came close to matching her style I searched the internet for days and reluctantly went into a few jewelry stores hoping for the best but expecting the worst I like most people guys out there had a bad feeling in a few stores I went to Pushy sales people looking for the upsale and sky high prices I was getting very discouraged about the process but that all changed when I came to Hyde Park 
The super friendly staff made everything easy for me There was no pushy sales process or anyone trying to upsell me something I didnt want They immediately offered me a bottle of water and started to talk to me like a real person After a few minutes of speaking with a very lovely woman in the store she suggested we think about something custom At first  I was thinking here we go this is where I am going to get stuck but I was all wrong
We looked a few loose stones and I got a great education about diamonds I went home later that night and did some research on the internet and found that the prices we as good or better than any of the big online retailers I could never get my head wrapped around buying a diamond online sight unseen and I am so glad that I found Hyde Park 

In the end I have used Hyde Park to create a custom pendant diamond necklace that my fiancé absolutely loves it is perfect on her and I also used Hyde Park to get the diamond for the engagement ring as well as everything else to follow 

Want to know what service is all about in the jewelry business check out what Hyde Park did for me I picked out an amazing diamond for the engagement ring chose the loose stone again but had no idea what kind of a ring my fiancé would want So Hyde Park said how about we just put it in a classic Tiffany solitaire setting as a temporary setting and then after you give it to her you can come back in together and pick out the perfect setting and wedding band set I was like seriously You can just do that

In the end Hyde Park will be my jeweler for life They helped me create the perfect simple birthday present and took that service all the way through doing a custom engagement ring and matching wedding band set This is the jewelry store for any guy who wants great service great prices and like me doesnt have the first clue about how to make the perfect decision Just let Hyde Park take the stress out of it like they did for me"
5,I have concerns about Heirloom Not about the food which is fantastic not quite 5 star fantastic but 45 star fantastic Nor the service which is friendly and helpful Nor about the atmosphere well somewhat about the atmosphereits quite lackluster My concern is that Heirloom claims to be fine dining for our current economic times when 50 entrees seem obscene But what theyve done is create a menu of less expensive small plates where you need to order at least 3 per person to be totally full so you end up spending as much if not more as you would at other highend establishments On my visit the place was practically dead Granted it was a weeknight but I cant see how a place can survive with only 3 of its probably 15 tables occupied Especially not in such a high rent location where restaurants have dropped out like flies The menu changes weekly which is really nice if you go to a place often but who could possibly afford to come here often If you do go they have a 25 off coupon on their website Not 25 percent25 DOLLARS I would love to return to Heirloom every month to try chef Michael DeMarias latest culinary creations but thats certainly not within my budget Im afraid others have the same problem and that this place wont be around for long Therein lie my concerns because I really did love my meal
5,"I dont drink a lot of coffee but Im a fan of tea Especially strange tea that I probably cant pronounce right Oh and I like it when it smells like scotch Yep Im a fan of Lapsang Souchong

But Im not a fan of foofy And thats one thing that Tea infusion is not Its not foofy Its funky Its fun And everyone who works there is really friendly

Beyond the teas the food is good too I dont know that Id eat there every night but its a wider variety than Id expect at a tea place

This is a regular stop of mine Makes Tempe Markeplace worth it"
5,We came here for lunch and were a little leery when we first walked in I had the cream of leek soup my mother had the sausage salad and my aunt had the Greek salad and we were all very impressed We took a bangers and mash pasty to go but we are so full that itll be awhile before we can try it The service was a little slow but the quality of food and atmosphere made up for the inconvenience
5,My husband called me from work one day after a coworker had brought in several dozen bosa donuts and he said Ive just had the best donuts Ive ever eaten Me being a pastry lover had to give it a try We went early one morning and got one of every donut they had they were awesome The place is a little hole in the wall and had I not been told to go I probably would have never gone in The donuts were soft and fresh the cinnamon crumble one was my favorite and they were also reasonably priced We live in ahwatukee so its a little out of our way but we will definitely be coming here again
1,"The theater itself I have no problem with Its the fact that we came out of the theater to a broken out driver passenger window my doors unlocked and some Dumb Ass broke into my car and didnt even take anything Really 
I shouldve known better given the area but it was the only Harkins showing the movie we wanted to see Security was nice enough to leave a note on my windowCan you believe theres No Cameras in the parking lot at all Ugh Disappointed customer to say the least Will not be back there thats for sure"
5,I took my daughter there to get her nose pierced for her birthday they were very nice and professional and made her feel comfortable  Its a nice shop and they were very friendly and did a great job  I will definitely recommend them
5,Best Thai food  Order the dry garlic chicken
1,Tried Shortys today sadly it will be my one and only visit To begin service was mediocre at best portions are smallI thought my steakburger was a slider and there was also the black facial hair that was in between the cheese and burger Thats when customer service went down the drain all we got was a thats weird and an Im sorry If your running a joint and a customer finds a big hair in their food you do whatever you can to save that customer and make them want to come back Something not just sorry for your luck I will stick with RocketBurger just up the street cheaper bigger portions tasty and most important they got great service If I had to sum it up for ya in a few words Id sayDONT DO IT
5,"San Felipes Cantina will always have a special place in my heart Ive been coming here since it opened and I havent been disappointed yet Heres some of my favorite things about them

Happy Hour  San Felipes has one of the best happy hours in the valley Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm7pm and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically 2030 You cant beat that

Service  I usually sit up at the bar when I stop by and they have some of the friendliest bartenders in town They always make me feel at home when I stop by and theyre quick to serve me during the latenight hours The managers are also really good about hanging out and chatting with the customers to make them feel special It works

Food and Drinks  My favorite drink at San Felipes is probably the Mexican Iced Tea Its a long island iced tea but they use passion fruit vodka instead of the traditional unflavored vodka As far as food goes I REALLY like the baja chicken wrap the sonoran chicken sandwich and the steak burrito with green sauce A quick tip  ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great 

Overall this place is a lot of fun and I really like the laid back vibe Ill definitely be back"
5,"The PERFECT Breakfast   If only I could have this every day 

Matts is all you want a breakfast spot to becute friendly and the most amazing food out there

I highly recommend the hog and chick  You just cant go wrong with eggs bacon home fries get the home fries not the hashbrowns and their toast served with Terra Verde Farms preserves    best ever ever ever

I could write on and onyouve seen the reviews  Just make sure to make it there you wont be sorry youll be addicted"
5,"North Valley always has interesting articles to read and cool interviews with people like Alice Cooper and Young MC Bust a Move

The magazine covers the entire north valley which is very spread out And you can find it in many different places from Kierland to Anthem Its free but you can also get a subscription online"
5,"Ive been eating here more and more often lately and I like the food  If I want Mexican food and I am in the downtown chandler area this is where I stop in

The food quality is consistent  Being a creature of habit I get the same thing every time I come here

They are also serving cupcakes  Looks like the change the flavor every once in a while too  I have had a margarita flavored one and a dark chocolate and chili one  Tasty"
1,"First of all if you go here PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes  honestly  We went here 3 times  all 3 times we were over charged  either the menus were out of date or we were past happy hour time BS oh and the other excuse we just changed our menu  blah blah blah  P

then they always have to get a manager to come to the table which takes forever  I am sure they hope we leave  PLUS THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS  this is a definitely bait and switch

1st time it happened we just dealt with it and was like whatever

2nd time it happened my daughter who just got back from deployment Navy wanted to do something special for us and took us all there  My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour  The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes gimme a break  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of arguing about it  We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like whatever

3rd time  took a friend there  again we ordered devils ale  on the menu it was listed at one price when we got the bill it was almost twice as much  We waited for our server to come back she never did she totally ignored us  I gave her a dollar tip which is NOT like me i tip very well too well  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip  

If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepes  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun  We much prefer there we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again  They say 3rd time is a charm Well it is its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they dont give a crap

oh and if i didnt have to give a star i wouldnt have"
5,"Go here if you live in AZ  It fills the void in my life being a native Oregonian missing Deschutes Brewery  

I must admit though Ive only been here once because its a difficult place to dine with a 15 month old child  Might want to get a babysitter for this one"
5,Their emu oil is great  I use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders its wonderful  I highly recommend it  We buy it at Fresh Vitamins in Mesa  No dyes fully refined I love it
1,Worst customer service of any grocery store Ive ever been in  EVER  Id rather go to any other Safeway or any other grocery store  Ill drive the extra 10 miles just to avoid this place
5,"Ive only been to Postinos twice both times for breakfast And both times I ordered the same thing french toast Im not a big french toast kind of guy but I absolutely loved them both times and I look forward to the next brunch opportunity there 

Might want to get here early though  we arrived at 930 on a Sunday and there were only a couple of tables still open By 10am there was a significant line"
5,Best Italian sub Ive had Very nice owners Just be aware theres no place to sit so youll have to get it to go
5,Decided to give this place a chance and was quite delighted I am vegan and thats an issue sometimes I tried the vegetable chow meinmedium spicy and I love it I get extra broccoli and there is so much flavor in the veggies and noodles My husband has tried the General Tsos chicken The BBQ pork chow mein the mu shu pork and the garlic chicken and he loved them all The great thing is that this is a family run business and it shows in the food I highly recommend at least trying this place its reasonably priced and there are great lunch specials during the week
5,I really like this Urgent Care  Dont let their youthful looks fool you John Altic PAC and Dr Brenden McRae are wonderful and very caring In addition to having Urgent Care they are now opening a Private Family Practice I cant wait for them to be my primary care physicians as well  Great job gentlemen and staff
5,So many great accessories and cute clothes I got my accessories for my Wedding here and they were perfect Everything from clutches to earrings from cute tops to watches they have everything color coordinated
5,Cant say enough good things about Sens Excellent food and excellent service
5,"Okay you might be asking yourself who reviews a Taco Bell or even looks up reviews for Taco Bell Well I would ask myself that if I were you but here we are

This Taco Bell is awesome They have really nice and friendly people working for them and my husband and I would eat inside because we liked the service We lived a block away and came every so often over 35 years and it was always the same We appreciate that kind of good service and its not one you would expect to get from a fastfood chain"
5,It is great  Great ambiance food and service  I love the rooftop bar too
5,"My daughters 128i BMW was horribly keyed this summer and we found Harvils through State Farm Insurance Fred Harvil was very friendly and helpful to work with and we really appreciated his service She dropped her car off on Monday I believe and she had the car back by Friday His rates were very good and ended up being lower than we had expected and what we liked about him is that he was very honest My daughter had accidentally backed her car into a pole earlier that summer and hadnt gotten it fixed because she kept getting quoted around 500 and couldnt do that but because Harvil was already going to fix the rest of the car he only charged her 100 to repair the back bumper which was really nice He also set us up with a rental car for her through Hertz that she was able to leave there at the shop and have them pick up which was great and convenient 

All in all Fred Harvil was very pleasant to work with timely and left her car looking like new Definitely recommend"
5,"Introduced to Dlish today by a friend Id already had breakfast although the menu looks great lots of delicious sounding healthy options but he suggested a Chai coffee I dont usually like Chai Tea but I thought Id give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation

When I ordered the server suggested a Sexy Dirty Chai which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink The place is tiny has a really cool funky interior and also has a drive thru a true local gem The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon "
5,"We love this place We got Miss V washed up with the highest package with an extra leavein conditioner for her super shedding coat AND she got some hand baked peanut butter doggie treats all for 22 SO worth it Plus all the employees are SO nice And now that they are starting to carry her dog food Blue Buffalo well be headed to Wag N Wash for her chow too  
LOVE"
5,It is almost impossible to find a great sandwich shop that actually has good grinders and sandwiches  Well my search is over  I stumbled across this little shop and felt right at home in New England  Being from Connecticut I was so excited to see all the great food on the menu  I had the Vermonter and it was bliss at every bite  The owners are extremely friendly and you can tell that they want you to be very happy with their food and service  Great food and great service you will not be dissapointed
5,LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE  always need to find a reason to drive so far to Chandler  so fresh soup delish and sauces yummy BYOB and casualfeels like my grandmas
1,"Not a fan  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats my total came to be about 300  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my plastic money the debt card and they wouldnt take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a 500 minimum  What store has a minimum nowadays  

The customer service was also very lack luster  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying 

Needless to say a store that I used to like I will no longer be back  There are so many other great dog stores"
1,"Wow  Not in a good way

The sashimi was good because all they did was cut it but that was iteverything else made me wish I went real Chinese Not Chinese making sushi culture theives
PS snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll"
5,With our regular Indian place converted to buffet and my lunch companions refusing to go dont tell them but I would go anyway it was time to find a new Indian spot for the work lunch rotation  We were on a mission and I was trying to figure out whether Jewel would be added to the list of acceptable lunch haunts  After managing a circuitous route to the top floor of a parking garage we navigated a maze like structure of corridors to find the restaurant  Travel time was starting to negate Jewel from the list  The lunch menu was small and we all ordered the thali meat combination    After a modest wait time the food arrived in an array of metal containers and was delicious  I hope we go back but majority rules
1,I used to love Banana Republic  I stopped by at lunch to buy a few outfits I wasted quite a bit of time in this storeto an frazzeling degree  The choppy layout of the new store is annoying  The clothing line changed drastically so you look like you just came from an overpriced and cold beach  I was looking to dress sharp and professional not wrinkled and haphazzard  I wanted short sleeves not flimsy spagetti straps long sleeved blouses and SWEATERS helloits JUNEand ARIZONA  Banana Republics new format and collection is a huge FAIL
5,"Kara is absolutely wonderful She does a GREAT waxing and I am going to have her do a facial for me very soon 
The atmosphere is very relaxing and Kara is an absolute doll of a person I would highly recommend her"
5,"Never disappointed with this place

Get the brisket get the pork Get the beans Theyre bangin The sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good the cheesy potatoes are good too The real standouts I would have to say are the brisket and the beans Do NOT skip the beans Trust me 

Im not even a meat person but I do like Joes because everything is cooked just right Order extra of everything and you will be glad you did Makes for great leftovers Dont forget to get some BBQ sauce too Personally Im not one to douse everything in BBQ sauce just a little dip here and there but the sauces are really good 

Even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food Its simple downhome good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy Ive never actually dinedin at this place Ive always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the takeout window They are pretty fast

My future fatherinlaw wants me to choose Joes to cater our wedding rehearsal dinner Did I really ever imagine in my wildest princess wedding dreams that I would choose BBQ for my rehearsal dinner Not really but Joes is excellent and were heading toward a laidback wedding theme anyway to take it easy on our many outoftown family and friends I am sure they will all love Joes and I cant wait for them to try it"
1,"I think chef Silvana Esparza first located the restaurant here on CALLE DIECISEIS she renamed the street all by herself apparently to take advantage of cheap rent  There was no way she was going to locate her Scottsdalish restaurant actually in Scottsdale  So people from the wealthier areas  and some First Friday urban hipsters whose parents foot their bills  make the trek down to CALLE DIECISEIS to partake in everything Barrio Cafe  And they think its cool that they are going there past the check cashing places the people waiting at the bus stops and the rawness of this part of central Phoenix

And what is everything Barrio Cafe

Pretentious service
LOUD dining room
NO parking
Fusion food that is about 10 years past its prime
High prices

Lets talk a little about the last item on the list

Besides using vulgar language in her YouTube videos for pseudo social activism Esparza seems to have forgotten her own humble upbringings  Its ironic that the very people who live on and around CALLE DIECISEIS cannot afford to eat in her restaurant  The Mexican immigrants and their sons and daughters who do the cooking the cleaning the landscaping and all that for Phoenix are not welcome at the Barrio Cafe  I know that this is not a taco truck but there is some overwhelming irony here that you locate your restaurant in a working class area and supposedly have sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden and the neighbors cant even eat  at your restaurant  I guess thats capitalism  Like that new car by the way"
5,"Hospitality Suite Resort was my home away from home this last week and although they are not a posh spa type resort they were filled with heart and gave me everything I needed in the seven nights I spent there

Why did I chose Hospitality Suite Resort  I needed a place for seven nights eight days while I worked on my qualifying exams and worked on my dissertation in Phoenix  I had two basic needs a place that was cheap and had free internet  That they had a daily breakfast was a plus as was laundry facilities  They had the best price for all these options so I jumped

After a flight to Sky Harbor getting a rental car driving to Scottsdale I had a hard time finding the hotel  I finally asked another hotel on Scottsdale Ave and she said OH yeah the numbers are funny that way  Ha  Very funny  After that first time I didnt have any trouble finding my way back to it again  My morning commute to the Hokokum campus was very straightforward  I was pretty much set

I was greeted by a fellow named JJ who talked very fast or maybe because of my travel and the time I was processing very slowly  He gave me a room on the third floor that was overlooking the pool PS all rooms are overlooking the pool  He told the best place to park and showed me on the map where the elevator was  It did take me awhile to find the elevator with my stuff in my hands but eventually I did  There were some BritishFrench kiddos hanging out in the poor area whooping it up and there was music coming from the lounge but it didnt matter I was so tired I could have fallen asleep in a airplane oh wait I did that too

The next morning I took in more of my surroundings  My room had a lovely little kitchen with all the necessities and a nice large bathroom with a small stall shower  The was a lovely fullsized ironing board and steam iron  There was a coffee maker in the kitchen along with a toaster microwave fridge small and hotplate  There was a nice reading lamp over the bed and an easytouse clock radio  There was a desk as well as a table and three chairs  The king size bed was comfortable but not overly so  I certainly had no trouble sleeping while there but I didnt have a trouble getting out of bed either  Perfect

Breakfast was a choice of five breakfasts  The menus were laminated meaning the that choices did not change but that was ok  I chose two eggs sausage hash browns whole wheat toast oj and coffee every morning  By the second day I was greeted by name  That was a nice touch because I felt that I was very very far away from home

Instead of eating out every night I went to Food City just down the road and bought supplies to heat up in the micro I bought sodas for the fridge and micro popcorn  Ahhhhh all the comforts of home  Because I was up late working on my classwork the partying didnt bother me  The pool was a magnet for people even at night because it finally was cooling down  I didnt go to any of the happy hours friends dont let friend write on their dissertation drunk but they sure looked like people were having fun

Doing laundry was a little complex due to my own nonreading of the map  I made this huge circuitous route because I didnt know there was a laundry room in the part of the hotel I was staying  Next time I will know

All in all I enjoyed my stay at Hospitality Suite Resort  Next time I would bring less clothes because of the superb laundry facilities you dont need to bring quarters because you buy tokens at the lobby  Next time I would remember to bring a swim suit because those pools looked sooooo good
Yep next time I would stay at Hospitality Suite Resort its got it all"
5,I LOVE the pretzels Wish they would bring back the Asiago Dip but hey garlic salt and cabs are 2 of my main food groups Great atmosphere can always see a game on one of the many TVs even when my girlfriend thinks Im paying attention to her Milk stout is my favorite beer but the light isnt bad either Something tells me the others are good too but its hard to get me to stray from my patterns Oh well Ill leave someone else to review those All in all the food and beer is great and the servers seem to know what theyre doing too
5,I was very impressed with the service and food St Francis provided a delicious meal and beautiful ambiance that was just right for a group of clients after work
1,"Ive now tried Thai Elephant three times  My first two experiences were solidly mediocre  nothing was awful but aside from one delicious dessert black sticky rice with pumpkin custard nothing stood out either  As a recent Bay Area transplant I admit to being a bit picky but in my 6 months in Phoenix Ive found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings Swadee in Chandler Thai Lahna in Arcadia Sala Thai in North Phoenix and in a pinch Thai Hut in Central Phoenix  Until now Thai Elephant hadnt really done it for me but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance

On Friday looking forward to a relaxing night at home I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken Panang Curry with beef extra spicy and Spicy Eggplant with tofu spicy which I thought would be automatic given the name but apparently wasnt  I got home meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees and sat down to enjoy my feast

Wow  I dont know quite where to begin but to say that I was disappointed doesnt begin to cover it  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store only less flavorful marginal at best but edible  The chicken didnt stand out as being of particularly low quality but the noodles were some of the worst Ive had at a Thai restaurant some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy while others were seriously soggy

Sadly the subpar Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy overcooked vegetables and limp tofu  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse  Though I ordered the dish spicy the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in  The beef was the last straw for me it very may well have been the worst quality most gristly meat Ive had at any restaurant Ive ever been to  I tried several pieces and all were similarly inedible

I really really want to like Thai Elephant but after the experience I had I dont know if I can bring myself to give it another chance  especially since Ive found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the secondworst Thai meal Ive had since moving here was at Thai Elephants sister restaurant Thai Basil in Ahwatukee"
5,"I found the food excellent but keep in mind this isnt typically Mexican food this is TexMex which is a whole different variety 

Our waitress was fantastic and talked me into getting the melted cheese on the side It was quite tasty indeed it has a bit of skin but generally if you cook cheese or milk included products into a liquid quickly it does get oneand personally I didnt havent issue about it 

The menu isnt extensive it would be nice to have a bigger menu but with how accommodating the are you could probably something off the wall and theyd be willing to do it

I ordered the bean and cheese burrito which is delicious and large 
Its a fatty and I loved it 
When asked if they cook with lard the hostess had an immediate answer and listed what they used to cook everything with I was so happy Most have no idea and arent very polite if you ask She was very friendly like everyone else we encountered there

I was told that the Steak was perfect and mrhardtoplease was filled up had left overs and stayed that way the rest of the night Which was great The salsa has an interesting flavor and I must I dig it Im not a big fan of mexican rice so I didnt partake in eating it however the fan of mexican rice at the table liked it but not as much as the fajitas 

Conclusion  Excellent Staff Great Food Its TexMexnot just Mex so bare that in mind There is a difference Atmosphere reminds me of some place that would be placed in a Tarantino film Price is average sit down if not a little high Expect 2 people  over 30 dollars"
1,"RUDE RUDE RUDE
I wanted to book a diner for my wife and I  our anniversary
 The website i was on did not post the times of operation  I left a message and today got a call back from a RUDE Owner  He argues it is right there He did not ask anything about where i was o tried to help  He called to argue  with me 
 I can not believe i get a call at work and then when i tell the reason of the issue he argues with me and hangs up childish behavior  I read the reviews on DEX and other sites and found that this is true across the board Poor food prep and pretentious environment and owners good bye Lons  chief  ill never go to your location now  And my 12000 Sedona list will  be aware of your bad manners  I am a native to Scottsdale and Lons was a place that we went to almost 6 times a year It was my mothers favorite place to eat  until the food started going down hill I believe it was these people who were at the helm at that time I heard they were asked to leave

Hanging up on people this is incredible   DO NOT GO HERE"
5,I love CKs Their happy hour specials are great service is awesome and food is tasty Try the adovada pizzaits goooood
5,Ohhh this is the best place ever Every thing I have ordered has been delish
5,"My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short
Greeted immediately 
Lots of variety
Meat lovers pizza is amazing
Ask for Tawnya shes really nice and a wonderful server 
Will be back loved the excellent service"
5,"This has become one of my favorites  Theyre friendly  reasonably priced and the food is always delicious  My husband and I have tried a number of their items but my personal favorites are the BBQ pork appetizer house fried rice the mushu and lemon chicken  My husband also loves the house fried rice the mushu and the orange chicken  One of the things that is so wonderful about this place is the food isnt heavy  The sauces are light and fresh tasting  Plus Im lucky enough to be in their delivery zone  When I get delivery the food is still hot and tastes like it was made just a few minutes earlier

I have yet to be disappointed by anything Ive ordered here and to me thats a sign of a good restaurant"
1,"You want good food Youd be better off smuggling goat cheese in your boot and risking an anal cavity search for doing so than eating at this airport

You want scenery Try desert


You want a comfortable seat to wait for your delayed flight  Well you are in the desert so youd probably better off finding a cactus and straddling it face first

You want a relatively close connection for your flight Well tough shit  Oh yeah theyve got people movers but somehow they have this magical ability to disengage peoples legs  Yeah I know it sounds crazy but as soon as people step on to these things their legs stop moving and they plant their fat ass right in the middle of the walk way  Whats wrong with your legs you mammoth"
5,"Yummmmm  so authentic 

This is one of the few mom  pops type of restaurant in N Scottsdale that taste oh so authentic and fantastic 
This is by far my favorite italian restaurant in town way better than the big chain like Brios dont get me wrong they are not bad either

It is not a fancy place but very cozy And it does make you feel like you walk into one of the ristorante in Italia  the owners are 100 italiano and they only use the freshest ingredients   I had the best lasagna there you can taste the texture of the noodle the creamyness of the chess the meat favor and the freshness of the tomatoes totally awesome 
Had tried the seafood linguine there too  oh so good as well and with plenty of seafood  definitely 2 thumbs up 

During winter make sure you make reservation ahead though  this place seems to be snowbirds favorite too"
5,What a beautiful hotel The Clarendon is truly one of a kind The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you needand extras  The pool area is gorgeous and the atmosphere is delightful I had the opportunity to meet the owner Ben Bethel What an astonishing young man he is I dont know which is more impressive his efforts to make the hotel as green as possible or the fact that he helps guests with their bags as they walk through the door I cant wait for another excuse to stay at the Clarendon again
5,"My friends kidnapped me for my birthday yes because they are wonderful threw me in the back of my friend Jills van and rushed me off blindfolded of course to Radio Milano

My friend Lindsay knew I had been dying to go there I love Postinosame owner and across the streetso I just knew Radio Milano was going to be amazing

Ive never met the man that owns these restaurants La Grande Orange Postino Radio Milano etc Lindsay apparently once did lucky girl but whoever he is he is a business genius 

The atmosphere of Radio Milano was sophisticated and classy without being uptight  Everyone was extraordinarily nice and helpful  True to form for this restaurateurs style there is a large vase of fresh every day flowers that compliment the warm glow of the restaurant in general

Our server welcomed us with what were presented as Italian Potato Chips and a delicious dipping sauce  

The homemade ginger ale is so strong in taste really good

I ordered the special for the night which was a vegetable lasagna  It was soooooo good  

Im glad I have such awesome friends to kidnap me and take me to great places"
5,"We had a fantastic experience here We went on a Thursday evening and with the misters on it was still very pleasant sitting outside even in June The wine list was extremely affordable  most between 25 and 60 For Scottsdale this is a steal We shared an appetizer and a main entree The appetizer was delish Grilled bread perfectly grilled not so hard that it hurts your gums with three spreads  an amazing goat cheese and marscapone eggplant and hummus Also they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter For our entree we shared the fish special which was a sea bass with artichokes fingerling potatoes and spinach Fantastic The service was also great 

Ive come to expect any service in Scottsdale to be rude but  this place wasnt Maybe we were lucky but I enjoyed our experience"
1,"After a day full of meetings I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican I had visions of chipssalsa and margaritas We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed Egads Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street And thus begins the saga Hi are you here for happy hour We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway At least we got a booth Lucky us huh Joe lots of product in his hair brought us menus and took our drink orders He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait with the stipulation on the rocks with salt My drink and hubsters water arrived and we ordered The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time Really Joe product Chips with the meal FYI chips and salsa here arent complimentary you have to order and pay for them It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table Now the hubsters getting annoyed Its hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table Our booth was by a window but we didnt see any influx from the window of ants so were not sure where they are coming from but they dont stop Hubster mentions it a second time and then again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table By this time we are almost done eating and I just say lets finish and get the hell out of dodge Our bill comes we pay and hubster asks for the manager Hell hes even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up thus well call him Bed Head Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house Really Thats your solution He said hed make sure other patrons arent seated in this area Egads no thanks we just wanted to leave We werent after free food but the offer of 10 off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated A free drink Heymaybe one of those 6000 margaritas would have made everything alright As far as the food goesI had the chicken antchiladas get it lol with beans and rice and they were dry I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them Hubster had a steak and avocado salad He said it was ok 
This is a never return place for us 
And a note to Joe Productchips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks and before the mealReflecting back we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant
The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good"
5,"I lived in AZ for a year whilst at JP Morgan One of the few great experiences i had out there back in LA now was going to their Good yes capital G food places they were really really really Goodcertainly on par with eateries Ive experienced in London NYC Paris et cetera
I finally found a neighborhood that had gulp personality the Roosevelt district I was so happy and comfy in my hundredyearold guest house with hard wood floors huge preair conditioning windows a sizable green backyard and an unobstructed view of the teenytiny Phoenix skyline And just down the street from my extraordinary little residence was the absolutely amazing wonderful and perfect Tammie Coe the person AND the bakery who had just opened their venerable doors
I was there every morning for their exquisite breads cheeses sweet things perfect eurostandard coffee lovely attendantsI miss it so much
It reminded me of Patisserie Valerie in London or any good bakery in Pariswith a cool fun and welcome American twist

I shall always go back to Tammie when ever I find myself in dreary Walmartized Phoenix Tammie you are an artist My only hope is that you will consider opening a location in Los Angeles Eat your heart out Nancy Silverton"
5,"I am a GSpot addict  Had to limit myself from going every week though  

Took the hubby there after a date night the other weekend  It was his first time to try gelato  Hes a ColdStone guy 100 and he really enjoyed the Tiramisu gelato  

The focaccia flatbread is awesome  And I would post a photo of the Focaccia Flatbread I got earlier to eat along with my homemade salad but in the words of LOLCat I eated it and forgot to take a photo first   

My favorite salad dressing is the champagne vinegarette  
The mintchip gelato is freaking awesome  
The stracciatella gelato mixed with mint  even better  

GSpot is so awesome that I just walked back over and got my Mint  Stracciatella combo  Baby C wanted something sweet   D"
5,I take the lightrail downtown sometimes just to go here I walked in the first time to a bustling energetic singing cheering crowd and thought where the H am I I felt like I had left Phoenix and ended up in a far away magical land of wonder and excitement Food is decent for a bar great beer great local music its the first time I saw The Waters Downtown Phoenix needs more places like this
5,"Great food  Good service
Salsa is the best  Enchiladas are very good  I dont know what they put in the sauce but damn is it good  No better Mexican food anywhere in Scottsdale"
5,I went to Tommy Vs for dinner last night with my husband and several of his clientsWOW  This is my new favorite restaurant in town  They have a private dining area that they can close off with curtains and turn the music off which is perfect for a business dinner  I am vegan one of his clients is doing the paleo diet and another is gluten free and they had DELICIOUS options for all of us while also serving AMAZING pasta and fish dishes to others at the table  I cant recommend this restaurant enough  I am just sorry I havent discovered it earlier  YUM YUM YUM  PS  Very cool atmosphere too
5,"Update

Went back last night for dinner this place is still awesome I had the Las Vegas Rolls they were pure deep fried goodness"
5,"Really good pizza has to be among the most perfect foods in all the world  Really good pizza would likely be on my last meal request list  Specifically the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza at La Grande Orange Pizzeria which has to be near the top of the list for all the great pizzas the two us who contributed to this review have consumed  And that is a lot of pizza

We were visiting Scottsdale as tourists when the concierge at the resort recommended this place to us  Bless her  Very convenient too to be able to shop for wine at La Grande Orange grocery adjoining and other goodies while we waited on our take out pizza order  httpwwwyelpcombizlagrandeorangegroceryphoenixhrid4cXbhzxxtmExF9kRjmFViQsrcself

The only hitch here is parking is terrible during peak hours So it goes  The pizza is worth the parking hassle  Were on our way back to Scottsdale in a few days for another visit and La Grande Orange Pizzeria is on our go list again The Rocket Man pizza is calling our name this time"
5,"A very professional company that takes the time to deal with you on a personal level  
With great reassurance from Nate and his team they were able to handle the short sale of our home with very little stress and in a timely manner
They really helped when we thought no one could  From beginning to end we were always kept informed and they got the job done"
5,Holy frijoles this place lived up to the hype Im surprised how how good the pizza is here in Arizona Very tasty and definitely some of the best pizza Ive had in the valley The only downside is that there is usually a long wait to be seated and then once your seated it takes a longer wait for your pizza The prices are average the service was soso but the food was excellent Nice location too right in Old Town so you can have a drink at a nearby bar while you wait for your table Cool place for datenight or to have dinner with family Its fairly casual but charming at the same time
5,"Sigh

I love places like this  It is adorable and unique and intimate and perfect  The outdoor patio looks like a great hang out spot but obviously it is too hot for any of that just yet and the interior is small and intimate  I was surprised when I walked in as it was much smaller than I thought it would be but who knows where I got the idea that it would be a gigantic place  

Our server was hilarious and fun he happened to be from Ohio and informed me he was a Buckeye Im from Michigan but Im not a Wolverine so Buckeyes usually dont hate me and was pretty cool about taking my fun jabs at his home state  He was super attentive and even was nice enough to give me directions home horrific sense of direction I kind of wanted to be best friends with him  Anyway 

I had the one organic glass of red wine on the menu he brought me a sample first and the Pasena  Both were great beverage choices  I also got to nibble on the tomatomozzarella and flaked tuna bruschetta and was pleased with both  Id go with the original

I dream of the day that I find such a cute little place on the West side feel free to suggest one if Im missing it  The atmosphere rocks and the unique booze options only add to the charm of this place"
1,Weve eaten here a few times and the food was always good  However the last time we ate there I found a BUG in my food  When we complained to management they still thought we should pay for 50 of the meal  Never eating there again
5,"I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5star review not because Im opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy But Bandera is just that good from the upscale casual relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food

Ordering the cornbread to start is a must  itd be a crime not to The grilled artichoke and quesoguacamole apps are also wonderful I had the macho salad which was quite large and packed with good stuff I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good Dessert offerings are limited to two choices and neither blew me away but the Oreo one was the better of the two

Bandera is like its sister restaurant Houstons always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food"
5,"Tanzy Yelp and Lindsey deserve the biggest standing O for this event  

I honestly think I am still full from the generous food options that kept flowing  I kept thinking we were done but OH NO here comes another course  I felt like I was at a chef tasting menu dinner  

Right when we got there we had a glass of Champagne and were seated with a olive and meat plate followed by some bruschetta and local made cheese  After the event officially started we were hit with amazing course after amazing course  With never empty glasses of wine  

My Favs

Sweet Corn Risotto

Scallops cooked to perfection with a parsnip puree mmmmmmmm

Alaskan King Salmon

Center Cut Filet Mignon

Brussel Sprouts yes Brussel Sprouts Tempura battered with a sweet relish AMAZING

4 hour braised beef short rib Talk about melt in your mouth  

Red Velvet Bread Pudding I will go back just for this anytime I am near the Quarter

I cant wait to go back to Tanzy for a full meal but I dont know how I will be able to top this evening of amazing food  

I was very surprised to hear they have been open for 2 years as I was really blown away with their food and service  

Thanks again to everyone who helped put together this amazing event what a great way to end 2012"
5,"I actually visited here about 5 months ago but I liked it so much I figured I should give it a few good words 

I was at the mall looking for something healthier than a pizza or burger and decided upon this place It is part of their little slogan after all

I was not disappointed I chose the beef kabob with a side of fries and pita bread with a cup of hummus Everything was positively fresh and absolutely delicious And the portions were big too I didnt think I would be filled up after the meal but I was stuffed

The staff was very friendly and cooked everything in a timely manner I was surprised they werent getting nearly as much business as the other joints around the food court They dont know what theyre missing"
5,"i think this food is phenomenal this was the first place i tried asian food in AZ when moving out here years ago it has grown since then and the food is always top notch 

for a late sunday afternoon lunch the place was nearly empty but their takeout counter was constantly busy our server was friendly and attentive and kept our water glass filled 

its been a while since i ate for the review for which i write so i dont remember exactly what it was but it had the big wide rice noodles which i love i do remember that the dish was excellent and big enough to supply leftovers for lunch the next day 
they ask how spicy and ive eaten thai food spicy and it is downright dangerous so we opted for medium with a side of spice juicewhich was HOT

we will continue to patronize Totties as they are consistent and the food and service has always been very very very good and very reasonable prices"
5,This place is beautiful great patio with classic decor  Went to Happy hourof course and had a few glasses of wine and  yummy calamari  Service was off the charts  We were sitting on the patioa little hot and Schwettyand the server kept moving the umbrellas to shade up as the sun setWOW
5,"I am not usually a fan of botanical gardens They seem too precious too perfect to be of much interest And lets face it flowers and plants are beautiful things but when you pay to look at them in neat rows something is lost

That said Desert Botanical Gardens is an exception to this garden cynic Many of these cacti look like they are from another planet like something you would see in a scifi film and say wow its too bad those crazy plants dont exist They sprawl out on the ground weaving and turning every which way or compose huge bizarre formations high off the ground I never knew such bizarre life forms existed or that some cacti look like trees

The gardens are full of windy paths where one is also likely to find a family of quail lizards or a jackrabbit or two Various species of bird can be seen here as well especially at dusk I especially love watching the birds fly in and out of nests theyve made in the upper arms of cacti

This place never grows old Its a great introduction to the desert for people from out of town and because the cacti have been collected from around the world a cool botany lesson for us all here"
5,Great place  Hard to see behind Carls Jr on Southern Ave but is Worth finding
1,So sad to say I have to change my rating from 5 stars to 1  I had been a faithful customer of Katies for years at least 3 or 4  She told me she wasnt going to be doing nails anymore because she had developed carpal tunnel  I was heartbroken  But she told me she was training the others in her shop to be able to do nails like her so I figured I would continue to go there  Next appt I needed I called and scheduled and said it doesnt matter with who because Katie isnt doing nails anymore right  I was then told that Katie is still doing nails but she was full that day  Very hurtful  I always tipped her VERY well and was always willing to work with her schedule  But needless to say I dont go there anymore havent been there since I ended up cancelling that appt and going elsewhere
5,"I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night I went there and had an awesome time Service was prompt and if something was off our server Jeff who was amazing explained why something happened but didnt blame anyone and didnt use server jargon I do understand the jargon but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it 

Warm chips and salsas  warm bean dip came out  awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name It burned but I loved it I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba and ordered it extra spicy Of course I would I was with my girl and she likes strawberry margaritas so we split the house margarita for 2 frozen with sugar of course Im not a huge margarita person but it was really good She ordered the cheese enchiladas She takes safe choices when we go eat more on the margaritas in a min 

Food come out and seriously it was some of the best spanishmexican Ive had in a while Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food It was fresh Which is hard to find these days and Im pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros Which is cool Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70s Im not kidding when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want Black pinto or the 3rd kind that is a combo of blackpinto with some onion tomatoes and of course whats that Hatch chiles I highly recommend them I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles It sets them apart It brought the heat

After dinner I ordered another margarita

This time I asked Jeff of a recommendation Why do I do this Because the people that work at any restaurant know the fooddrinks there more than you will ever know Nuff said He brought out some margarita I dont even know the name It kicked my ass thank god my girl was driving home thats all Im going to say Thanks

Thats why this place gets 5 stars It deserves it in my opinion
I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process I dont want food thats bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food That makes for a BLAND place thats filled with well bland people This place uses heat salt pepper and other spices that I dont know of What a freaking great idea Too hot for you Then dont eat food that is 99 based on heat

I will surely be going back and I wont have a bad time"
1,The cool name of the place is the only good thing here The burgers are belowaverage and unenjoyably is that a word messy Fries too greasy Seating not comfortable Skip it
5,Good food if all the Taiwanese comes here that means this is really good
5,"This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town  This is not your roach infested 24 hour drive through kind of burrito joint either  Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca 1 and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix
1Full bakery with mouth watering fresh pastries
2Fresh ingredients and great prices
3Also serves beer if you feel like having a Corona with your meal as opposed to take out
4Little market has the best prices in town on citrus fruits and just enough of everything to cook up a little Mexican meal Ranch Market not needed
5Make your own pico salsa bar make it your style and get as much of it as you want
So if you are downtown looking for authentic Mexican this is the place  Of course it is super casual take out or seat yourself kind of place so dont  try to flatter your date here But get there early Im pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10"
5,I went to sears today to check on a layaway that I placed online but was going to pickup here Margaret the associate couldnt find me in her system so she personally called the searscom help line to find out what was happening She was friendly professional and extremely helpful in solving my problem I went home a happy customer and am very thankful to Margaret for her help
1,This place has really bad service and the food is barely decent I would advise not to dine here There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix
5,"Shoes and purses and makeup  o my

Your sales totally RAWK guys  I mean seriously  5070 off gotta catch it just right people and then an extra 30 off that  I feel like a wild thing you make my heart sing

OK now today the most I found was 40 off  B U T  then theres MAC  Oooooooo ya baby  All that glitters is NOT gold  ok its the small things

It was still fun to look at all the purses And mark some for future reference  Hey I am a patient person I stop for red  tags that is"
5,Great food great prices and great service  I am a big eater and could not even finish all my food for only 8 dollars   The orange chicken was fresh and tender with excellent flavor  The combo also came with fried wantons and spring rolls  Super far from my house but worth the drive
5,"Yes before you ask I still love Desert Stages Theatre perhaps more than ever  This is Andrews fifth play there and this time he plays the Knave in Alice in Wonderland
Normally we dont ask for a specific role but the director of Annie Jr thought he would be cute as the Dormouse as he popped up from the table so thats what we asked for this time during audition
And we anxiously waited for the casting to be posted  When the casting was posted he did not get the requested part and as a mom and a parent I was glad
Why you may ask  Because to me as a mom and a parent its very important to teach my son the importance of handling success with graciousness and moving through disappointments with a positive attitude  When he asked why he didnt get the part I told him in simple words that the director had a vision of what the whole play should be like and she saw Andrew in the role of Knave and that was his special role  I also told him that it doesnt matter what role you get if you play it with all you got and go out there and perform with your heart as there are no small parts you will capture the audiences attention and that will be your moment
He listened with a typical 5 year old attitude and became very excited about being the Knave  And I was also excited for him because this time around he had 2 long lines to memorize and speak
With each review Ive written about how Andrew has grown through DST and here Ive included a video where you can see him growing aware of theatre and performance  httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvfsG07sMlZ5sfeaturerelated  This time around he started asking me if he was a main character starting to understand the structure of a performance  It was great to see his awareness growing  I highly recommend bringing your own child to audition for a play here  
It will be an amazing experience
Really DST is about the kids  Trusting the kids to do their part and giving them responsibilities  Once the curtain lifts the kids are responsible for THEIR performance and for each other  Its fantastic to see the kids have their moments on stage being responsible for moving and arranging the set take care of the tech go from loose energy backstage to fanstatic actors on stage  Its all fabulous
If you have doubts of what kids can do go to a show at Desert Stages Theatre and be amazed  Truly if you believe in your kids as DST shows again and again your kids will shine and raise above your expectations"
5,"For a boba drink fan like me it is still rare to find a tea place that has authentic tea and not just milk powder hot or cold tea choices and boba and tea that taste great individually or separately

I ordered an iced chocolate chai yum such a difference from plain old Oregon Chai used at most coffee houses with boba  The only negative is that the drink was 491 but it was well worth it  Mmmmmmm love this place"
5,"My friend took me for a birthday lunch  John our waiter was very helpful and had perfect timing  We shared the Stetson Chopped Salad and Fillet on Toast with leeks and homemade potato chips with blue cheese  The kitchen platesplit our fillet always a plus  The salad with salmon chicken is offered was tossed tableside  CC always has its own twist on offerings   The bread pudding and banana icecream were decadent  
 Wish I lived closer"
5,"well dang gummitgit on over here and by me some camo flawjtha kind that has little dangly moss on itand while yur at it i need me a gun

too bad i already have a gun and camo i use to be a big hunterdeer dove turkey squirrel ducks etc its what you do in south georgia when your fridge is empty and youre hungry 

this bass pro shops is ENORMOUS i love it although i dont hunt anymore my brother and father do so every year i get gift cards for them from Bass Pro Shops the gear and guns are more expensive than other places but their selection is incredible when my dad comes out here i cant wait to take him here to see all the taxidermy and fish tanksi know hell love it 

the staff is usually friendly the firearms dept is a bit intimidating and the guys at the counter can be smart asses but this place is just really neat overall it is also a family retreat so dont be surprised to see hundreds of kids running wild while their parents let them be terrors"
5,"Ive been taking mine and my familys cars to Cathedral for more than a decade We are always treated fairly and always have a good experience  the guys always stand by their work and go the extra mile to be sure our cars are fixed properly They work on both our newer cars and my cars from the 50s and 60s 

Whenever anyone is looking for a mechanic I will send them here without fail  and John and the guys at Cathedral have always come through by totally taking care of anyone I send to them In a business filled with some sketchy practices I know that whether I send my wife a friend or a coworker to Cathedral they will be treated honestly and fairly Cars break and break down thats a fact of owning one Im glad I have Cathedral to make dealing with it so easy and stress free so I can get back on the road as quickly and cheaply as possible"
5,Great happy hour specials  All the appetizers are delicious  Service is first rate and its nice to sit outside on the patio  Great people watching without being too obnoxious  LOL
5,This review pertains to carnitas and as such should not be taken as a suggestion for ordering any of the following fish tacos rice beans horchata Thats about it Yum
5,I love that this Safeway is right across the street from my work I like to walk here for a bit of exercise to get lunch The deli is awesome They have a sandwich bar that has these really great gourmet ingredients they will make a sandwich for you For 549 its not too bad and if you use your Safeway card you buy 7 get the 8th sandwich free They also have premade salads and a hot bar as well Very friendly Alan who has made my sandwiches the last couple weeks is very friendly and does a good job Bonus points the Starbucks is right next to it
5,"Imagine a white silk wedding dress black Well that may be a bit dramatic but it was pretty bad More than 15 years after my wedding I took my dress in to Bell They kept my dress for a couple weeks called me when it was ready and I was so excited to see it almost new They did a fantastic job and were careful not to over treat the lace and silk with chemicals They made me feel like they really cared 

The business is family owned and the man at the front is so nice to work with And the pricing was extremely fair I paid 89 which was much more reasonable than other places I checked 

I highly recommend Bell Cleaners"
5,This is one super cool cafelounge  They serve coffee cocktails and some quick bites that can go along great with your drinks  There are several rooms you can choose from to sit and relax  Art decor surrounds this stylish joint and just had a great time here sipping on coffee and chatting with a friend who recommended this coffee shop to me  I noticed a younger adult crowd here but it doesnt matter  WiFi friendly too
1,Lots of gay on gay homophobia here  Hick bars in Alabama are more gay friendly  Staff and owners know this but they do not seem to care  Oh well
5,I hired Property AZ to rent my upsidedown home in North Peoria stuck with the house so we rent it out they are very experienced and had great customer service  I have had bad experiences in the past with management companies not taking care of the renters or getting back to me
5,"This review is mainly for the bar and a few light ok not light but small snacks  

Met with a couple people during their soft opening and there was absolutely nothing soft about it  I got there a few minutes early and posted up at the bar to grab a Manhattan  This drink is usually my boozometer when I am trying a place first  Ok weve got something here this drink is tasty  Started talking to the bartenders and got a really comfortable feeling from them  When was the last time that you sit down to the bar and  they ask your name tell you theirs and then shake your hand  

After the manhattan the rest of the group showed  The bar was a little too busy to fit the three of us so I took my second drink sazerac to the table  Sazerac was tasty as well  Rest of the table ordered some drinks and nothing negative to be said anywhere  We each had around 4 or 5 drinks and every last one of them was delicious  

We were comped a few bar snack and all were delicious but the stand out was the warm nuts twss  Mixed nuts warmed with Herbs De Provence and a little bit of chili flake I believe  Soooooo good  

As for the style of the place it is fantastic  Feels cool but not cliche  The Palomar staff did a fantastic job of designing this space  As of now this is the one place in City Scape that is worth while"
5,"Pita Jungle is now one of my favorite places to go for dinner Its both affordable and healthy Thought its usually  crowded with Hipster ASU students I have yet to receive bad service Our food has usually come out in a timely matter

As for the environment Its very nicely decorated with art from local artists and its very well lit  Its nice and open so you can see whats going on through out the restaurant Its never to noisy so it would be a great place to take a family or even a date

Almost every visit Ive always gotten either the Broiled Chicken Salad or the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap The chicken has always been moist and dish is always flavorful The lemon vinaigrette dressing is almost good enough to drink  Though I have not tried a lot on the menu some of the food they bring out always make me say Ooh whats that"
5,"Not that you can compare Firebird to anywhere else in Az but I have been to Joliet Raceway in Chicago and even though thats newer I like the arrangement of Firebird and the availability of the different tracks available to race on

First off  NHRA come on hands down one of THE coolest events in Az ever next to NASCAR and well pro any sports but the 8000hp cars come only once a year  The pits are setup nice so every ticket gets into the pits to check out the teams and cars beer and food are expensive but what else is new

They also have drag racing events any type of racing event drift road moto races dirt bikes monster trucks top fuel drag boats on the lake Im sure Im missing a lot but nowhere else has this in Az

Parking is always good to go driving out of there just takes a while as youve got one main road that you get on to funnel onto the I10 but not much they can do about that

Great place keep bringing in the NHRA and letting us use the road tracks for our motorcycles and Ill be happy"
5,"Teresa S and I were one of the lucky ones to win tickets to see Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci last night at the Symphony Hall and we were impressed with the acoustics The overall sound quality of the live act was fantastic so overall Id say that the gig was pretty amazing

Its a fabulous hub of culture but the food concessions need some urgent attention The only munchies they have are desserts like cookies or pies so be sure to have dinner first

One of the great things they offer is you can now prereserve your intermission drinks

You can preorder your favorite libation before the show and they will have them ready on the refreshment table 
That would save you time in case you need to whiz to the loo and not have to wait in line again to buy your drinks

Thank you again to Yelp and Arizona Opera The show was wonderful"
5,So I just called to book a class for me and a friend from a Groupon we bought The classes for the next 2 weeks were all booked  I called and spoke to a very pleasant Paul who said they are extending this offer for a month Yippee You rock and we cant wait to try our hand at this exciting craft Huge props for Great customer service
5,This restaurant has the best Italian food I have ever ate in my life Definitely one of the best restaurants in AZ I had the sautéed calamari for an appetizer and an amazing dish for dinner with red snapper and pasta Their bread also melts in your mouth Blown away by the service Gilda was my server and she was amazing Everyone was super nice professional courteous and sooooooo hospitable Ive never had service this good at a restaurant other than at Cafe Poca Cosa in Tucson SERIOUSLY AMAAAAAZING restaurant
5,"A must  One of the BEST dog food stores in the Valley  Great service and quality natural feed products for your dog   You can rest at peace knowing that your pets are in GREAT hands

5,"Easy 5 star fun at the Phoenix Zoo Ive never seen critters so closeup before At the Monkey Village they dont even have cages The giraffes came right up to us I spent half my beer money on fishheads and shrimp feeding the stingrays It was a blast

We had great time
yow bill

PS  Ive never commented on other peoples reviews before But jeez When someone goes to the zoo and complains about the cost of a hot dog or a snow cone well for spider monkeys sake get a clue"
5,"Great place Ive been coming here for quite some time now and every time I received excellent customer service The servers are always friendly and attentive

I LOVE the sushi there They have a lot of fun new rolls that are unique to Bamboo Grille The spicy sauce they put on the rolls gives them a great kick too

Recently Ive noticed that the place has looked a little unfinished with random stuff here and there Baffled I asked a server and was informed that they are in the process of remodeling Needless to say Im excited for the newly designed Bamboo Grille"
5,"They say you never forget your first  Well Postino Central was my first Postino and I remember my first sip and bite like it was yesterday

The atmosphere here is very sexy at night  Candlelight and sexy music add to the already chic ambience Postino has  

The food  Bliss  I can still remember how the creamy ricotta and sweet figs on my bruschetta tantalized my tongue that first night  I can feel the velvety red wine at the back of my mouth and drizzling down my throat  

Parking is a bit of a hassle but they have valet for a reason

If youre stuck waiting for a table squeeze in at the bar and grab a glass of wine or three  People watching is almost as fun here as eating  

Now that there is a Postino in the East Valley I am hoping Postino Central will get a little less busy if only to serve my selfish purposes  I love everything about this place and I hope to be back soon"
1,"IHOP is barely a step up from Dennys in terms of boring chain food Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there and it tasted like squishy mushy cardboard The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers

The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good I dont mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily The coffee is almost bad but the waitresses always look happy

update April 2 2011

Whyd I go back I hate this place now We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast I was excited to do this and was eager I shouldve stayed home

My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold tasted like cardboard and was crunchy The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt crispy and did not look like bacon at all

My sausage I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth was totally cold I sent it back and complained I think she microwaved my plate 

Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee She said they had Mocha Vanilla or Hazelnut I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one she said yes and brought me disgusting hazelnut glad Im not allergic

Ok now its three hours later My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts Ive been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didnt lay down she would puke Seriously

The management district managers really need to care enough to read YELP  They remodeled the outside of this place and I guess spent all their money to make it look pretty so wed forget they serve dogfood"
5,"This is what I love about Phoenix you find these little treasures where you expect them the least

Loved everything about the place We had a team dinner in one of the rooms and it really felt like we were having dinner in someones dining room Super cute atmosphere loved the pictures from all over Europe I has the vegetarian rellenos sp and my mouth is still watering just thinking about it 

We also had the only malbec they have by the bottle and it was delicious"
5,"Does anyone know why their regular subs are 1 more than all the other Jimmy Johns Or is that just when its delivered instead of charging a standard delivery fee Ive noticed that with the other types of sandwiches too and extrasthe slim is 4 instead of 325 and extra avo is 175 instead of 075

Thats not going to stop me from ordering though  Still love their sandwichesthey make the best veggie sub Ive had They load it up with veggies whereas I have to ask for extra everything at a certain other sub chain and then they still barely put any on Id much rather pay a little bit extra for Jimmy Johns "
5,"everytime my sister comes to town we go striaght from the airport to Karshs
our intent is to buy bagels and we do but we can never stop there and wind up with a variety of goodies all that we have comsumed over the years has been really great as for service always with a smile and friendly attitude
we used to go here all the time when we lived on n central but since we moved to the other side of the world it has become a special occasion place so please open one near us too"
5,"I took a cooking class with Chef Eddie Matney Eddies House Restaurant and his recipe called for Vanilla bean olive oil from the Olive Mill First off what he made with this recipe was phenomenal much thanks to that smooth vanilla olive oil in there I decided to google this place only to find out that Chef Beau Macmillan acclaimed a the kalamata sandwich from there as his bad boy favorite I dont know what a bad boy favorite even means but it has to be good especially since Ive had his food and was quite impressed 

I decided to make the 45 minute drive from Scottsdale out there on a Sunday afternoon to get my olive oil and try this kalamata sandwich Such a cool atmosphere inside Its like a trader joesgift shopparadise bakery all with a rural kinda on the farm feel You could easily kill an hour here just looking around at all the stuff for sale  

I couldnt believe the kalamata sandwich If you go there and order anything elseyoure wrong Freshest ingregients Ive ever tasted I feel like the pork could have just been butchered 5 minutes prior to me ordering it and the vegetables just picked from their garden which they do have there 

Pretty cool how you can sample the endless flavors of olive oil there Got myself the vanilla bean and the blood orange as well Make for some unstoppable pancakes 

Tried the gellato and wasnt all that impressed But in all due fairness Im not exactly sure what real gellato is supposed to taste like since all Ive had is gelleto spot and grateful spoon

Definitely worth the drive Great place to bring the family"
5,This dairy sells fresh milk straight from the cow  Thats what theyre licensed to sell  They use organic feed dried grasses hydrogen peroxide for cleaning certain things and iodine to clean the cows teats just like many dairies used to  They want the cows to be out on pasture but they need a bigger piece of land to do so  If you know of a piece of land in the area please suggest it to Jackie Calamos  I love their milk  As of this date milk is 10gallon the true cost of the milk or maybe even a little low  Most of the milk you buy in the store isnt worth the price  Forcing more production out of cows with hormones comes at the cost of quality and your health  SYDs has all the good stuff the proof is in the taste  Its never made us sick and weve been drinking it for 2 years  Its a miracle that this metro area actually has a dairy willing to sell fresh milk to the public  Thank you Save Your Dairy
5,Ive been to several local dermatologist and havent seen results or been fond of any the staff is extremly friendly and very helpful I highly reccomend this dr he is knowledgeable  helped me attain the results I was looking for
5,Great movie theaterstaff so friendly    If you love movies and comfy clean theaters at reasonable price check it out    Parking so easy and close as well
5,Other restaurants have come and gone but this one has been there like what my wife said about 20 years existing in the area Congratulations I loved the old recipe sourdough pizza I enjoyed it very much Neighbors please help our local business survive We need them to support our local community
1,I can summarize this in one word  YUCK  We went for dinnersupper which is part of the problem  We ordered tbone steak and chicken  The salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin  We ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as well done anyway  Everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not  At least the staff was friendly enough and food if you call it that was served quickly  My personal recommendation is that if youre not going to eat breakfast go somewhere else
5,This is how Caribbean food should be done  Excellent jerk chicken perfectly cooked plantains very good patties  I highly recommend this place if you are at all a fan of Caribbean food
5,"Beautiful wonderful and very romantic ambient setting sets the tone for a romantic dinner with the one you love 

We first experienced El Chorro back in early April and were so enchanted with our patio dining experience beautiful view of Camelback MTN lovely flora and landscaping and their adorable organic garden area That we have returned a few times and every visit has been wonderful impeccable service and delicious fare

Dinner Highlights 

Niman Ranch Steak twice baked potato asparagus
Free Range Chicken mashed and peas
Chopped salad and the Chicken Cobb salad both fresh and delicious
Veggie pasta with shrimp 

Drink High lights 

Honey pot  jack daniels lemonade drink
Mojito  strawberry and Jalapeno sooo good

The sticky buns are just sick  we always take an order home 

Fabulous  every time"
1,"I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation I am now on a glutenfree diet and have other allergies so suffice it to say I dont get to eat Italian often However I was told that they have glutenfree pasta and other choices I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe Kudos on that This is more than most places provide

However they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being glutenfree nor soy free Finding that odd I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto which seems correct I did not ask about the soy but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese

So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of glutenfree penne with pesto sauce shrimp peppers spinach and mushrooms

When my bowl of pasta arrived it had all of the above However it also had onions zucchini and eggplant yet I had to dig to find a shrimp I originally assumed I had somebody elses order

The waiter who was wonderful and attentive took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered I would have eaten the original bowl and told him so but I was more concerned as I said that it was someone elses

As a side note if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cooks flair I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item that might be acceptable But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl I only want the items I checked off

A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered Except the pasta was undercooked I dont mean really firm aldente I mean some were still way under done Now I know that glutenfree pasta takes longer to cook and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me But that bowl was almost inedible

The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl I declined and soldiered through it We were having dinner out for my wifes birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems Though I did agree to this and Im not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twicefailed 14 dinner  I do not intend to go back"
5,"Dr Farnsworth is the Jam

I had my first ever eye exam and she was kind enough to take good care of me 

She did a complete and thorough eye exam and explained each test and the importance of them

After the exam we determined that I indeed needed glasses At that point my prescription was handed over to the very sweet optician who took care of me and let me try on about a dozen different frames before I found the winning pair

Ive sadly lost them in Vegas but I will soon be back to buy my next pair so that I am not blind as a bat

LOVE YOU GUYS"
1,Wow this place was steps below horrible I should have known better considering the place was empty on ASU game night The food was greasy and flavorless Everything on the plate was flat Ya I said it Flat Bland disappointing food Save your money and eat at taco bell You will thank me later
1,"Second to worst dining experience of all time

Our waitress was a little timid which is fine but it we shouldnt have to wait 20 minutes just to order our food  Our food took 45 minutes to arrive and while our friends steak came out hot our Hibachi Steak and Potatoes were room temperature  Sent it back to be warmed they offered to pay for it which is great  Both managers came and said hi and apologized for the slow cook staff and made sure everything was great 

That was the last we saw of them for the next half hour  We finished our meals and 10 minutes later had to flag down a different waitress to go and find our waiter and to bring us cheesecake menus  We always get the Dulce de Leche but they brought us terrimisu or some junk  I gave it back to the waiter after walking the restaurant to hunt him down and said no thanks Ill just pass on the cheesecake  He looked surprised and later said we didnt have to pay for that cheesecake  Well Id sure hope not

Two hours of my life are gone  I usually like this restaurant but tonights service disaster will prevent me from EVER going to this location again free food or not"
5,Hands down the best Vietnamese food weve found in metro Phoenix  Enormous bowls of delicious pho served quickly with friendly and efficient service  Our go to place for pho now  Cheap too
1,"Really if I could I would give this place zero stars because it is a disgrace If you need an emergency vet in the ScottsdaleParadise Valley area go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus40th Sthttpwwwsonoraveterinaryspecialistscom Its also 247 but unlike VCA PVEAH it is a truly valuable legitimate facility and its staffed by engaged committed deeply caring and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel At SVS you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justified

VCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way VCA is in fact the WORST of corporate animal service providers The space is small cheap cramped and the staff are indifferent at best and dont convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress All they want is your money They do NOTHING for the 9975 they charge for an emergency exam We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate literally nothing moreour dog was the exact same bloody traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him backafter making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication  Furthermore they tack on bogus surcharges 525 for a biohazard waste fee that are irrelevant to the service provided and their drug prices are absurd8 for a single Tramadol tablet anyone

Conversely our and our dogs experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful even in the context of an emergency and the cost was ultimately significantly less

VCA is a moneygrubbing depressing sham"
5,Outstanding and fantastalistic comes to mind Real good
5,You dont expect to find a good restaurant in a strip mall next to Costco but Upper Crust is all of that They have fantastic food including fresh made mozzarella made at the restaurant really good chicken wings ask for them crispy and yes great pizza Theres always a happy hour special going on and the bar and restaurant sides are totally separate which is great for both families and the nokid crowd And now that its cooling off you can finally enjoy the patio
5,From the outside you wouldnt guess the kind of school it is  its in a strip mall its small not very well known  but if you took the chance to come inside and see for yourself you would be very surprised and impressed  This is by far the best dojo I have ever run across  You are welcomed when you enter the door all your questions are asked whether they seem stupid or not You are treated kindly and with respect from the get go  a very warm place to walk into  I was so impressed with this place I signed my kids up immediately  They have so many types of classes and the variety and time schedule they really try and have it work around your family so you have your time as well  The teachers here are amazing and always do their best to make it the best class you have every time  I would recommend this dojo to anyone that asks me  and I do  If you havent come into this place and tried it or have your kids try it then you should  you are missing out
5,"Believe the hype Thats all I can say 

This place is the kama sutra of flavor for your taste buds"
5,"I really like this place they have great wine try the tasting it is 10 bucks and you get 5 tastes they make almost all of the wine in house i know the almond champagne is not made there i have not found any wine that i dont like my favorite is their porto and chocolate port

the other thing you can do is have a bottling party  i recently purchased 30 bottles at a great price  cheaper then the wine stores  they make the batch for you and then you have a party to bottle and label it  this is a great and fun different party for you are your friends  

despite it location it is a great place for a date"
5,"Truckin Good Food is by far my favorite part of the Ahwatukee Farmers Market  So far I have tried the Veggie crepe and the Bean and Cheese crepe and both were spectacular  For various reasons it had been about a month since I had been able to meet up with their tent on Sundays and today I got my fix

Jeff and Erin are both so sincere and friendly which makes it easy to hang out and chat while your crepe is made right in front of you  The care and attention put into each and every order really makes TGF stand out from the rest the fresh quality ingredients dont hurt either

Next week Ive got to try the PBJ"
5,"Okay so I admit it Sometimes I get a stubborn idea about not wanting to go to a specific establishment due to a fierce loyalty to one of its competitors It took me a while to cave on this one Too long in fact

Everyone loves Lux and as it happens they have good reason to My latte was supremely delicious The environment is great albeit slightly confusing as far as the flow of service 

I absolutely love the patio area This place definitely has a Pacific Northwest vibe that immediately resonates with me The service was really laid back yet authentically friendly I was far too busy enthusiastically catching up with a dear friend to take in all that Lux has to offer Theres room in my heart for Lux after all so I shall return My primary concerns going in were the coffee service and atmosphere A for all in my humble estimation 

I was a little late to the party but I had a blast anyway"
1,Not worth comin here Im all for food like this but this restaurant sucks They gave me and my dad the wrong meal and the food was not that good The meat was dry and the rice was cold Not worth it
5,great service efficient bartender the place was packed and he flew around that place serving brewskis nonstopawesome outdoor patio and great view of camelbackhappy to see this little gem and will be back
5,The best of all the Harkins Better array of munchies and really friendly staff Also I wasnt overly carded on my inexpensive purchases At the Superstition Springs location Im carded four times between the parking lot and my seat Chances areif I steal a credit card Im not gonna sit in the same spot for three hours awaiting the popo
5,So far I have been to Lola twice a Saturday night and Monday morning Saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy Monday morning Free WiFi coffee baked goods and awesome locationyou cant beat it The morning we went we had a Monterrey Jack scone that was really good I laughed when I got my latte in a So I Married an Axe Murderesque cup We sat along the high tables facing Central Ave and I really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards Central There are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables I really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular youll never get to sit there That is why I stopped going to Lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time My favorite part of Lola coffee is being right on Central and watching traffic and the light rail go past Love it love it
5,This place has really good mexican food and a very nice ambience
5,Finally a place where my kids and I both love the food that doesnt serve chicken nuggets and fries My kids love Blue Burritos kids chicken quesadilla especially the churro that is included I love their salads and taco plates The free chips and salsa bar is a big hit with the family The place is always super clean and the staff is very friendly  The perfect place for lunch on their new patio now that the weather is cooler
5,"So this is my current Sunday All day Happy Hour JAM

This place is SO GOOD and Im not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts

The Chefs Pizza of the day hasnt let me down yet We dont even ask we just order it  The Chefs Board is pretty good too My fav dish right now is the Broccolini  super simple but its just so light  fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini  Meatballs if your their for happy hour 

Awesome open feel to it  super friendly staff The bartenders are great  I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole  works weekends  knows how to make a mean bloodymary  Red Rooster in their case 

The parking  Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says Complimentary not Mandatory  park your car yourself if you want"
5,"We just completed our third tour with Taste It Tours and weve been impressed with all of them  All 3 tours are distinct and are loaded with excellent restaurants  Ive spent quite a bit of time downtown but it can be daunting and I havent ventured much to explore and try new things  The tours take you to the places you may not notice as you whiz by give the history yes Phoenix has history and overall just slow you down to take in the sights sounds and of course food

Cant decide which tour to take  Start with the Original then the warehouse and finally the evening  Really theyre all good  

Tips Have a light snack before starting the tour  Yes you do get a lot of food but keep in mind that the tours start at 2pm or 6pm  You have introductions overview some history and then a short walk to the first restaurant  If youre skipping lunch you might be very hungry when you arrive as the first restaurant  2 Wear comfortable shoes  You will be walking about 2 miles  Nothing strenuous or fast paced but just be conformable also wear comfortable clothing as you will get full  3 Pace yourself  Dont eat everything that is in front of you  Each restaurant gives a fair amount of food now multiply that by 3 more restaurants that remain on the tourYou get the idea  You will be full  

Highly recommend for anyone locals out of town visitors guests of locals team building etc  Really who doesnt like food

Side Note Taste it Tours was founded by a few Phoenix locals who love food and their city  They have only been around about a year now and have been doing extremely well  They base their business around supporting local businesses local supporting local  Im excited to see how well theyve done and wish them all the best More tours are in the works and I will definitely be taking them"
1,"I signed up for Yelp just because of the poor service and being cheated out of money from Cafe Rio I already voiced my complaint to the restaurant and to their website in writing however I havent received a phone call or email back

Ive visited this establishment twice and each time I go I receive very little toppings on my burrito or tacos I understand that its made to your order like Chiptole or Qdoba but theyll add very little cheese or toppings on your food which can cause you to request more To save myself time and every yelpers eyes from reading this long story the individual making my tacos was extremely frugal on the toppings on my tacos She barely put any cheese on my 3 tacos and I simply requested that she could put a little more on the tacos She did and when I went to pay for my order I was charged an extra 95 cents for side cheese The issue isnt the money because eating at Cafe Rio can be expensive for a fastfood mexican restauant but its the principle of charging me extra after I said can you please put a little more cheese on my taco 

This hasnt been the first time this happened but a previous visit had the same result with the sauce on my burrito I thought mexican food restaurants had gigantic burritos and generous size tacos but Cafe Rio will charge you on top of your order if you dont like their skinny tacos

All I ask for from Cafe Rio to acknowledge that when you add more toppings to what the cooks add to your food that they say this will be extra They do this at Chiptole and Qdoba but Cafe Rio would rather screw you over at the end 

I will not be visiting this establishment again As I said its the principle as to why they charged me extra for this not the money"
5,"Even though Ive only been to Bosa once Ive had the donuts from here several times  My parents have been coming here regularly like multiple times a week regularly since this place opened and every time I come to visit they make sure to get me donut in the morning when they know Im hungover in bed

Now Im only reviewing this place for the donuts  I didnt even know this place served other breakfasty stuff until I came here myself but the other pastries  coffee drinks sound good as well  That being said when it comes to donuts Bosa is as good as it gets

Theyre soft chewy and all around yummythat goes for all varieties well the ones Ive tasted anyway  Another good thingtheyre CHEAP  Its not like donuts break the bank anyway but even compared to chain donut places the donuts here practically cost nothing  

The place itself is not much to look at but who cares  All I want is the donuts"
1,"Surprised this place isnt closed by now Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came back

Their ingredients are not fresh gyro meat tastes old and decrepit They really need to hire better pita makers who dont resemble drug addicts and derelicts My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me Literally by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating"
1,I will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude I will not go back  We came in and were given a table menus were practically thrown at us  And then we waited and waited and waited  We asked a woman working there and she apparently did not speak English and indicated a man at the front would help us  But he was too busy talking  We got up and left  No one even said a word when we left
5,"Any parent with young children can vouch for me on this onekeeping the attention of a three year old is to say the least difficult They need constant stimulation otherwise there very well may be hell to pay

Enter the Childrens Museum of Phoenix

The facility is an old school converted into three stories of pure fun and energy 

After you pay your standard 11person older than 1 or your 22 for up to four people with a Groupon you encounter a three story art project that can only be described as AWESOME There are multiple ways in which your children can traverse this mammoth The various pathways challenge children in strength balance and critical thinking skillsall of the ways you want to challenge your child

After your child has lost interest in this room you progress to the second floor Here children get to experiment with a really cool board that can only be described as Plinkoesque Here children can alter the path of a falling object by changing different platforms My daughter thought I was a genius because I was able to predict where her object would land every timeits a shame shell ultimately realize how routine that feat really is  

After Plinko children can either go to the trike wash build forts or they can head to the art room After some laps through the wash my daughter wanted to head into the art room Being that we went right before Halloween our child had the opportunity to make black play dough to make spiders she got to paint on a giant rocket ship and then she was able to make a spooky tree out of a brown paper bag Such simple activitiessuch great opportunities

After cleaning all of the paint from her smock we made the journey upto the third floor Here children get to play grownups Theres a mock supermarket that allows children to either shop ring up merchandise or work in the stock room of a miniature grocery store

After shopping our daughter wanted to work at the little ice cream stand located just outside of the grocery We had fake ice cream cones and sat at the tiny bistro set while we watched children make their way through the noodle forest We then made our way to the end of the hall to race miniature race cars on roller skate wheels

Being only three floors our day at the museum only lasted a couple of hoursbut in those short hours my daughter never stopped smiling

How on earth could you rate any place less than five stars when it brings so much joy to YOUR pride and joy"
5,"I found this place completely by accident and it was great  I have been going pretty much once a week since discovering taco caliente I love that you can choose from about 45 different meats and everything is completely fresh  Nothing is fried  The service is good and the owner always stops to chit chat with me  The salsa bar is pretty good and the hot is actually hot  Love it  Cant wait to go this week  
The only thing is that I wish they were open later but I know they just opened recently  Hopefully theyll extend their hours soon "
5,"Great service Great Value Best in the valley hands down 

I am a second generation customer and as far as i can remember my mom has always took my clothes here from my 8th grade promotion dress my HS prom dress my college graduation dress and now i take my husbands suits here 

Park Avenue has been there for all of my wonderful growing years and hopefully will be here for my future children as well"
1,My mother always told me if I didnt have anything nice to say say nothing
5,great place to go and the pizza ia great too
1,"A couple Saturdays ago went with my mom to get my name added to her accounts should the unthinkable happen We first went to Chase which took all of ten minutes The personal banker was great  inoutdone  Then we headed to her Credit Union at approximately 1000 AM They were quite busy apparently When we checked in I heard grumbling from other customers and asked the wait time  I was told there were two people ahead of us in line and it shouldnt be long

30 minutes later my mom went to ask how much longer it would take Jennfer who was manning the reception desk dismissed her rudely in front of a lobby of customers My mom is as sweet as tea in Tennesee so to hear her called out in front of a lobby of people as a disruption was upsetting  45 minutes later I went up to ask if it would be much longer Jennifer said curtly Were busy Apparently on Saturdays theyre busy and one should avoid transacting business there on the weekend I dont recall being spoken to so rudely at even a fast food restaurant in recent years

Another ten minutes or so went by as did my deadline to make another appointment I had made I was told it would be two more minutes as I had to go through their background check to be a member They were having a difficult time with my Washington Driver License and the weird characters it has an asterisk in part of the number After all was said and done over an hour later I was approved to be a member and was successfully put as a signer on my moms account

I asked for Jennifers card as I told her I was not happy with the way she had spoken to me or my mother and I intended to speak with her manager  To that I received a reply she did not have one The woman sitting next to her informed me she was the assistant manager and that they were busy on Saturdays My biggest beef was this If it was going to be an hour to speak with someone tell me I can make other arrangements or come in during the week Being told first It shouldnt be long and then Were busy is not an excuse If the business is so overwhelming on Saturdays perhaps it would be wise to staff more people extend the hours or inform people of the wait theyre likely to experience because of the queue Or dont open on Saturdays

As a 20 year veteran of the service industry I am very disappointed at the level of service Arizona Federal Credit Union provided my mom and me but also all the other people I watched be dismissed like the Credit Union was doing them a favor After doing some searching for a new home for moms money she can get a much better rate at a four letter word forthcoming BANK

Im normally a big fan of memberowned institutions but based on the incredibly rude serviced I received from Arizona Federal Credit Union Id say go to a Credit Union or Bank where the employees actually read the mission statement that is painted on the wall behind them"
5,"One of my fave places in Phoenix
Well stocked and friendly staff
I dont normally peruse the DVDs or CDs because they tend to be priceybut one day I just decided to take a look
Thats when Borders became one of my fave places
I was able to find a fairly rare documentary DVD
I paid 40 bucks for itbut have never seen it offered for sale anywhere before
I very much appreciate a business who refuses to cowtow to the ridiculousness of political correctness
For that alone was well worth paying 40 bucks for
I was even more impressed by the staffer who rang up my purchase for not only being knowledgable about the DVD but letting me know they had a biography of the director of the film that had just come in
Even though the shipment had not been tagged and put on the floor for sale yetthe staffer called to have someone open the boxand bring a copy for me to look at
I bought that too
I will coninue to patronize Borders and any other book store that chooses not to censor"
1,Forget the yogurt and the berry berry bad service The OCD worker with shadow you and serve you a sample with a glaring stare Youll never feel so ackward adding your toppings since shell trail behind you and fix the spoons Yogurt sucks as much as the service so I dont recommend
1,"This is going to be brutal  Hide the children

If youve been to Chipotle youll feel right at home at Qdoba That is until you start eating Complete and utter ripoff of the concept except for the part that matters  the execution  Where Chipotle succeeds Qdoba fails miserably  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier  The burritos are just plain bad  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat  basically the opposite of what youll get at the other place  On top of that the rice and beans were the suck  And if you know Brak you know that he LOVES his beans  But not these  About all theyre good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap

If you want to know the root cause of this debacle check out who the parent company is  its Jack In The Crack®  Pretty much explains it all

Avoid at all costs  Receives Braks dreaded zerostar review rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesnt allow a zero"
5,"Having spent lots of time in Sonora Mexico over the years visiting family I have always sought a place here in Arizona that provides an honest and quality duplication of the food I have had south of the border At Sonora Mesquite Grill I have found such a place that makes food on the spot using only fresh ingredients and genuine care for your experience You can always go elsewhere and maybe get your food faster maybe have a plasma TV in your face but Im willing to bet that your food started out frozen and going through a thawing process in a microwave 

Celina the kind and welcoming owner wants people to receive the absolute best food possible This painstaking process means long hours for her every day preparing the beef and chicken over a mesquite fire No there are no large corporate chain gimmicks or cut corners Sonora Mesquite Grill simply provides good food at a good price without the use of preservatives and loads of fat Is Sonora Mesquite Grill for everyone Perhaps not but it is a great choice for someone looking for genuinely authentic modest great tasting and healthy food with the taste of Sonora 

If going for the first time make sure to order the silky and flavorful guacamole and salsas Finish your meal with a fresh and homemade razpado to truly cap off a great meal at Sonora Mesquite Grill Simple and great flavors at their very best"
5,The food was absolutely delicious  Was very surprised in finding a good Asian restaurant here in Phoenix  We had the papaya salad with soft shell crab Phnom Penh noodle soup and the lehong noodles  All were delicious and very SE Asian  I could not believe how great the food was  But the best part was the grass jelly drink  it brought me back to my childhood  Cant wait to try the other dishes here  A definite must try here in Phoenix
5,I just got back from my first visit ti Jacks All In Social Club Ill be go back I found the place a nice place to play a hand or two of Texas Holdem poker The owners are nice couple want to provide a nice clean and safe place to play poker They have succeed
5,"When was the last time that you went to a restaurant and were still bragging about your experience two weeks later This is exactly what I am doing about the Arrogant Butcher

I went there a couple of weeks ago with a bunch of folks from work We had a private dining area and our servers name was Mark He truly made the experience AMAZING  His detailed vivid descriptions of the entrees and desserts were comical and had most of us in tears You could almost smell and taste each item as he passionately went into detail  The appetizer soft pretsels with cheeseOH EM GEE  Why doesnt every restaurant have these The crab stuffed chickenAMAZING

We shared several desserts one which was a peanut butter cupstand back Reesesyou have competition now 

The manager came in later and had a professional yet funny manner about him as well  What a great team they are"
5,Love love love this place
5,Great eats at this joint New York strip was awesome Pear salad was bomb and service was superb Ill be back march 10th
5,The Culinary Dropout  you get the best of both worlds The food is off the hook its great the service these ladies and guys take care of your every need and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in Phoenix entertaining you while you dinneCheck it outBluesman Mike
5,I was craving some sweets today and told my husband about this place Apparently one needs to make an appointment but my husband made one right away when he called We got a Baileys cupcake a chocolate cupcake and a carrot cupcake all of them were DELICIOUS Seriously most gluten free pastries are horrible but these were great We will definitely be going there frequently
5,"Not being a big fan of chain restaurants I wasnt super excited to eat here last night I was however starving and craving mexican food and wanting to try somewhere new so we ended up at Manuels 

OMG I loved it The salsas especially the hot the chips the cheese crisp with green chiles and onions and most of all the chilaquiles I LOVE chilaquiles so much and had mostly seen them only served at breakfast until I opened up Manuels menu and there they were just how I like them SO good I wouldve licked the dish they were served in if I wasnt so full afterwards

JD had a rolled quesadilla that was fantastic too and we both needed to be rolled out of there when we finished eating It was so good though that Im craving it again today We will definitely be back"
5,"This is the only Ben and Jerrys that has successfully withheld the recession in AZ  This means that this is the only one left as well  Its located in a beautiful plaza called El Pedregal  They have live music on Sundays  I found out this information from the friendly owner who told about the history of the store since I asked him if their location was really the only one open in all of AZ

The location is very North Scottsdale  I am not sure how it does for business it is far from commercial areas  On my drove over I mostly noticed many well built homes  

This is the only Ben and Jerrys left and I strongly encourage those who enjoy this ice cream to go out and support their business"
5,"They had Kool Aid i was so happy to see it 

The chicken and waffles were really good my girlfriend and I went straight there from the airport before going to our hotel and it was completely worth it 

yeah waiting outside in 100 degree heat isnt ideal but for 10 minutes you can deal with it especially when they had someone outside giving out water

If youre ever in Phoenix like us or live out there definitely stop in"
1,"PIECE OF  manager wouldnt put air conditioning on yesterday It was 90
They just lost alot of business"
5,Postinos is a great date restaurant Especially on Mondays and Tuesdays when they have their 20 bruschetta and bottle of wine special You can choose any bottle of wine off of their fairly long list of wines and get a delicious board of bruschetta for only 20 Major win The proscuitto and fig is my absolute favorite followed by the artichoke brie and apple and salmon and capers The restaurant has a great interior and patio with a huge wall glass garage door that opens up to connect the interior to the exterior when the weather is nice If you join their mailing list you get a free bruschetta board on your birthday and the restaurants birthday I also love their sea salt caramel sunday  its the most delicious dessert ever You have to try this place Its just great
5,This is my current first choice in eateries  The spring rolls are made with rice paper and such an array of fresh bite sized vegetables it melts in your mouth and there are so many different kinds ave price 3400  Did I say they are HUGE  Its a weight watchers dream  Everything on the menu that we have tried has been delicious and presented beautifully  The sauces accompanying each dish are always intrigueing and tasty as all get out  The best thing of all though is the Ginger Creme Brule  Wow sir  It doesnt get better than that  If you like Viet food Thai food or just plain fresh good food then this Vietnamese restaraunt should pique your interest  My goal is to try everything on the menu
5,"This wasnt the first time but we went to Tutti Santi for a family Christmas Eve Dinner  All I have to say is that everything was simply perfect  Not only the food but the service  Which to me makes a restaurant with great food go from good to great  

I ate the lamb shank Angello Dorato which fell off the bone and was delicious I cleaned the plate 

Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo  The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right The sauce was not too thicknot to thin  Dad cleaned the plate  From him being in the food industry for 30years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago believe me that says more than alot   

Mom had the special of the night which was a cioppino with tons of seafood  When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting not in a good way especially the mussels  Not here Everything was the way it should be I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes   Mom didnt clean the plate she has a small stomach  But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal

Everything from the bread the calamari fritti to the tiramisu was fabulous  Im glad we couldnt get reservations anywhere else for this special meal
  
Gratzi and Buon Natale

Oh yeah I didnt get the raviolis this time but if youve havent had them its a must try"
5,"Deceptively fantastic Like Lady Gaga Pizza A Metro is the Lady Gaga of midrange Italian restaurants

Its so unassuming from the outside that I was pumped when pulling up Oh man Ben we could get in a knife fight at a location like this Sweeet

Its not that bad But the food is righteous The premeal bread with the tomato  balsamic  red onion deliciousness was such a great alternative to the typical bread and oil We split the antipasti yes the portions are comically large we maybe cleared a layer a delicious delicious layer of very fresh yummy artichoke hearts prosciutto wrapped canteloupe and a smattering of other favorites We then had the pizza with sausage and broccoli Perfect cheese perfect crust yum sausage perfectly crunchy fresh broccoli

Its clean and warm on the inside Try it You like it And tell no one that I mentioned liking Lady Gaga"
5,Hate long lines at the DMV  Hate dealing with the DMV for any reason Then you should check out Desert Title Service  I had a complicated Title transfer and was dreading spending 4 hours at the DMV office the last day of the month but I knew I had to do it  So today my daughter and I went over to DMV and waited an hour before deciding to call Desert Title Service  Had I known I could go in to a place with no lines get a title release and a title transfer I would have checked them out sooner  I called their office while sitting in the DMV and drove over  In less then 15 minutes I had the title released and the title transferred  Daughter had new plates and her title in less then 5  If you need anything to do with your car I urge you to call them andor visit their office  You will be surprised at how fast and efficient their office is  I will never visit the DMV unless I have to
1,"If we were able to give 0 stars I would ask to give 1

I live nearby and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood

Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting so was the process of watching the barista make my drink

They use hersheys chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle  Disgusting  

The espresso shot was made without care or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door  Possibly way before the barista started her shift   Gross

And finally  The milk  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand  This was a huge red flag  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks  Well both were accomplished 

The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use 
Which is FREAKIN  DISGUSTING

I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha and threw it away after taking a sip  

Hundreds of businesses in the area close down every year and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts  AND I really dont understand why this place hasnt joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line  

If you own a coffeeshop  Coffee should be your passion  
If you own a bait shop  Fishing should be your passion
If you just want to open up a business that mirrors a nearby popular chain short tall grande please stop wasting space in the strip mall and get a day job in a cubicle

Never going back warning my friends about this place and am probably going to contact the health department on Monday"
5,So my friends and I had to roll each other out of the door after this meal was over but it was sooooooooo worth it BEST red koolaid ever served in jars BEST waffles Ive EVER had BEST red velvet cake Ive EVER had I also did enjoy their chicken mac  cheese and collard greens but none were the best Ive ever had but very good  I seriously dream about their waffles and red velvet cake I dont know what magic mix of ingredients make up the waffle batter but its absolutely perfect and these waffles would stand deliciously on their own even without butter and syrup but whod want to do that the red velvet slice they give you is HUGE and soooo moist the frostings is cream cheesy delicousness I can not wait to indulge in this treat again but since Im far from being the only one who loves this place it is always packed and the wait is long at least on the weekend Seriously considering taking a day off of work just for a weekday Lo Los run P
1,"The food was decent however I am writing about their underhanded business practices
I ordered a travelzoo voucher for 69 that included 2 3 course meals It said Regularly 140 What we ordered if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about 100 However we were charged tax on the full 140 

Second even though on the voucher it says PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity 18 gratuity 18 of 140 even though we ordered 100 worth of food at the most was automatically added to our check

Third even if you had ordered the most expensive options the highest possible amount it could be worth is 120 not 140 It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a 140 value but that is what they add tax and tip to

Fourth after we told our waiter we were using a voucher he seemed less interested in the service level of our table which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18 of 140 tip

I just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal 79  AWARDWINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 WWINE REG 165 I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher they will read this first before they purchase it"
5,Gotta love a place open late in Phoenix 250 petite martinis after midnite yes please
5,Love this place  Buffalo chicken breast on a pretzel bun was amazing Love the atmosphere too
1,"This review is based on delivery service and food quality as delivered

Second and last time I will be ordering from this place The first time they forgot a few items and were very off for delivery time 

Tonight I Ordered at 1103 PM estimated delivery at 1150 updated to 1154 PM from a whopping 15 miles away to add 1154 comes and goes Call them at 1207 AM now I am told they are on their way 15 miles away keep in mind Call back at 1240 AM to cancel my order as I do not want to eat at 100 AM They actually come to deliver while I am on hold waiting at 1244 AM My hot sub is ice cold theres nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 100 AM on a Monday now Tuesday nightif you are going to take nearly 2 hours to deliver this at least make sure the temperature is somewhat close to where it is supposed to benever again silver minenever again

This place probably has a good taste potential Unfortunately like most hot food the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sitsin a fridge alley or wherever they decided to leave it for nearly 2 hours If you feel the need to get food from herefor the love of sub kings please just DONT GET DELIVERY"
5,"This was the marriage of two of my favorite things alcohol and ice cream  As Charlie Sheen would say Winning

I had a groupon so Laura A and I went to try out this amazing place  The groupon got us each two scoops so we went with 4 different so we could sample the most possible  I got the Apple Pie  Spiced Rum and Black Raspberry  Chambord Liqueur  Both were awesome I actually enjoyed the Chambord the most but I was in ice cream heaven  

Laura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita  Tequila  I really enjoyed both of hers the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav  The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about 11am on a Saturday  just sayin  

I have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and cant wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didnt see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great  

I hope that eventually I can find a pinapple upside down cake with rum flavor"
5,Old school style butcher shop that has great service and a great selection  You will pay more but you can sign up for their emails and get the monthly and weekend specials  Often there are coupons for BOGO or a few bucks off your purchase  They also have a good selection of beer and wine side dishes and some supplies for home BBQ and smoking  After reading the other reviews I know my hubby and I need to try the jerky  We always enjoy shopping at Von Hansons
1,the owner was dishonest she posted a menu outside with lower pricing to attarct traffic and then charge higher pricing menu inside she also charge me 12 sales tax which is illegal in tempe which suppose to be only 93 very rude manner not recommended
1,"Only reason for 1 star is cause I got arrested here for underaged drinking years ago

I blame the Diamondbacks for no legitimate reason"
5,"After flying across the country we were hungry and as Ive done in many other cities I went in search of pho  

I ordered the pho dac biet  The broth was not oily and packed with flavor  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon"
5,Puttanesco pizza artichokes was delicious and the service is all very quaint and efficient They even have gluten free pizza crust Happy hr drink is 100 off all drink choices which I love since I can order whatever I like
5,What can I say about Execucar I love their service It cost just as much if not cheaper than taking a cab for me I make a reservation online get confirmation via email as well as a phone call the day before confirming my reservation The cars are always nice clean and fresh smelling yes that may seem weird but I have been in some cabs that were like WHOA The drivers are always in shirts ties and slacks and they are professional and courteous I have never had a driver be late knock on wood and they have always gotten me to the airport ontime Plus I get some frequent flyer miles added to my USAirways account for using them Can we say bonus
5,"Since I have ranted recently on poor customer service and in the spirit of balance here is a shining example of how easy it really is

Late last summer  I came home and was shocked to see two of my sunscreens looking quite vandalized Upon further inspection it appeared that while using a back mounted leaf blower one of the landscape crew had brushed against them The exhaust pipe must have ripped and burned the screen material as well It was quite the nasty burned melted scar

 After staring at it for several hours I realized there was no virgin Mary no Jesus hell it just looked like burned grilled cheese without any deity or lesser apparitions whatsoever regardless of the angle or my squint So deciding there was no money to made on eBay I set out to get them repaired

Did some online searching and decided to call AmeriZona I explained the situation and was told they could repair them but I would have to bring them in These are some pretty large sun screens mind you and packing them into the convertible would have been a challenge

While pondering what to do the person helping me on the phone asked me if I could hold on I could tell it was one of those thinking on your feet light bulb went off type can you hold requests

She came back on the phone informed me that she had a crew that was working close by and that she would ask one of the crew to swing by and pick up the screens for repair She could not promise when they would be repaired but for that convenience alone I was on board She had already quoted me the price to repair the screens and it was very reasonable considering some other online comparisons

Someone showed up within a few hours to pick up the screens He could not have been more accommodating and it was obvious this guy had been working all day and was on his way home 

A few days later Mark  phoned me to tell me my screens were ready and to tell me he was going to drop them off on his way home Needless to say Mark was also very pleasant to deal with I believe he was at the time the sales manager 

When he arrived the screens looked great matched the color of the others even with the sun bleaching over several years He even offered to put them in 

This experience was way beyond any customer service expectations No extra charges for any of the above and beyond the call of duty efforts Outstanding and quite refreshing"
5,They really do a great job and you will really pay for it I dont have incredibly pricey clothing so getting my 50 blouses dry cleaned here just doesnt make sense but I would absolutely trust them with very important articles nice sport coats lined trousers wedding gowns blood soaked mattresses haha kidding
5,Old school steak house  Best 22oz ribeye Ive had in years  Bread drenched in broth was curiously delicous  Waitstaff hustled  THe only aspect was the salad a waste but at Durants there is so much good meat why waste it on vegiies
5,"Get your passport were going to Mexico

Cant find your passport  Still waiting for it from the State Department  No worries pack your bag and head to the Ranch Market

This place is the best  The food court is wonderful with so many tasty dishes  And the produce department is crazy  2 lbs of grapes for 99 cents 8 cucumbers for a dollar 17 cents for a bunch of cilantro 7  YES SEVEN pounds of watermelon for 99 cents  You can go crazy with produce and not break the bank  

The tamales are huge and the tortillas oh the tortillas 

Dont be frightened dont get intimidated its just a grocery store people"
5,This place is the best They stopped doing tacos but if your lucky they do have them call before you go Some outside seating picnic tables no seating inside Take away onlyThey also have another location Yea In a strip mall on 51 ave  orangewood They do serve tacos at this location
5,I came here today for a manicure and pedicure I have been here quite a few times it is a place my girlfriends like to come to so when I want to hang with my girlfriends and get a manipedi this is where we meet  Although today I was solo  The ladies here do a really good job my manicures always last a really long time and they are really nice and accommodating  Today I had one girl doing my pedicure and another doing my manicure now that is what I call service  I was out of there in a hour  They do not have a tip line on credit or debit so bring cash for the tip  Today I did not have cash  i forgot  they were so nice they said next time I come I can tip then if I want  I came back anyway to tip them because it was so fast and my nails look great  Oh another thing I forgot to mention is they use the hot rocks for the massage part for both the manicure and the pedicure and the callous remover is part of the cost of the pedicure  Total for both services including getting french manicure on toes and fingers was 4200
5,Wow  I enjoyed staying here  Huge rooms  We had three adults and two children and everyone had plenty of room  Highly recommended
5,"I have been here 2x since moving down here from cali bay area I am a coffee snob and I really fit in here The staff is very cute and helpful
The people in the shop remind me of the bay area
I drink americanos and the beans being used are very robust and smooth
The menu selection is nice for the food fair and I really enjoy the general atmosphere

I strongly recommend this cafe

1,Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service  If I want low prices I will go to goodwill over this place  Looks like Dillards is on my list of do not shop
1,This was by far the worst restaurant experience Ive ever had  I paid 2000 for a show and dinner I received the show only because it was from an outside source The show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant Id say 50 to 80 people still had not been served They didnt have enough menus for people to even order off of Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table The show started at 700 at 930 I still had no food The people who did get food complained that it was terrible Maybe I should be happy I didnt get any food When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying fk those people no more orders not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 1100  Seriously Ive never had such a bad experience in my life Can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund unbelievable
5,"I LOVE this bar My first visit was in 2004 when it was known as Bar Nun Id just moved to AZ and I was drawn in by the neon green light and funny name Little did I know it was the beginning of a love affair 

Since I didnt know anyone yet I went by myself and sat at the bar The staff was friendly and so were the patrons Some of the patrons turned out to be a little too friendly and the bartender Jennifer insisted that the barback walk me to my car to ensure my safety As if that wasnt enough to make a fan out of me I found out they serve 2 Blue Moons all day Saturday and the food is awesome

The burgers are great and you can order them rare if you like I also became addicted to their BBQ chicken sandwich And the wings Theyll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus In fact I dont thing there is anything that I have tried and disliked here

ThursdaySunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band Usually classic rock or 80s stuff They also have NTN and a ton of TVs if youre into sports

I was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment I made sure my new house was within walking distance Not that youd need to walk since half the year it is hot as hell even at 2am I can see why you wouldnt want to walk they offer a free ride program on the weekends where theyll pick you up and drop you off That way you dont have to worry about Sheriff Joe and wearing pink undies at Tent City

Wow I kinda wanna move back now CKs I miss you"
5,Thank God there were some Mesa firemen standing outside this place when I pulled up as my wife was very uneasy about exiting our car and heading in  Even trying to explain how fellow Yelpers loved it did not ease her fears  After a unanimous Defnitely its awesome amongst the three battlers of the flame in response to my Is this place worth going to we parked the car and walked on in  This place is a definite hole in the wall read DUMP and Iwe LOVED it  Great chicken tacos awesome machaca shredded beef burros delicious chorizo and the tamales were equally spectacular homemade of course  Its located in a somewhat dicey area of Phoenix due west of the airport but its totally worth going to  It has become my new first stop after I get off the plane at Sky Harborunless I land too late at night
5,Have been here twice Everything is excellent as far as food quality  Its pretty busy on most evenings and that can slow things down so if you think you might be in a hurry I would recommend something else Service has been outstanding each time that I have been  The food is good and they have a reasonably diverse wine lists with mostly national wine offerings The prime rib is superb Most meals will cost in the range of 1530 dollars depending on pairings and wo drinks Definitely worth it for a nice night out
5,Yeah its BBBwhat else to say
5,Great place for a home office morning One of my favorite places  indoor  outdoor seating Always busy  they offer breakfast  lunch their food is awesome Very generous portions
5,Best gyro in town We go for the lunch special during the work week quite often I havent been for dinner but if its half as good as their lunch gyro then you wont be disappointed Service is great and they always take good care of us
1,"This is the worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to I was upcharged for something I didnt order When I asked for it to be corrected it was done wrong again given the wrong change and had the drive thru door slammed in my face Asked to speak to the manager and he was extremely hostile He took my change receipt and food After some time I asked for a refund and was told that wasnt possible too much paperwork Asked for his supervisors number and was told he was the highest manager there was no one above him Right 

I went to the next Pizza Hut and asked for the regional manager number I left the food at the restaurant because I was no comfortable eating it after he took it back to correct their mistake Not sure what could have been done to it

The young girl at the window did get it wrong twice but the example the store manager gives is piss poor and is the issue I hope Pizza Hut sees who they have working for them and speaking on their behalf because according to this store manager Tim hes the owner and CEO of the company I highly doubt that"
5,I love scallops and the scallops at The Breadfruit were simply the best On the weekend The Breadfruit is open till 11pm and its Rum Bar is open till midnight which makes this a great latenight haunt pick your favorite rum drink and share a scallop appetizer for the perfect lite end to the evening The servers were excellent and handled my gluten allergy easily offering suggestions and slight modifications to the dishes The Breadfruit is located at 108 East Pierce which is south of Roosevelt and just east of First Street Put this place as a must on your latenight hit list
5,"This place hits everything on my its Awesome list 
First off its a family run little place
Second its in a hole in the wall area
Thirdly and most importantly it is all made in house 
Fourtherly it is awesome

We were in Gilbert staying at a friends house for spring training GO DODGERS We hit the usuals Waffle House Dunkin Donuts Dodger Dogs at the game and our friends asked do you like sandwiches
If there is one food group that I love it has to be the Sandwich group and 
this place is one of my top 5 sandwiches stops of all time

We ate in the Loungeyie area which has a more adult vibe going on We first started with their fresh bread and tomato basalmic vinegar salsay thing Which was great we had two rounds of that while we drank our beverages and waited on our sandwiches

I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the potato salad and the wife ordered the Chicken breast sandwich with pasta salad My sandwich came out perfectly from the fresh Ciabatta Bread to the outstanding roasted pork 

I would order this pork just by itself it was juicy and full of flavor just like my Cuban grandmother makes While this sandwich is a true Cuban sandwich not using swiss and not being pressed it is not advertised as an actual Cuban just a Cuban style like me

Now this potato salad was some of the best I have ever had and not just because it had bacon which is awesome but the use of yukon gold potatoes instead of red or russets has been a revelation to me This is how I am going to prepare all off my potato salads from now on

After all that I still ordered the carrot cake which like everything else is made in house with local ingredients it was warm with a not overly sweet cream cheese frosting The wife got the lava cake with some beer ice cream Even though I ate most of my carrot cake and loved it I wish I had a full gallon of that beer ice cream it was just perfect In fact I am planning another trip out that way just for that ice cream"
5,My husband and I chose Binkleys for our 5th anniversary dinner We dont usually spend that much on a meal but for a special occasion we decided to splurge and we are soooo glad we did We decided to do the 4 course tasting meal and with the many amuse bouches throughout the meal we left so full I couldnt even finish my wonderful seared foie gras The atmosphere was cosy and inviting the wait staff friendly and helpful The three hours we spent enjoying our meal was well spent We would both like to revisit and enjoy another taste adventure with this lovely resturant
5,They have a mechanical bull  Need I say more
5,Probably the most serious restaurant for food in Scottsdale  Great attention to detail from the chefs management and servers  Shin does warm up after a few visits  weve been there probably 10 times in the last 18 months  ShinBay is a must for anyone truly into food  Given the ingredients  both the sheer number of them and the overall quality I would actually call the pricing here a downright bargain
5,"Ive been a patient of PFD for a few years recommended by a friend and have always been happy with the attention Ive gotten I actually go to the Gilbert location now but I have been to the Tempe office once and had a good experience there 

Its a family owned business I think theyve been around for 30 years They have always been pleasant and honest when talking teeth I wanted to mention my hygienist specifically Jackie She is super nice calm and gentle which is important to me since I dont particularly like going to the dentist 

Check them out if youre in the market for a dentist"
5,"i love the army but they make me wake up wicked early  then i work work work and when lunch rolls around me want tasty goodness FAST  mamma mias is the solution

i got their 2 slice deal mushrooms  this cost me 4that alone makes it rockstar but you have to ask yourselfdoes it get any better  oh yes it does  the crust was crunchy the cheese ooeygooey and the mushrooms PLENTIFUL which made me disgustingly happy  i think pizza places never put enuf mushroomstoday i met my match

the joint is hoppin but they still manage to get you out in about 10 minutes  plus you get to stare at frank sinatra while you wait young cute blue eyes not the older less attractive version and listen to the tv blaring  and if you are me the QUEEN of movie trivia you enjoy your wait as a time to school coworkers in the Game while you wait for your AWESOME slices

moral of the story go young ones and enjoy  the food is plentiful and cheap atmosphere friendly but small  its easy to missKEEP YOUR EYES PEELED"
5,Great Great Great salon They offer all sorts of services and Karyn one of the nail techs is amazing Im a little obsessive with perfection when it comes to my nails and she does an absolute perfect job Pays so much attention to detail She is always creative and can make designs if you wish She has many many color options I would recommend EVERYONE to her and this salon Plus they won Best Salon in the East Valley
5,The grooming salon at this location does an amazing job with pets Yesterday was the 2nd time my baby was groomed here by Chip  I hope I spelled his name correctly hes just wonderful  Hes very patient and very kind with my Sushipoo and Im comfortable leaving him in Chips hands
5,Been here a few times and each time it its the best Thai food I have had in Az Service has been consistently great Has a full bar with some good specialty drinks that sometimes take some time to make but are worth the wait Lots of mid day food and drink specials Ive tried six dishes here every one has been excellent Portion sizes are about on par with the average of the many Thai restaurants Ive tried in the east valley while menu prices are below the average I think Thai Spices offers a good value for some great food and drink and I cant wait to come back
1,Im convinced that anyone giving this airline more than one star is most likely associated with them and is concerned about their job  Ive been flying with them for 7 years back to NC to see my aging mother  I fly 3Xyear on the same flights  The service and attitude of the employees has been getting progressively worse  I am also a pilot 20 years and I understand the weather and air traffic control VERY well  This rant is not about operations security or delays  It is about the customer service by pissed off employees  My wife said that if she was not with me on my last trip she would not have believed what happened  I forgot to purchase my own bottle of water before getting on the plane in Charlotte  The beverage service was 2 hours into the flight  This old cranky b came by and said what do you want  I said I would like to have a soda and a water  She said you can only have one or the other  I was so thirsty I asked for the water  It was a very small glass that I drank very fast and then ask for a refillplease  She said I told you that you could only have one  and pushed the cart away  Even the people around me were in shock  The check in personal were equally as rude  If you are watching the internet news there was an article a few weeks back that rated customer satisfaction and US Airways was at the bottom  I for one will never fly with them again
5,"ive been eating at bison witches for 7 years now  i started in tucson when i went to UA and even though this one is on ASUs campus ill go because the food is that good
i almost always get the soup and sandwhich combo  the sundevil in tucson its the wildcat and the cream of brocolli soup  yummm  they give you plenty of soup in a bread bowl and if youre like me and like to dip they give you the top of the bread bowl that they cut off  they also give you the insides of the bread bowl too  as everyone else has said the sandwhiches are huge  you could order just half a sandwhich and be good but you would be missing out on some deliciousness  and you get all this food for just 775 when i first started eating here it was only 650 which was perfect for the poor college kid
ive also had their chicken cheese nachos which is a cafeteria tray filled with tortilla chips covered in lettuce tomatoes queso and cubes of chicken  its an appetizer but could definitely serve as a meal for 2
also tasty their chili and chili con queso  yummm"
5,Best Subway anywhere Superfriendly staff and always really clean
1,Our family made the mistake of dining here on Thanksgiving Everything from the table to the food to the clueless and absent waiter was outright below average and certainly no where near the kind of restaurant described in the other reviews which I wonder now if were written by the owner or manager What a disappointing holiday
5,I have visited a few nail spas in Scottsdale and I like this one the best   They do the best work and they dont rush  The environment is clean and well decorated  They dont try to pressure you to get little designs on your nails At least from my experience If you want to chat theyll chat If you want to zone out and enjoy your pedicure theyll let you Just try to book your appointment in advance They have availability for walkins sometimes but your best bet is to secure your own spot
5,"I have been to a great many Ross store and I can safely say that this one is my favorite Even when it is busy it is still manageable unlike some of the others 

I am also consistently pleased with their selection Now I often go in there without much of a purpose just to see whats there but I recently found ALL thats right all of my Christmas gifts Perhaps I went in on a lucky day but I cant think of a time when I didnt walk out of there with at least something

I was sorry to read the previous review because I have had such a consistently good time at this store As for the store having a security guard the one who works most of the time is a kick in the pants Hell chat with you if given the opportunity Also every Ross has at least one if not two security guards working while the store is open 

I hope more of you are encouraged to visit now that you know what a great time I have had there Its one of the smaller Ross stores that I have been in but it certainly packs a punch Happy bargaining"
5,"The closest thing I have to a neighborhood pub  Not bad

They sell loads of Belgian and Canadian beer  That is all that you need to know"
5,Saw CAKE there last year  Nice grass beautiful venue great night
5,"I really adore this place Theyve got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very very juicy I recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork Their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly 

Last time I was in I noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the parkandride light rail station right in front of their restaurant

Do yourself the favor If youre heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike stop off here and enjoy a nice meal They have good lunch specials around 750 for a full plate with meat hummus garlic sauce pita and tabouli Mmmm"
5,I LOVE BURRITO EXPRESS My fiance has been going with his friends since they were in high school and he finally took me to try the only thing his group ever orders a steak potato and cheese burrito EPIC This burrito was so awesome that they have never tried anything else on the menu and I feel the exact same way The tortilla is huge and fresh and the burrito itself is gigantic I can never finish mine but the boys seem to eat it right up Dont leave this place without trying the horchata either its so good Ive been to other Mexican places like this and the horchata tasted like gross water Burrito Express however does it right and I will always go back to this place whenever Im up for the BEST BURRITO EVER
5,"This is probably one of the more unique trendy looking places in Phoenixmetro to lounge at  Everything about AZ88 is eyecandy literally from the furniture to the drinks to the decor and of course the patrons  Drinks are made really really tasty  My usual choice of cocktail is the French 75  My goto appetizer is either the waffle fries that comes with three flavorful dipping sauces or the shrimp ceviche The menu is pretty diverse with a little flair

What makes this place a hit for me are the contemporary artsy decor making it a refreshing scene to come to compared to other Phoenixish ambiance  Of course you cant have all these modern sophisticated attributes without a DJ playing fresh beats and sounds 

Bottom line is the look and the vibe makes me feel like I am back in New York or Los Angeles  I had given a 4star prior but I can honestly say AZ88 can hang with the big boys"
5,"Fantastic place to learn Krav Maga and workout My two sons have been going to React Defense Systems RDS for years and they finally convinced me to go I love it and its too bad I didnt go earlier 

The instructors and facility are top notch As a beginner the instructors made me feel welcome and motivated even though my skills were untrained After two weeks I can feel see and hear the difference I love smacking the bag with sweaty fists and feet and seeing the sweat fly 

If you are looking for intense conditioning then RDS is the place If you are looking for life saving skills then RDS is still the place Learn a great life skill become fitter and have fun 

I agree with AZ Central RDS is the best boxingmartial art facility in Arizona 

In closing Id recommend RDS to anyone and I apologize to everyone for not being creative enough to think of something funny or flippant 

Oh did I mention this is one of the few places in the world where parents and their kids can legally beat on each other and enjoy it When was the last time your son hit you "
5,What a dream come true to traipse into this store with my toddler girl and my husband The store is filled ceiling to floor with all varieties of toys for all age groups Shelves upon shelves of brands and models youve likely never seen if your main toyshopping stomping grounds are Toys R Us or Walmart The stores management clearly has a relaxed attitude about children playing in the store  toys are sprawled across the store  ready for the next childs little hands Yet it didnt feel messy in there The aisles are wide and smooth The store is organized into various zones Dolls science blocks books baby etc  This is an absolute oasis in suburbia land where youre always hardpressed to find nonchain stores
5,My wife and I just got married at Blackstone and Im still amazed at how awesome they are to work with  Elizabeth Megan and Alicia all worked tirelessly to make our wedding memorable  The location couldnt have been better Im still getting compliments on how beautiful it was  We read the glowing reviews prior to booking and all I can say is that I agree with them 100
5,Awesome pool
1,Dont bother with this place  I had never been here my husband and I decided to pick up some food to take home  We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer an assorted tempura appetizer a lobster appetizer and yakisoba  When we got home the order was totally wrong Instead of lobster we were given mussels which were gross instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2 thats right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix  The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great pretty bland  I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw  Never going back such a complete disappointment
1,Ive eaten here twice and I dont think Ill ever eat here again I ordered the lettuce wraps and the food smelled like horrible BO It made me so nauseous I couldnt even eat it The salad is decent but I still cant get over that smell
5,"I think Mr Goodcents has the best subs in town  I have no idea why people go to Subway  Goodcents slices the meat and cheese when you order your sandwich and their bread is baked fresh  you cant beat it  Get oil and vinegar on your sandwich and the taste is to die for  

The staff was very friendly and oftentimes the owners are there working  5 footlongs are there too  only they taste 20xs better  Theyre all over the city if this one isnt in your neck of the woods"
5,I discovered this place by going on one of my usual 20 mile bike rides along the canal until something cool popped up I sat outside and sipped a nice chamomile tea as the first rain of winter fell unleashing an amazing scent The staff was top notch and I was delighted to see several tannat wines from Uruguay on the menu I cant wait to return some evening to share a bottle of wine and tapas with my girlfriend
5,Awesome staff Great prices Left feeling relaxed and refreshed A must try
1,"yuk service and food sucked never a
gain"
1,"I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night Though it seemed quite busy I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival Outside seating despite a hot Arizona summer was pretty nice with shade However this is where the pleasanties end

Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes No one bothered to offer us drinks and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers When our waiter came he did not even apologize for the wait and we gave our orders drinks appetizers and pita sandwiches

The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly only twenty minutes later Both were alright but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita We asked our waiter for extra pita and he kindly agreed The entire duration of dinner it never came

Refills were also a pain as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter and he wouldnt come until ten minutes later

An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches Ive been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour Half the tables outside already left including tables that arrived after us and we were the last ones served The food was of average quality and Ive been to better with cheaper prices

Slightly expensive I can see as justified But many agree that time is worth much more than money I had an excessive amount over an hour and a half wasted on a decellerating Sunday night Staff is kind of nice but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself arent immediately turned off I can say for certain that Im never coming here again and Ill find myself at better places much closer to home"
5,"I just went here for the first time a week ago visiting my parents who just moved to FH A

Great location view of the fountain outside seating nice decor inside really wonderful owner and a big menu of pastries croissant sandwiches Italian sodas and coffee

I had the egg salad sandwich the croissant and egg salad was SO FRESH with a side of potato salad was probably one of the top 3 potato salads Ive ever had

I also got an iced mocha which was just the way I like it on the sweet side

I had my 14 month old daughter with me so I also shared the potato salad with her and ordered a yogurt with granola  This was no ordinary McDonalds yogurt parfait  it was so delicious I had to have some too

One gripe that could be easily fixed by the owner  PLEASE BUY ONE HIGHCHAIR for your guests to use  We would love to come back often as we go see grandmagrandpa but I cant take another lunch with her on my lap"
1,"I hate to give this place 1 star but my recent experiences were horrible I use to dine at this restaurant often with my family The more we go service decreased Our water cups never get filled

The very last time I was there I found a gnat in my pho Although I have eaten about 50 of the medicore pho they asked if I wanted another bowl I said no I was there on my lunch break No time to wait for another bowl I got up to pay for my bill and to my surprise there was no discount or any sort of accommodation 

I am disappointed with them and will not be back"
5,We have been eating here for years I am as picky of a new yorker as they get with food I will say we do not eat there Monday or Tuesdays The cook must be different its not as good on those days The rest of the week is 5 stars all the wayGreat sesame chickenfried rice lo mien etc Highly suggest
5,There are a lot of places to visit on Mill Avenue    however there is no place like Fat Tuesday   When we visit Tempe we always make it a point to stop at Fats   We have always visited before the night time crowd comes  When we walk in the door the bartenders remember us suggest yummy drinks ask about us    treat us like we are special   We have struck up many conversations with other patrons who enjoy going to Fat Tuesdays as much as we do  During the day its a great place to just get out of the heat cool off with their daquiris and eat a delicious Po Boy  Jason is our favorite bartender    and we have lots of laughs with him   I am counting the days until weI will be back in AZ to go to Fat Tuesday
5,"When I was a dancer I always came here for everything Shoes leotards skirts and accessories They have every type of dance shoe and a wide variety of everything dancers need and want 

Im not sure how many dance shops are in the area but all of my instructors always recommended this place which is not very close to our studio The staff is all very kind and knowledgeable which trust me is a very good thing Dance shoes can get confusing There are at least three different kind of tap shoes 

Dees also has costume rentals so if you ever need a crazy costume at the last minute Dees can help you out with that too"
5,"Thank you Yelp I only wish i had six Stars Ok officially for anyone reading this pretend there are Six Freaking Stars This place is THAT good

I thank Yelp because the only way I found this place was searching for third wave coffee those who know what I mean by this will just know everyone else will just have to experience and forever after never drink Starbucks again while I was traveling in Tempe  

I dont like coffee I LOVE it insert Antono Ego voice from Ratatouillie movie here I literally have a coffee shrine in my house where I run a vintage Rancilio Z11 and pride myself on my espresso skills  Simply put I will never pull a shot like i had here  Off the chart awesome  

So thats the first 5 Starsthe Sixth star I just cant believe they have GOOD pastry too  I understand they produce inhouse and if thats true then its completely astounding  Easily the best croissant Ive had outside of Paris  Run dont walk to the Coffee Lab it is worth the flight to Tempe"
5,If you own a car that is older and you want it to look and smell new  this is the place  Our 3 year old truck looks brand spanking new after these guys got done with it  We also had them tint it and it turned out amazing  again  I say again because this is the second vehicle I have taken to them  That is the main reason I went back  I could not believe how good both my vehicles turned out  I had the window tint on the other one for about 3 years before I sold it and still to the day I sold it  the tint was perfect  They use only the top quality film and do quality work  I will keep going back and sing their praises all day long  If you are looking for a detail job or window tint this is the ONLY place you should be looking  Check out some pictures I took of my vehicles after they got done
5,"Im a complete dive bar junkie Whether Im in a big city or small town I always seek out the local spots I was in Tempe with work and we happened to drive into town right at last call so we searched for the closest bar which just happened to be Monkey Pants After we got over laughing at the name and the paint job on their truckwe went in and were greeted by the waitress right away It wasnt too busy especially for a Friday night but the place is huge The bartender was very attentive and adorable 

 I really wish I couldve made another stop at this bar before I went back homeI saw a bunch of posters for all these theme nights and great deals Reading previous reviews it sounds like they have parties going on like this all the time Great bar"
5,The perfect burger Awesome BBQ NEVER a bad meal
5,"Whyd the chicken cross the road
To get to Food Truck Fridays in Downtown Phoenix

I know that all you business Yelpers go out for lunch on Fridays its basically a rule if you sit in an office a cubicle or behind a desk somewhere from Monday through Friday dont believe me check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work Somewhere between how to comb your hair what you shouldnt wear and please dont come in smelling like Nair youll find it While Yelping about your Friday lunch is purely optional I certainly hope you do 

During your weekly 1 hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls ending up in the open air of Food Truck Friday will kick off your weekend right Its not just for Burger King people its time to get it your way 

Pick your favorite food from Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash or Mexican with Luncha Libre Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl to Pies with Mama Toledos and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness Bring your friends and your favorite gal they can choose their own favorite too Dont worry about bringing cash everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy

This is your lunch hour kick back and forget about work while youre here if only for 45 minutes Listen to the DJs spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food Chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters fans and swamp coolers bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90s 

This is your Downtown business Yelpers its time to kick off those business casuals and make Friday lunch your own"
5,"This place rocks  We bought 750 sq ft of tile a few months ago to install on our own and we had no idea what we were doing  They helped us every step of the way We made several visits over the course of about 3 months and everyone we talked to was helpful and knowledgable I will absolutely go back when we redo the floors in the rest of the house

And the prices are the best  I am a bargain shopper and will research prices for months before making a large purchase and that is exactly what I did when we embarked on this project  I researched prices all over online in stores with contractors etc and Floor and Decor by far had the best prices  The entire floor cost less than 1500 in tile materials and tools It looks beautiful and I couldnt be happier"
5,"How have I NOT reviewed Four Peaks yet

Awesome Even when its wall to wall packed Even after waiting in a 2 hour line for the special St Paddys day breakfast and festivities The beers are great the food is oh so good you really cant go wrong w anything that includes their beer bread And their breakfast If you can brave the crowd that comes out for it seriously do it One of the best breakfasts in town Ive had almost every item on their brunch menu and I cant think of one that disappointed

GO"
5,"i moved to the tempe area about 2 weeks ago from socal the mecca for asian restaurants  since moving out here my only taste for asian food has been panda express  well i was craving teriyaki last night but had no idea where to go so i did a search here  tokyo house got a bunch of great reviews and everyone mentioned a cool old man behind the counter so i just had to check this place out

as soon as i walked in the door i was greeted by the old manfrom across the joint behind the counter mind you  he was SUPER nice and SUPER funny  

checked out the menu and the selection was a bit overwhelming  they have every teriyaki dish available and bunch of fried rice and noodle choices and for those that like rabbit food vegetable dishes  i was a bit surprised though to not see gyoza or pot stickers on the menuwas bummed out about that

i had a hard time deciding what to get but remembered Sarah Ws review of the house chicken so i went with that  i went with a large order and let me tell you if youre hungry you definitely will be stuffed after a large order  the dish was very tasty and delicious and was definitely overflowing with mushroom  i love mushroom  the house chicken is supposed to be spicy and although it had a little kick it wasnt the spicy i was used to from asian joints in socal  i wish it had a bit more rice though  either way the dish was great  i would definitely order it again

i highly recommend this joint  you will be treated well by the cool old man behind the counter the place is clean the servings are generous and the  price is cheap"
5,As many other people have said in other reviews Betitos is similar to Filibertos  However I thought Betitos tasted a little better  The food was less greasy than Filibertos  My family had Carne asada burrito carnitas burrito a chicken chimichanga and the super nachos  They all tasted excellent  My favorite was the carnitas burrito  Now Betitos offers one dollar tacos on Mondays Tuesdays and Wednesdays  I havent tried their tacos yet but I intend to try them in the future
5,I eat here often and the lunch special is great  Food and service are equally good  Fries are to die for
5,great pho  boba  and vermicelli  awesome 
5,Their Alfredo the Dark is probably the best pasta dish in Phx And then theres the Pazookie
5,"Hiking Camelback Mountain has to have been the most difficult 1 12 mile hike Just up 3 miles total that I have ever been on While it is not a very far distance the increase in elevation is over 1000 feet in that short mile and a half 

The first thing that I recommend is either getting to Echo Park at bright and early between 430530 am or if you come later as I did just parking in the overflow parking You can find a simple map to the overflow parking at 

httpphoenixorgwpcontentuploads201004CamelbackMountainTrailheadOverflowParkingpng

The walk to the Echo Canyon trail head to the overflow parking is only about 2025 minutes and it is almost guaranteed to be faster than driving around looking for a parking spot somewhere else 

The trail itself takes about 20 minutes to actually get difficult but when it does decide to start getting hard it does not let up for a moment There are chain link fences at a couple of places in the hike to stop people from accidentally tumbling over very steep ledges and even handrails at times for more support up the trickiest sections of the hike 

The good and bad of this hike is how crowded it is There will rarely be a moment where you wont see someone coming or going for more that 50 yards at a time This means that while there is little to no quiet and privacy that if something were to happen to you there would be plenty of witnesses

The rest at the top is wonderful The view is by far the best in the valley and something that I recommend to everyone Take 20 minutes or so to eat a snack drink some water take a breather and take some breathtaking pictures from the summit The summit is usually pretty crowded so you wont want to stay too long 

Be careful on the way back It can be very tricky navigating some of the areas and twisted ankles and even broken legs are not terribly uncommon Again take you time and take plenty of breaks when you need them and you should be OK

Dont forget to take plenty of water I recommend at least a liter per person if you go in the morning and more that that if you do in when it is warmer outside"
5,When my youngest son graduated I took him to Buzz Boys when they were in the Food City complex He is now 25 and still goes I gave a family friend a gift certificate for Fathers day He still goes and so does his 30 yr old son My oldest son is out of the Army and he started going These men compare this to a spa for men Hot towels straight razor shave etc Hey I should get commission lol
1,"The worst Thai food Ive ever had This place was recommended to us by another couple and wow was I disappointed

Everything was completely blase and tasteless the only exception being the extreme spiciness of my fiances entreeprobably to make up for the lack of other spices

dont bother with this place"
1,Went there for a quick bite before the theater   Had the buffalo sloppy joes and they were disgustingdry buns thin sliced pickle  Then had the duck spring rollsalso bad   Then in an effort to eat something we could tolerate ordered the lettuce cups with shrimp and they were just adquate   Very disappointing
5,I have been here many times and have always had good food and service
5,"I heart Romes Pizza Being a native New Yorker I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza I had tried many local independent places but no one got it right 


When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road I figured we could try it out Im always on the look out for some yummy pizza Dont be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior after all isnt it whats inside that counts 


The food is always fresh The Greek salad is great  it comes in small and large The pizza is amazing as long as you know what youre getting  NY style I know that its family owned which I always have an appreciation for 


The man that owns it does most of the deliveries When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldnt find my street Embarrassingly I only knew the street I lived on and not much more so I couldnt help him He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house 
I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude thinking Im an idiot because I didnt know where I lived could you really blame him But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem How refreshing 

In a nutshell hoooorray for Romes"
5,"Joes Farm Grill features everything that is AllAmerican Burgers pizzas salads hot dogs and a variety of other classics each with their own twist I was pleasantly surprised that Sonoran Dogs were on the menu I rarely see them outside of Tucson I got a burger that was gigantic and yummydont forget to ask for grilled onions There are a number of novelties in each of Joes restaurants but my favorite part about this one is that it is nestled right next to farmland The ingredients here touted to be fresh and local and I could definitely taste the difference in my burger and especially in the fruit cup

I took my brother here for his birthday he got a 4B and looved it He wasnt able to complete the trifecta but there will always be next year"
1,After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service we left  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in Needles to say I will not be returning
5,Jakes been taking care of our cars for almost 7 years Hes very trustworthy and fair
5,"My new favorite place  I love this pizza  I became a vegetarian in March  So cheese pizza with mushrooms and olives is very important to me  And Mamma Mias is cheap and delicious my favorite combo  And my constant companion my 9 year old daughter born in Philly and a fan of hoagies loves their turkey subs  Im just in it for the pizza  

And if you sit outside you can watch the people going to the liquor store next door and watch the people playing frogger to get across the street to the Vig  Pretty good people watching"
1,I will never make another purchase from this company ever again The company tried to deliver damaged furniture to my home and then gave me the run around about processing a refund when I refused to accept the items After 5 phone conversations they agreed to refund me for refusing damaged items I cannot recommend this to anyone
5,SoI love Defalcos My bf and I are addicted to the Il Purista which is JUST PERFECTION with and without the prosciutto Ive had someone describe their service to me as New York style and I agree with that assessment so if you cant hang with it then go be a baby somewhere else The food is fresh delicious and incredible Their lattes are bomb and the cannolis pretty great too I dont have a single bad thing to say about these folks or their amazing food
5,"Just your typical warehouse club right  I guess that depends on your definition of typical  Sams club has hours just for buisness members starting at 700am  You can also fax in or go online and have them shop for you  All you do is go in a pay for it

They have a few membership levels Business Gold Member and Premium  The Premium level you earn 2 back on all your purchases  They do give you two cards for the price that you pay so you can go in with a neighbor and each get a card

In addition to electronics photo lab optical center bakery meat department they also have a little know clearance section at each Sams  You just have to know where it is  Also when they are clearancing out merchandise the price will end in a 1  Most common is 71 or 81  I have picked up 5 pound bags of mixed candy for 71 a bag and lots of other deals just by knowing this little secret

They do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves  They also will give cookies to children

My boys also love the cafe where they get their pizza and drink please  Their menu has changed  a lot lately though and I am not sure if I like it  Prices are very reasonable though

They also have gasoline pumps outside which if you know your prices can be a good thing

If you are not satified with your membership you can cancel at anytime and they will prorate your membership refund  Their refund policy is really good as well"
5,Ive done the Shabu Fondue more times than I can count  Usually I order a cheese fondu for myself and my main man gets a Shabu dish  They both apply the same concepts dip something fresh into something very hot and cook it yourself with long sticks  Mm  Ive tried all the cheese fondues and the Swiss is my favorite  That smell is unforgettable  Ive tried all the Shabu sauces too and theyre all pretty strong so they season those boring vegetables right up  The cocktail menu should not be overlooked  The caramel apple martini is the best  Now the chocolate fondue  Oh its so good  They serve it with marshmallows fruit and even a slice of cheesecake to dip in  For a very small price you can also add a shot of liquor  I personally always add a shot of Baileys to add some flavor  This is a PERFECT date restaurant and its not bad for groups either  The dcor is pretty rad too  The portions are healthy but it only works if you end the dinner with the chocolate
5,"Tempe Beach Park  such a gem in our landlocked State

Sure its a manmade water source and yes  its pretty nasty if you plan on swimming inside Tempe Town Lake but its gorgeous during the day and at night too

Ive done a handful of triathlons that started and ended at Tempe Beach Park and most recently I did the PetSmart Walk go team Yelp that took place at the park as well 

With the proximity of the park to ASU  Mill Ave it really is a fun place to go hang for an afternoon  no matter whats going on there

My only words of wisdom  dont swallow the lake water"
5,"This place is so unbelievably cool In a city desperate for arts this is perfect Her Secret is Patience is a bold statement for downtown a sign of youth renaissance and complexity Its serenity and overlooming stature make it something to admire I wish more public spaces in the Valley were this awesome 

Its worth checking out even if its not your taste in art youve got to admit its pretty interesting Be sure to see at at night too Lots of beautiful colors accent the homogenized office buildings "
5,"I resisted eating Zoyo for months after they opened because I was afraid Id get hooked and be there every day And yep its addictive They always have new flavors to try but right now my fave is salted caramel Its incredible I usually pass on toppings

As other have suggested itd be nice if they had smaller containers But I am impressed that they can keep the store so clean with the giant rollup doors open They lead to a nice patio thats sufficiently removed from the street that youre not just breathing exhaust"
5,"Finally a raw food cafe that isnt in Tempe  Love their drinks and raw food menu  Just wish their prices would come down bit    

This is the type of place I could eat at everyday  I know it is good because the afternoon lull doesnt happen to me when I eat here    

I do NOT go daily due to pricing but I would like too because I would simply live longer eating here  Your body buzzes with clean energy noncaffeine after eating here  

If you are a person who wants to be nice to your body  Splurge and give your body what it cravesEnzymes    

Who knew raw food was the answer to avoiding afternoon coffee"
5,Love this place food is very well portioned and yummy  I really love the endless selection of bottled drinks offered  Must try if your craving a soda different from the normal selections offered  But they do have the standby soda selections available as well  Stop in burgers have some crazy combinations to try
5,The best Pad Thai Ive ever tasted  Crab Wontons melt in your mouth Excellent service GO 
1,Was I there on a bad day or what  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold    They have 15 items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them   Gross and bland   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was Yuck
5,"being that im fully vietnamese and my mom has made all types vietnamese dishes ever since i was a kid i have quite the tastebuds for authentic vietnamese food also growing up in so cal there are a lot more restaurants to choose from 

for arizona this place is probably one of the best authentic vietnamese restaurants in town i always get their pho ap chaoeven the owner knows this when i step foot in the door  their pho is really greatthe broth is good the beef is good the noodles are good everything is like it should be their spring rolls are pretty decent what i really like is it doesnt pretend to be something its not its a hole in the wall place but most good and REAL vietnamese places are the food is great and the service is quick"
5,Barrio Cafe is an amazing Mexican restaurant  Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza travels to Mexico for many of her ingredients and you can tell  things are always fresh they only have an ice cream freezer creative and authentic  I am more than content w a mango margarita the incredible guacamole and the gooey caramel filled churros  Even when the restaurant is packed the staff is friendly and informative
5,I cant say enough good things about this place  I literally have never had a plate here I didnt like they also have a interesting and ever changing list of specials I usually order off the specials menu  This is definitely one of those places I could eat at every day  All that and I dont even drink beer my friends really like the beer here though
5,"After four years of living in AZ I finally found Mexican food that appeals to me and my husband Lets just say they changed my husbands view on tacos He never swayed from eating vegetarian burritos until he got a hold of their carne asada tacos In the last 4 months we lived in AZ we went there almost every week and brought friends whom now cant get enough of them too
They are reasonably priced have great customer service and everything we have eaten so far has been fabulous If you are looking for great food and youre not concerned with being in a fine dining Mexican restaurant then look no further 
We miss you Los Taquitos"
5,The Rusty Spur has the distinction of being the oldest cowboy bar in Arizona and a genuine registered historic landmark Its even got a hitchin post for yer horses out front The Spur has been patronized by the likes of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood  although never while Ive been there Theres great live music four afternoons and six nights a week Other good things include plenty of parking no cover and a fun venue to peoplewatch
1,veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front I made 12 uturns trying to find this place
5,"Tommy Vs is a delightful twist on old town dining where fine wines come with a surprisingly  refreshing price and food pairings  are always fresh and so delicious  The atmosphere matches the name  just oh so chic and the staff is always very gracious  We will return many times this summer with the new special app  entree deal too 

When I set out to go to happy hour last week I didnt expect Prince Edward Island Mussels and a most fantastic wine that our waiter recommended

Tommy Vs has the recipe for success in good cuisine wine and ambiance"
5,We love Niros The hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches are dynamite The Greek salad is big and fresh The gyros are also excellent Im a French fry junkie and these are my favorite in Phoenix Service is fast and prices are good The owners are almost always there and make us feel so welcome
1,Jimmy Johns is cheaper and better  The Capriotti food is heavy  and it doesnt taste as good as you think it should taste
5,"On my little trip around the city I drove over to Sweet Pea Very cute store and great personable staff

Nice selection to baked goods and great taste

What nice find in the downtown area Ive got Wicked Bakery up north and Sweet Pea downtown North and South is covered for those sudden cravings now time to find something on the on West and East sides of the city"
5,Great food as always  The owner is incredibly professional friendly and charismaticcame buy three times to check in on experience and even asked if we wanted more antipasto salad itemson an already generous wellpriced portion  The service is great  Homemade breads  Extremely generous portions  I would highly recommend this restaurant to all
5,Service is good The newer waitors tend to forget youre there Food is delicious never gotten food poisoning Cheesecake is magnificent The best kind is the Godiva expensive bit worth it
5,This is a great boutique in North Scottsdale  Ruby has such cute dresses to go out in and is a little jewel box inside of this shopping center  As the two other reviews said they carry great brands like the established Tibi or even new brands  One  that I saw and loved from Phoenix Fashion Week was Smoke  Mirrors Clothing from Los Angeles  Ruby carries a lot of what I saw and loved on the runway  Ruby is always getting new stuff in so its a great place to check in with anytime you need a dress or a kick start to your newest fashion routine Two thumbs up
5,"Im ashamed that I havent left a review for this place yet Ive eaten here for a good while and Ive never been disappointed with the food Well there was this one time but it was because it was sold out Im okay with that it tells me it was really popular that night Anyway

The prices are good the teas are good and its just fun to sit in the pews while watching the candles melt Every friend Ive brought here has had a good time with an equally good meal Im a sucker for the royale with cheese and a side of thousand island

You know what look at the average review score I really think thats the most telling part of this place Really Go Eat Enjoy"
5,Delightful experience I came in with my 2 little ones alone Jay was our waiter and a very good one He got the chefs to prepare their sunsine roll with orange and passionfruit dressing because I am highly allergic to mango He was very accomodating I also had the seared tuna tataki which was also excellent My kids had miso soup and their fried rice both were very good I was very surprised that a strip mall sushi joint would be thay delicious Thumbs up
5,This feels like a neighborhood bistro much like the ones I have visited in New York  The food is wonderful and the wine selection varies which I like  My favorite dishes include  Salmon crab crepe burger and ahi tartar  but their menu changes often so dont be surprised if you eat something you like and its not there next time
5,What can I sayMaharaja Palace was my midday getaway while living out in Phoenix and I miss it dearly  I visit as often as I can up to three times a year traveling from Hawaii and when I do I am always astounded by the flavors and array of choices this buffet provides  The tiki marsala happens to be my favorite dish and I find the staff to be accomodating and attentive especially when ensuring Ive got enough naan to sop up my plates delightful curries  I cant wait to return  This is THE SPOT for Indian Food in the PHX Metro Area hands down
5,"The family and I love this place as does anyone Ive taken there 

First time I went I had a cheeseburger pizza  huge and delicious 

Their beer is great too  brewed right on the spot 

My wife loved the fish tacos  it says a lot about a place that every time you go everything you try is fantastic 

Youll pay a little bit but its worth it"

5,Since I moved to AZ from Los Angeles I have been searching far and wide for a sushi place that met my high standards for great sushi Sakana is hands down the best in town The fish is fresh the rolls are huge and nothing beats the 50 cent appetizers when you buy a beer I recommend going on a weeknight Friday and Saturday nights can fill up pretty quickly so you might have to wait but its worth it
5,"Wow Wow Freakin Wow

I have never ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you learn your name cater to your every need and give you FABULOUS beautifully prepared food sincewell NEVER 

I must say I did do my research so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish

I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York She had been to Roys before and is a fellow foodie We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink Its December so a bit chilly but the HUGE soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had 20 martinis LOADED with vodka Warning We had to ask for more fruit juice And we are major drinkers  just gotta throw that in there Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine enjoying the late afternoon reading conversingwell if I HAD any rich or classy relatives that is It was very nice and relaxing Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did

When we meandered inside for dinner the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table She was very competent could make recommendations and was pleasant without being clingy We loved her She reminded me of Joan Cusack Sounded just like her

The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them

We shared the Roys Canoe for Two which had Lobster potstickers Beef Satay shrimp on a stick not its real name and Tuna Sushi Rolls I must say  the Lobster potstickers  better than sex The Beef satay was basically this ultratender beef on a stick lightly flavored and grilled Fabulous But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls which absolutely knocked our socks off I have never ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment I think our  server Joan Cusack Not her real name thought I was choking because as I ate it my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbsup sign For whatever reason these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine I relive that moment over and over MMM

But you know the showstopper was STILL yet to come I could not believe my luck when my Roys Trio was placed in front of me It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce a piece of Seared Ahi and a piece of salmon The poor salmon It was the best salmon I ever had out but next to those two it was like Cinderellas ugly stepsister Just upstaged by the butterfish which is meltinyour mouth decadence and the seared ahi  which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER

Amy got the butterfish We licked our plates clean Amy tried my Ahi and declared it like I did the BEST seared Ahi on the planet

For dessert you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle How good was it Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face

Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees  one had a Hawaiian orchid on it and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like I think the other flavors are vanilla bean very good too and maybe rum also very good 

It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when youve been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield which one is better They are both amazing but by the time Rick comes along well youre kind of spoiled already

Roys could not have been better  this entire experience was an A through and through 

The staff was extremely helpful someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxipads is out on the marble bathroom counter like party favors for down under

THUMBS WAY UP"
5,"I recently decided to accompany a couple friends on their quest to find the best sushi in Phoenix A few weeks ago we started here at Yasu Sushi Bistro While Im not as committed to the quest as they are I would be surprised if Yasu didnt rank among the top five sushi places in the Valley

We had an incredible dining experience at Yasu Our server was perfect she definitely knew sushi and had many great recommendations Im still somewhat of a sushi novice but you dont have to be a pro to know when youre eating a fresh creative meal

My recommendations start off with miso soup with clams and try the hamachi carpaccio At the end of the meal ask your server to have the chef make you something special He made us tempura avocado wrapped in eel topped with foie gras and served it to us personally It was amazing

Yasu provided one of the best dining experiences Ive had all year"
1,I just thought Id post an update  I planned never to go back but was with a friend who really wanted one of their breakfast items  I skipped ordering ANY food whatsoever and merely ordered coffee and watched her eat  As fate would have it she had a BACK HAIR in her scrambled eggs we are 2 for 2 now  My gag reflex is going off as I type this  My husband friends and I have renamed this place the Black Hair Diner and weve decided they have actual black bears cooking in the kitchen since they cant seem to keep black hairs out of their food
5,"My wife and I have a timeshare nearby and when we were doing a morning walk we saw this place and we asked our concierge she raved We went and fell in love with the place The service the food the friendship We go back every time we are in town and the staff remembers you Also my wife loves gnocchi and says that these are as good as her grandmothers

5,"We had a bad experience in May with a person at Charlestons we thought to be a manager see review  The next day my husband and brotherinlaw contacted the restaurant manager Chris we had great and immediate communication with him and he encouraged us to give the restaurant another try as we had been happy there before  
Recently we had a large party of family members dine at the restaurant and the service and food was perfect  Chris made a point to check in with us at the table and at the end of the meal  Great job Chris and team  We look forward to dining at Charlestons with you again soon"
1,I am a huge fan of Chipotle but I will never come back to this location The staff looks miserable and are SLOW The cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back Most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean The rice was crunchy like it wasnt cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy Never again
5,My home airport and one of the nicest terminals in the USA Great food cool things to see and do you just cant get bored here

5,"This is our DEFAULT happy hour
I wont be reviewing their dinner as I have never had an actual meal there

Im not really a beer drinker but they have such a big selection I always find something i like And Ive been told they have a martini specials but you dont go to a beer place and get martinis come on

Pretty much their entire appetizer selection which is what 20 items is on the half price happy hour menu You know what that means Four sliders and fries for FOUR dollars Also recommended Hawaiian Poke Stack

In summary I can wrap up Yard House in two words
Heck Yes"
5,Divine  the Carne Asada was so tasty  flavorful and tender  Everything we enjoyed tasted fresh and authentic The guacamole was knock you socks off traditional and limey I took my extra home and enjoyed the next day  I liked what the previous reviewer who said also that the beans and rice are not an afterthought here they are also amazingly well executed  I am eager to get back an try the Chicken and Barbacoa as well as the roasted green chile cheese dip   If your in the area of 44th Street and Thomas forgo the big chain of Chipotle and show this lovey Phoenix gem some love your taste buds will not be disappointed
1,"Worst slow service everespecially with almost no one in the place Food was average at best and thats being kind Skip it if you are looking to eat or get a drink

Just an update I as well as a friend who wrote a review of the day were contacted I didnt see my message until today oops and offered refunds and gift certificates Now this seems all well and fineI do appreciate them trying to make the most of the situationbut my friend is still waiting for a refund andor certificate So we shall see If I could take away my star for more nonservice then I would"

1,I took my kitty to the Beat the Heat low cost spay event and she came home with a hematoma in her ear that was NOT there when I took her there in the morning Surprise surprisethey can recommend a vet to take her to Im pretty mad about this
5,I am new to Jamba however i am surprised at the AMAZING customer service that this store dishes out One of the workers there has always noticed me as a regular customer He has a stellar personality gave me a 20 off card and sometimes has my order ready by the time i finish paying the cashier Hes always very bright and smiling or laughing with his coworkers I believe his name is Christian He suggested a banana oatmeal with peanut butter the other morning and i have to say that it has been the most incredible oatmeal i have ever had You must try this At times i visit the store twice a day simply because i cannot get enough Jamba Juice
5,"I stopped by here last night after the Suns game It was cheap and fast Also it was by far the best carne asada I have ever tasted It was tender and juicy and not at all rubbery I know the last time I had carne asada it was rubbery but that was also from a bertos joint I enjoyed the way this place is set up Walk up to the counter order and they bring you your food It is quick and efficient We got the dinner for 2 2 tacos 2 burritos chips and drinks for 20 The tacos were great as were the burros I will definitely be back 

Oh the 5 stars are specifically for the quick efficient service and the BEST carne asada around"
5,Great sports bar  Shows most UFC Boxing and WWE pay per views  Friendly staff good food  draft beer selection could be a little better but other than that one of my favorite local pubs

5,"If you are looking for a good vet you have to read this

If you are looking for a vet that is COMPETENT a vet that REALLY CARES about animals and a vet that is INEXPENSIVE and reasonably priced then you really have to check out Dr Howard at Grayhawk Animal Hospital in North Scottsdale He is worth the trip

I am so impressed by Dr Howard and his EXCEPTIONAL STAFF Every time we come here we leave satisfied beyond our expectations 

Since my last review we have used them two more times Once when Spencer got neutered and once when he had to have his nails trimmed I have to say I am so very impressed I was holding back on reviewing them again until I could be certain that it would be an accurate review and to be certain that they are consistent with their outstanding service and pricing Well I can say confidently now that they most certainly are

Spencer was neutered here some time ago with no complications and no outrageous fees When he was done his procedure I received a happy completely alert dog back from them His incision was minimal the sutures were tight and he healed quickly It was done so well that he did not even lick at the area It was like nothing ever happened

More recently Spencer needed his nails trimmed and because he was a rescued dog from a very abusive situation he does not trust people and has a phobia to anyone touching his tail or feet It is so bad that when I try to nicely calmly approach him to trim his nails he urinates all over himself and hides for the rest of the day Spencer was really abused and as a result grooming is really difficult

Well I discussed this with the doctors office and we decided that sedation unfortunately was our only option His nails were getting too long and painful and something needed to be done Well we just got him back from the office and they were so good about it that they did not even have to sedate him I am impressed but what I am more impressed with is that they first tried to trim his nails without using sedation and had his best interest in mind They really care about the animals they treat 

They could have sedated him It would have been quicker and easier and more profitable for them but they didnt They really did not want to use a drug on him if they did not have to  and so they didnt They trimmed his nails up well and did not even cut into the quick or make him bleed He left there again and as usual a happy well taken care of dog And we left there ecstatic The bill was so inexpensive and Spencer was taken care of so well  like he was their dog I just cant say enough good things about this Veterinary Office 

I think that everyone knows that good medical professionals are hard to find  for humans andor animals So often they just dont care about the patient Well not here It appears to be their top priority Dr Howard is a very happy well educated man and it shows in his practice in every way  right down to all of the people he hires they are all equally happy and competent You will not be disappointed if you go here They are honest and kind and not out to rip you off or get as much money from you as they can They are truly exceptional So if you need honest competent  friendly care at very affordable prices you owe it to yourself and your pet to make the trip over to see Dr Howard at Grayhawk animal hospital You will be in good hands You will save money and you wont be disappointed in the least

They are truly exceptional but that is the end result of really caring really liking your profession and really knowing what you are doing And we love them for it"

1,"I had such a nice experience here  Classic Chicken  the first time that I really wanted to go back Second time onion strings were so greasy I couldnt eat them burger was okay Third time yesterday Enough to say we wont go back Ever 

Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth he ordered 13 lb classic me the bbq grilled chicken  both with a small soda Soda was disgusting flat watery gross Upon the lovelys complaint the bus boy brought him bottled water I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair Gak We got up and left our food Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we didnt have a better experience Um A better experience Seriously 15 dollars 

Ugh"
5,Heather is awesome She did my initial set of lashes and Ive already gone back for a fill Her prices are great and she does beautiful work The compliments are rolling in Absolutely recommend
5,I love love Barrio Cafe The food is amazing and it is very cute and artsy
5,"Chino Bandido is a staple for my sister and I Im not going to lie when describing this place I feel the need to mention that while its not much to look at on the outsideinside it delivers some of my favorite guilty pleasures

I encourage anyone who is trying this place for the first time to take a few minutes and allow the staff to guide you thru what they have to offer With their complimentary taste test  you can try a few of their most popular dishes and learn how to order off of their moderately challenging menu but once you get it its super easy I ALWAYS go for the combination of double jade red chicken refried beans and plain fried rice

The snickerdoodle at the end is perfectly baked Every time Love this place"
5,"Im a pho snob my hitlist is impressive In Olympia I ate pho literally every single day Test me wannabe purists

Nam Sao is the best The guy always working and seeming to make the food is so quick and super sweet Great service my drink never goes empty and the table is set in traditional phojoint style a metal caddy with spoons forks  chopsticks napkins and all the delicious condiments

The menu is enormous so if you happen to be in the mood for something other than their glorious neverwatereddown noodle soup you can try something else The spring rolls I love them The boba tea is great too Ive had it thicker and more rich at Pho Hoa in Oly but I like the less creamy variety served at Nam Sao 

Fast service cheap filling meal wonderful server I literally cannot think of anything bad to say about Nam Sao except its so small its kind of hard to find if youre new to the spot Just go to the right of Frys and youll see this little piece of heaven with its lights on welcoming you in"
5,Great quality great prices If only they had longer hours delivery of large items and a gift registry itd be heaven
1,I usually do not write reviews but was so horrified by my experience I had to Went for a late night bite and drink with a friend they were fairly busy so we had a seat at the bar As I frequent The Moon often I was happy to see the bar was busy as well The bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had We ordered our drinks and watched as she broke glass into the ice knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle As we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face We decided to order some food as she spilled my drink on us refilled it with something completely different and she could barely even talk at this point We saw management watch her behavior and do nothing as she preceded to grab dirty glassware and refill it with beer I was so appauled by this we left befpre finishing our drinks or food Im not sure what she was on but if its visible to paying customers it should be visible to management Being beyond embarassed for the establishment I would doubt I will come back sad as we would frequent the Moon 23 times a week Horrible
1,"Most livable city my eye
Plastic yuppies around every corner looking for a reason to belong  I cant wait for the homosexuals to take control of this dog park and give it some class

Avoid at all cost"
1,This place is awful  I bring my fourteen year old daughter along for services once in awhile and on two occasions here they managed to seat me and skip her for other clients that did not have appointments  They wont accept a tip from your debitcredit card which is pretty inconvenient if you dont carry cash  They use a cheap base coat in an unmarked bottle that leaves my polish job looking funky My mother was a loyal client until she got an infection in her toe after a visit  I dont like to write bad reviews but this place does not deserve your business
5,Cholla Trail is a lot of fun and moderate hike Echo Canyone is a lot of fun but also more challenging Overall both trails are so much fun and a great workout
5,All I can say is yum
1,"Im a little shocked how high this place is rated to be honest  Im not disappointed easily but Ive given this place three chances to impress and theyve consistently disappointed   I live nearby and was very excited for a new trendy place to eat  drink The first time we went there we sat at the outside bar The male bartender was not personable at allhe was actually quite rude When I politely asked him if he knew the price of a liquor off the top of his head and not to worry about it if he didnt I was just curious he snottily replied with well theres not a button for it so I dont know He then rolled his eyes and walked away I was astounded at how rude he was but shrugged it off I actually felt bad because I thought somehow I offended or embarrassed him because he didnt know the price of this particular liquor so I apologized to him and he proceeded to made another smart comment about how he charged me the well price but that the next time I come in it might be much higher again being very snotty and rude My boyfriend was actually pretty upset at the way he spoke to me but chose to let it go because we just arent the type if people to be confrontational or to complain  After our meal and about an hour before close he told us he was leaving and that another girl would be taking care of us When she showed up all she did was clean the bar in preparation to close even though that wasnt for another hour and didnt even introduce herself or say hello I waited for her to notice that my boyfriends Blue Moon was empty but she was too busy cleaning so I asked her myself She asked me what beer he was drinking I told her then watched her pour the wrong beer and give it to me as if I wouldnt notice Not all alcohol is available at that side of the bar For instance Blue Moon and the liquor I was drinking are stored at the main bar another point of annoyance for the original rude male bartender But how is that my fault I didnt know that  And clearly this girl didnt feel like going to the other bar to pour the correct beer for my boyfriend even though she specifically asked me which beer he was drinking and then lazily poured whatever wheat beer they had in tap at the bar we were sitting at That was the straw that broke the camels back for me We paid out and went to Darcy McGees in the same shopping center where the staff are always pleasant and helpful

We have since given the Lion two more tries but been severely disappointed with the service The food is excellent but just cannot make up for the terrible service The second time we tried this place we sat at the main bar as to not inconvenience the bartender at the outside bar and all of the bartenders were too busy talking amongst themselves to notice that both of us were empty on drinks and hungry with no menus offered to us Im sorry to say that we wont be giving this place another shot"
1,The worse food and service I have never given a bad review I ordered a shrimp dish with brown rice The waiter brought out white rice The sauce was horrible and bland The calamari salad was not fresh The dressing was bland too The waitress checked on us and we asked for check immediately  She never asked if anything was wrong or if the food was good I would never recommend or eat here again The service and food was horrible I was visiting from out of town and was hoping to get a new experience  This was not it
5,Excellent pizza great service family environment in a beautiful setting  That sounds like a tagline on a website but its legit  The diavola and the salsiccia are my faves  Just amazingly tasty simple pizza with quality ingredients made the right way in a brick oven  Pizzeria Bianco might have em by an inch just based on pizza alone but if you dont want to wait 25 hours for a pie Cibo is the place to be and almost as good  And although Bianco has a 25 hour wait whereupon i generally drink wine for the durationwhich might be part of the reason the pie is so good the limoncello at Cibo generally floors me just as well in a quarter of the time
5,"The quintessential Brewery with a wholly fantastic kitchen Best spinach artichoke dip in the valley period From fried to gourmet Four Peaks has it all Beerbread sandwiches are always excellent fish and chips bavarian pretzels french fries daily specials I really havent had an item that I didnt like The weather is perfect right now for a sunny patio lunch or fresh air dinner 

Lets not forget the beer My favorites are the Oatmeal Stout or the Peach Their peach beer is legendary with low sweetness and a crisp refreshing taste If you think cider is too sweet but like fruity flavor this is your beer The oatmeal stout is thick and hearty with no bitterness Seasonal beers abound pumpkin porter in the fall Ive seen an orange blossom belgian white barleywine etc

Parking close can be a challenge on weekend nights best to ride your bike if youre close enough

Just go there already"
5,"A small bite goes a long way I first was introduced to these brownies in 09 when I received a variety box with 12 sprites and a can of cocoa for Christmas I love the packaging  the deep purple and brown on the box and wrapper After devouring my first brownie I was an instant fan The card in the box said you can freeze the brownies for up to a month but it was gone within the week The can of cocoa lasted for a good 3 months I used it for baking  cookies breads cakes etc 

My faves Cream Cheese Espresso Nib Toffee Crunch and Caramel 
The sprites are just the perfect size because its just enough to get your chocolate fix but not overwhelming I just throw one in my purse before I leave the house and I can have it with my coffee in the afternoon 

Im a subscriber of their email so Ive been receiving emails with discount codes and free shipping Its so hard to resist Lucky me I stumbled on a Groupon several months ago and I got a box of 24 Sprite for almost half the price plus shipping"
1,I was going to take the time to write a scathing review but I honestly cant even bring myself to do it 1 star Thats all I can say
5,Excellent staff Always knows how to make my drinks Always remembers my orders every time I come in too
5,"Vintage sodas sold by bottle all of your grandmothers favorite childhood candy an abundance of gag gifts and novelty items you just cant dislike this place Each time Im in I spend a good hour just perusing the countless Fred  Friends products and debating whether or not I should buy the stickonmustaches or 10 of the Chinese finger traps 

But lets be honest here I mostly go for the photo booth By far the best photo booth in town good quality pictures not cheap like the ones inside the mall and they have little masks glasses and mustachesonastick you can use in case youre tired of flashing the peace sign or making that horrendous duck face

Soda Candy Toys Photo booth Dont kid yourself Youre never too old for that ish"
1,I will never go here again So disappointed when I went in its a cute store dont get me wrong I would buy so much there for my dog But the day I went I went to get a treat for my dog for his birthday The lady was on her phone the whole time talking personal business while my mother and I stood theyre waiting for her to get off or put the person on hold All we wanted to do was to ask her to get that dog cookie for us So after 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave and while walking out the door the lady shouted thanks for coming That pissed me off cause she put down the phone to say bye but not to get an actual freaking sale Ill continue going to to petsmart Tried to support a local business but I guess when you own your own place you can have poor customer service
5,Brown bag chicken sammich mac n cheese fried okra and the bourbon drink  Nuff said
5,"A few weeks ago I was receiving quotes to have my AC unit replaced due to the hail storm we had back in October I had few companies come out but no one and I mean no one was as thorough as Dale with Mason Mechanical was He spent 90 mins going over everything including climbing in the attic to check things out He explained the differences between different units as well as what he and his team could do which included taking out my furnace and installing a new acheat unit pricing etc

Fast forward 3 weeks later and I was able to get the appt set up to have my unit installed Crystal set up everything for me  and she was fabulous especially since I had to cancel the first time around due to my work schedule Thank you for your patience Crystal Mike the tech who was in charge of installing the new system called me promptly at 7am to let me know he was on his way and would be at my house within 30 mins Fast forward 10 hours later and my new unit is installed He explained everything to me including how to work my new programmable thermostat made sure everything was in working order sealed off the area in my now new closet where the furnace was made sure everything was cleaned up and was just all around great I am very happy that it was nice mild day here today because I dont know how they can do this in the summer

Thank you to the entire team at Mason Mechanical"
5,"A friend of a friend was telling us about this place on Sunday morning and how awesome their pizza is  It sounded awesome but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long  Oh well we went anyway  Luckily we were early enough where we didnt have to wait long for a table  When we were leaving though the line was easily an hour long

We started with the wings which come in an order of 14 and were delicious  Five of us were dining there so we ordered two small pizzas with each one being a half so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from  We got the BBQ Chicken the Frisco Grandma Gs and one more that eludes me now  All were pretty delicious and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings Grandma Gs had potato on it  Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under 80

Oh make sure you sit outside the inside had a lot of loud kids and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party  The women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there  Keep in mind too that they dont have a full bar so if youre going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary youre out of luck"
1,Horrible service Barely acknowledged when you first walked in Slow service and waited for my check for 20 minutes before getting up to go get it myself Will not come again
5,I recently had sunscreens installed in my entire  home by CC Sunscreensi did research and found CC had the best pricesCarl the owner was amazinghe came to measure the day after i called  He answered all of our questions  He gave us a great price and in less than a week the screens were professionally installed  The screens are not only of the highest quality  they look great and make our home look brand new  We noticed an immediate difference in the coolness of each room    and we look forward to saving on our energy bill too  We cant thank CC Sunscreens enough    They are simply the best
5,"Finally a Japanese owned sushi bar beside Sakana in Ahwatukee  I guess Sushi Ken has been here for a while but I didnt realize what a great find it was  

My wife and I went there to splurge on Japanese sushi since they are better than the typical Korean owned sushi places which are most common in the Phoenix area  

We found we didnt splurge at all as we do at Sakana or Hiro  We didnt break 30 which surprised me  5 stars for value and great sushi

Domo Arigato"
5,This is not a fancy place  Its address is on Scottsdale Road but its easier to get to from Shea about a block east of Scottsdale  Its split into two sections  As you walk in if you head to the left there is a bar with a couple of pool tables  I cant really say that Ive spent any time in that section  We head to the right where there is a central bar with booths along the walls  If you are into Karoake this is a great place to go  The DJ has a great voice and many of the usuals do as well of course there are quite a few who dont but thats to be expected  Weve been here dozens of times and never not had a good time  Its casual and very reasonably priced  The food is way above average for this casual of a bar  The shrimp are spiced to perfection and the chili is to die for
5,I needed new tires  2 months later my husband Both experiences the staff went out of their way to either get it done on time or make it work price wise I have always used them for my tire needs and we travel for jobs so we need them a lot
5,The oatmeal cookie frozen yogurt here is amazing  The place is small but accomodating enough to get your yogurt and find a seat  Its similar to Yogurtini and the other places like this  Last time I came here I saw a guy with the most awesome 80s blonde mullet I have ever laid eyes on Rock on
5,My wife and I moved from Seattle in November of 2006 We thought we would find great modern Mexican food all around the Valley Fortunately we found it but only at Barrio Cafe so far Barrio Cafe is a sure hit with anyone who loves Mexican food without a half plate of gray canned refried beans Their menu is excellent thought put into the dishes inspired and the ingredients are fresh Its well worth the hour wait
5,"Downright awesome and extremely hip A nontraditional very out there but very hidden coffee joint

You cant see this place from the street Its kind of behind the Buffalo Exchange Its almost the last place you would expect to find a coffee shop As soon as you walk in there are really bright and vivid paintings this is kind of what makes it way out there Barista was very friendly and asked us how the weather was always cool to have some small talk instead of the drone what can i get for you Wait that basically sounds like the boring coffeegrinders at Starbucks

I gotta have my lattes I will drink regular coffee sometimes but my soft spot is a well made latte Amazing enough places like Starbucks just dont know how to make lattes I give up on Starbucks Their beans suck and apparently their frothing machines do too because everytime I go there it seems like they just warm my milk and mix it with some coffee The latte here was PERFECT The milk was perfectly frothy which in my opinion is what makes a latte a latte Coffee had a nice roasted flavor to it Amazingly there are tons of coffee shops out there that cant do decent lattes This is my new coffee place

Good music choice here its like new age elevator music calm soothing hip hop and pop Awesome atmosphere quiet enough to study and have a conversation yet lively enough to come for just a cup of caffeine Skip the Starbucks and Sex in the City sorority girl drinks and come here

Only problem was that I think they only have small or large lattes and it was like 4 for a large Thats like 050 to a 1 too much in my honest opinion Oh well I think Id still pay that when Im craving a latte"
1,"I learned of this company through a living social deal I emailed them to set up an appointment The earliest available date was a month later I went ahead and scheduled the appointment in spite of the wait time One month went by  on the scheduled day of cleaning in which I was told they would arrive between 12 and 1 NO ONE shows up I wait at 330 I email asking why was this scheduled appointment not kept Ive yet to get a response or an explanation

There are many cleaning companies out there my suggestion  try a different one than Maid 4 it all"
5,I was at The Rhythm Room and saw these cool people selling Tacos so I checked it out It turned out to effen awesome Fresh quality food  ChiChi lisous Be on the look out for these guys Chow down baby
1,"I was there on a Friday night with a few friends in the hopes of a quick drink and nosh after a show next door
My companion and I ordered basic drinks and were met with shots of liquor in the bottoms of our glasses and a blank look from the waitress when I asked if they were out of mixers  After this we opted not to order any food taking our cue from the inability to mix gin with tonic water and were met with an outrageous bill for our two well shots  We questioned the tally and were met with a second total that wasnt much better  
Our credit card was charged twice 40 for some wet ice and a lemon wedge  There are many cool and artsy places in Phx where we can catch live music and nosh with friends  Ill pass this one up from now on"
5,"Caught Louis CK here last night 

Beautiful theater absolutely stunning It was clean the staff was really nice and parking was a breeze The sound was great the seats were comfy and I cant really find anything to complain about Truly one of the most gorgeous theaters Ive seen  down to every detail  its my new favorite I love it 

LOVE

If you twisted my arm and forced me to complain  well in the lobby where they were serving drinks the line got a little excessive It wasnt so bad really  but I tried both of the wine they were selling and I kinda hated them This is more of a bit of advice for you to booze it up before you get there than it is a complaint I cant recommend this place enough"
5,"Andrea has been a lifesaver literally She was watching over our furry monsters when our AC went out  in July and we were across the country She not only made an extra visit just to see if the AC was broken but helped us find an open kennel to get our cats boarded Shes been our creature sitter several times now thankfully with less craziness

Her rates are very reasonable and she keeps in great contact with you Her initial visit with us went over all the little things we wanted done like picking up the paper and bringing it in and was very thorough Since she offers a full house sitter and pet sitter menu of services shes knows things to cover that we had not thought of Shes very professional and is licensed and insured 

Your animals will thank you"
5,I had the terrible decision to make to euthanize my 20 year old cat Bandit I was going to go to the Emergency Animal Clinic off of Scottsdale Rd further north but I had previously had a bad experience there I saw there were some good reviews for this Emergency Animal Hospital and thank God I did They were so kind and compassionate They let us take our time never rushed us They knew it was a very painful thing to have to do They made one of the worst things I have ever had to do as easy as they possibly could have They eased my nagging doubts about it without putting words in my mouth I am ever grateful for their kindness on that incredibly sad day and would recommend them to anyone who has an animal friend who needs some emergency care
5,"I love this Gelato My favorite combination is the panna cotta with the mint chocolate chip Weird but wonderful I am rarely down this way especially since Ive moved but I still fantasize about digging in to this deliciousness  

I only ever had great service and fantastic product here So far it is the best Gelato Ive had although I hear Arlecchinos is pretty fantastic as well I miss visiting Angel Sweet I will have to go back soon"
5,"I love PizzaAMetro and so does Joe Arpaio I am quite certain it is the only thing we have in common

This is where I take my foodie friends because they are usually so busy eating they shut up for a while I kid I kid I have never had anything here that I dont find super delicious and craveworthy The first time I went here my party was personally doted on by Maurizio who was overthetop gracious and seemed to truly love what he was doing  While I dont see him every time I am here the service never suffers

The calamari is crisp and light which is a nice change from heavy fried calamari that is so ubiquitous in too many Italian joints Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Frescolina The combination of the arugula and prosciutto makes my mouth water even thinking about it

So next time you are at PizzaAMetro my advice is dont loudly discuss if the portly man next to you is Joe Arpaio Dont look him up on your Blackberry and pass the photo around to get the opinion of your fellow diners Dont bring up that his mother died in childbirth and how that potentially explains a great deal of the mans politics No matter how much wine you have had do not forget how small this restaurant is Because in the end after he and his bodyguards leave the server will tell you Yeah That was him"
5,Great Kobe on flatbread and the skirt steak is fantastic Waiters are very attentive and helpful Ive eaten here twice in the days conference and I would go back Their menu is diverse enough to try something new again
5,NOW WERE TALKIN Killer Mexican Food The chips n salsa kicks ass You get a red blue  regular tortilla chips with reg spicy salsa  bean dip Hellava start A kickbutt margarita Had Chicken FajitasTHE BEST Cannot wait to return Great ambiance
5,"Great selection of vitamins and supplements good prices and I can get the special treats our cat likes while Im picking up the goods for myself Plus their rewards program is pretty straightforward

I also like that they are not all over you like the other local chain is when you walk in the door 

I highly recommend the Vitamin Shoppe on Camelback"
5,"Went here for a work function today What can I say this place is awesome A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet yum

Nice salad bar with good variety as well instead of bacon bits they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon

Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries mmm

Simply awesome stuff Taking the wife when I can"
5,"Im not going to lie  I indulged in fantasies about Howard Roark during the course of my 90minute Insights tour His spirit and convictions were brought to life by FLW and being in this incredible complex where he lived worked and taught was indescribably cool  The tour takes you around the property and through many of the rooms restored to various periods of Franks life I was a bit dismayed at the disrepair some of the rooms are in so I spent money in the gift shop hoping it will go to repairing some sad looking chairs and windowpanes  
Overall the tour guides are genius at describing and making you feel like youre seeing things through FLWs eyes with his vision on architecture and lifestyle  This is not to be missed"
1,Donuts are worst Ive ever had I bought 2 dozen donuts using their 1099 sale and it was the worst donuts I have ever had in my life All the donuts were dry and stale I should have gone a couple of miles over and bought Krispy Kreme Krispy Kreme donuts are always fresh These ones were worst that those that sat on the shelf for a week in a supermarket
5,This is the best Cajun place in Arizona The portions are great and the people behind the counter are really nice I love gumbo and I have tried several kinds here and all of them were excellent Yes the decor isnt 5 stars but seriously if youre more worried about mood lighting and soft cushions you can go to Pappadeauxs and get charged an arm and a leg for lower quality food the drive and the price are definitely worth it for this place
5,"The Rosson House Museum is a restored home from the 1895s  And its also conveniently right next to the Teeter House Tea Room and across from Pizzeria Bianco  

For under 5 you can take a guided tour of Rosson House and learn what life was like for its residents so long ago Its a really cool activity to do and since its close to so many great restaurants you can go for dinner and drinks after your tour 

Walking through the home its easy to imagine the lady of the house sipping tea in a dainty cup with her lacy gloves on 
Or maybe its just me 

Houses like this tend to creep me out I halfexpected to see a ghostly woman in a pinafore around every corner but let me tell you Im glad I didnt 

Either way coming to Heritage Square and exploring the historic buildings in it is a great way to spend an afternoon"
5,Dr Dairiki is terrific She is professional listens to you and explains things so that you know exactly what she is talking about I have never had to wait and the other thing I like is that she calls you back personally to let you know test results or if you have questions plus it is done in a timely fashion
5,These dentists are great at explaining medical issues in a way that you can understand They are honest and very smart They dont take my insurance and I still go there lets face it dental insurance doesnt reimburse much so its only like a 15 difference for me to go out of network for a cleaning I would never go anywhere else
5,I have been coming here since 1996 and the food just keeps on getting better   The jerk fried rice and emerald chicken are to die for and he snicker doodle cookiesoh my goodness   Every time Im in phoenix this is my must go see do eat spot  The owner Frank is awesome
5,I will have to disagree with many of the previous writers here  I have been to Michael Minna in San Francisco which is way more famous and crowded but this one is better  Lets begin with something that impressed me  When my partner and I sat down someone came over and immediately handed her a black cloth napkin  Sounds simple but its nice when you have nice black pants on and dont want white crap all over them  Second the food was great  The duck fries were really good and free I had a great corn chowder with cilantro and a small grilled cheese sandwich which was perfect I never eat those My main course was a skirt steak in a fantastic sauce  My dessert was beignets and creme brulee  The beignets were great and the creme brulee was good  My gf makes it much betterwe each had two drinks a pear martini which was excellent and an even better white cosmo  All in all the food was tasty and the appearance of the place was nice and swanky  Its about time Scottsdale started opening restaurants that can compete with SF and NY
5,Our server Amanda was awesome with her suggestions and service Would go here again in a heart beat
1,"Is it illegal to have good Chinese good in Arizona  We went tonight having high hopes of having high quality fresh Chinese food and we were sorely disappointed

We opened our take out bag and the white rice had been left off of the orderwe were going to give them a pass for thatbut on the flavor issuethere are no excuses

The Peeking Dumplings were wilted and flavorless  The sauce that went with them could not revive them  The Chinese mustard was in little packets and had no heatViagra needed

The Mongolian Beef was so salty it tasted processed

The snap peas were stringy and overcooked

The General Chows Chickenit tasted old like it was off an all you can eat buffet

HonestlyPanda Express is betteras least you know what to expect in a mall food court

It wasnt cheapand Im not a food volume person but the portions were smallI was fine with it because who would want more of this plate of shame

I hope they can get there act togetherbut I fear the owner may be in over his head

Isnt there a Chinese Chef in town who needs  a job"
5,This QT is one of my favorite locations It is always very clean and the staff is upbeat
5,The hula burger was awesome Great service The hostess is very kind and sweet What a great find
5,"Found this place through Yelp and a Yelping buddy so there you have itthe power of Yelp because we absolutely LOVED this place  Tucked into a neighborhood you have a very cozy eclectic little joint  From the start to the end we received extremely friendly service We of course tried the foods suggested in previous reviews and by the server  The pasta fries were unique light and paired with great tasting sauces  A definite dish you have to try  We also tried the figs stuffed with chorizo  Also very good  savory  But the ABSOLUTE FAVORITE of the night were the chicken and waffles  My gosh is this the dish to come to the Tuck Shop for  The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside  The waffles were served with a butter that seemed to be whipped with possibly honey and the syrup was just the right sweet  All the flavors seemed to work with just the right amount of sweet and savory  The grilled fresh green beans were the perfect side  I think I would get this dish over and over and over again  Then I would go back and get it again  
Great place we will frequent often  

PS They make their own tonic  Yep their own tonic  GREAT tasting  Try it with the vodka they serve havent heard of it before but was very pleased"
5,"Loved this place since it open but they have changed their menu up a little and it seems they have cut corners and products out of there repartee  The sandwich I got this weekend was very bland and somewhat disappointing in portion size Ive grown accustom to at the WBC and theyve discontinued making their bread salad Very disappointing  I will be back but with fewer expectations I guess

I received an apology letter from the founder and an offer to refund my money  I dont need a refund this is not what Yelp is about but it was really refreshing to know that a company still cares about their customers reviews  After re reading my review it may have sounded worse than my experience actually was  The sandwich I got was a new one from their menu named the Spicy Chipotle Egg Sandwich it was good but I like SPICY  I may order it again and just ask for an extra egg and some more chipotle sauce  The gentleman did give me the recipe for the salad that Ive enjoyed in the past   

This type of service is what makes a customer for life"
1,"There are few resources in Arizona for dancers actors and performers so its best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping Dees Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town their customer service and return policies have suffered
In an emergency situation youre better suited going to Mischas Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezios in Scottsdale Otherwise order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible"

5,Every item that I tried was amazing Owner made it a pleasant environment and he had a terrific voice A must try in Central Phoenix
5,While visiting Arizona we were told we must try Macayos The margaritas fruit flavored and blended were a bit on the sweet side to the extent that I was worried I might get a tooth ache The prices here are very reasonable I had the fajita quesadilla delicious I cant stop thinking about it The service was friendly and somewhat efficient This isnt a place you go for decor and ambiance but they do have outside seating always a plus in my book
5,Oh how I miss this Goodwill store which opened in September 2011 I moved to North Carolina in March 2012 and have not been able to find anything like it here Large clean and very well organized this store is thrift shop heaven And its all for a good cause theres a job center right on site that helps people find work Go on Thursdays if you can when a designated tag color is just 1 Ive purchased a lot of name brand clothing here for 1 per piece You can also check out certain Saturdays when everything in the store is half price I got a great mirror that matched the dresser in my guest bedroom for 1250 This place is so good I would not be writing this review if I still lived in Arizona because I would want to keep all the bargains to myself
5,"So freaking good  The drinks are great too  Ask for the icon not on menu but very good

Love everything I had there  Service is great and food is absolutely delicious  Wish I lived closer"
5,"Chipotle is my go to place when I feel like picking up a quick meal and this happens to be my local one

Always busy and youll almost always see someone you know getting some delicious Chipotle as well

Portions are huge but no complaining because its all delicious"
5,"I remember when this was Frysback in the 70s I think its great when these older buildings are put to good use instead of being torn down for another new strip mall What a perfect place for an Antique Mall

This is a store that you could spend hours and hours really looking at everything This Antique Mall has TONS of GREAT Antique findslike REAL antique and retro STUFF not recent overpriced crap that most Antique Dealers throw in their booth and try to pass off as something worth a lot of money There are things here that I havent ever seen at other Antique stores before

I quickly walked down the aisles the prices seemed pretty good and yet some that seemed OVERPRICED I wonder if Antique Dealers are wanting to sell merchandise or pay monthly rent to store their museum Believe it or not you can still get BETTER deals on ebay

Several of the booths seemed like they had a theme like stepping back into that time era they were merchandised nicely

The restroom even looked like some grandmothers tacky bathroom decor it really fit in well with the antique feeling

I will definitely come back here when I have more time to shop

1,"This review is based solely on service  not the food 

I am sitting in a booth at RA as I type this  that is how upset I am with the host staff at ra I called ahead to inform the restaurant that we would have a party of 8 When we arrived the girls at the front were so rude I almost walked out We waited 35 min for our table and the entire time the host staff was looking my entire group up and down giving us the stink eye I am sorry that you are 18 years old work for 8 and have a stick up your butt but do not make us feel unwelcome My girlfriend and I went to the back to use the bathroom  the host followed us back and asked us what we were doing  not to help us find the bathroom but just to be a snob From here on out ra is ruined for me"
5,One of the best restaurant in town I have been there few times and they really manage to wow me every time  The owner if nice and friendly and is really on top of things The service is great and the food is amazing  We are going again this Saturday and I cant wait to taste their New Years eve menu Happy New year 
5,"Was in a few weeks ago and had the white bean chicken chili superfantasticdeliciousness  ive only had one meal out of about 20 here that i didnt like  Wildflower is one of our favorite afternoon places to grab a bite
Thanks Louis"
5,hamburgessa heaven  Guac and bacon on a burger is ingenious  I do wish they had some curly fries or something but the burgers cant be beat  Also the condiment BAR is brilliant
5,"FILLYBs  only 8 reviews NINE now

wow do i miss THIS place

 24hrs
 drivethru or walk up only
 ridiculously cheap
 ridiculously tasty

of course the arizona burritos are good everything is good i used to LOVE one of the combos you get a beef burrito taco rice and beans for UNDER 6  wow  color me silly and call me sally they have bomb horchata too

really good and fresh flautasrolled tacos and breakfast burritos damn everything here is good whether drunk or sober"
5,Definitely one of the best barbers on the westside of town Ely takes his time and makes sure you are satisfied I have tried a few different barbers around town and this is the best spot by far I recommend this spot if youre looking for a great and friendly barber
5,"If you havent been to this place  go Seriously Its amazing Its the best little holeinarundownstripmall you can find And its cheap

Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting this tiny place is hidden in the corner The owner is from El Salvador so dont expect it to be Mexican food  there are many similarities but the dishes themselves are different
Walking in you can smell the homemade pupusas  seriously it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America Its amazing There are only a couple waitresses and I dont think they speak much English but the menu is in pictures as well as in Spanish and some English so you should do just fine

Get the pupusas  theyre like thick handmade tortillas stuffed with either pork cheese and beans or my favorite cheese and loraco flower which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus to me Its definitely the best one These things come with salsa and some coleslaw if they dont just ask for the salsa and are very filling
The other dishes are really good too For a low price you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans  and this place doesnt skimp on the fixins They put slices of fresh tomatoes avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates
I honestly LOVE it here If you want to avoid the crowds come at an offhour then you can just sit relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner For dessert pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register
I cant recommend this place enough"
5,Honey jalapeño chicken lollipops and sweet potato tots are probably some of the most delicious things ever
1,I have never been treated so rudely in a retail establishment ever I went to the shop with my daughter her friend and my nieceall young adults I showed a picture of the project we wanted make to the woman working there and she scoffed at me  I noticed she was playing Solitaire on her iPadapparently we interrupted her game She then proceeded to tell us that she would have to open the door and turn on the air conditioner because her mother the owner of the store would be back soon and is extremely allergic to fragrance  The girls and I had body lotion on this is the desert for crying out loud and not one of us had perfume on  Then the mother arrived there was a brief conversation behind the curtain and she walk out with a towel over her mouth and nose commenting on having to open the door Seriously Unfortunately we had picked out some stuff to buy and Im sorry that I spent the 68 I could have spent more but the experience was so distasteful that we hurried out If I knew how to give less than 1 star I would It was unbelievable I empathize with the woman and her allergies but the situation could have been handled so much better
1,"I dont think anyone who gave over a 2 has ever eaten Italian food in Chicago 

I struggled to give 2 stars but figured the wings were decent 

1 No celery salt on the Dog
2 No cucumber on the Dog
3 WORST OF ALL the GYRO was not off a spit it was processed
4 Also living 30 years in Chicago I have never had a gyro covered in more lettuce than there were onioins 
5 Since when does a Gyro not in Chicago have Feta Cheese  almost not Tatziki
6 The PIZZA IS NOT CHICAGO STYLE ITS 100 New York
7 Wings are a 6 out of 10
8 THERE IS NO DEEP DISH PIZZA OFFERED OR THICK CRUST
9 I apologize they have now gone from 2 to 1 star 

PLEASE CHANGE YOUR NAME YOURE A DISGRACE TO CHICAGO

Dont think I will give this place another shot no reason"
5,I am in love with this place Everything is delicious I have been in a few times now and hands down the best thing there is the asian mushroom soup The portion size is perfect for lunch They offer a sampling of 3 soups with bread which is perfect since I cant ever make up my mind Last time was in Janet was serving roasted red pepper and sausage frittatas and bacon and egg soup both of which were excellent
5,"I booked our anniversary trip to the Westin Kierland through Priceline  It was so reasonably priced that I was a bit concerned it would lack quality and after reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor I was worried  I was COMPLETELY wrong  This is a 5 star resort from the moment you park your car  The front desk staff upgraded our room and this very nice gentleman greeted us with a smile every single time we passed through the lobby  They have golf carts available to drive you to your rental car  The food in Deseo is amazing  I would definitely recommend trying the ceviche sampler and the muddled cocktails  I cant forget to mention the amazing bread made with tapioca flour they will even give you the recipe 

We especially enjoyed talking to the girls in the information center the one that looks like a mine  They were VERY helpful in giving us advice on local restaurants and insisting we take a day trip to Sedonawe did and Sedona is now one of our favorite cities Thanks to Ashley Miranda Tiffany Chelsea and Pat  When we returned from our Sedona day trip we had chips  salsa and two cold coronas  This was a very thoughtful touch

If you are looking for a fine dining experience Mastros Ocean Club is right across the street and has incredible food  I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and the seared scallops  

Back to the resortour room had a great view of the golf course which was massive  Although we are not golfers we certainly enjoyed the view  Our room was a pretty good size and the Heavenly Beds are my absolute favorite  When traveling I will do my very best to ensure we stay at a Westin Resort"
5,"I see a lot of four starsperhaps Im too generous with my five stars Im a giver

Attended a party for Georgie on Friday night and had a great time 
Easy to find easy to park easy to get a drink 

Plus HEY they have the same turbo nozzle ac vents that I have in my home I could live there Exposed brick Me too Felt right at home
I love the way they display their art Im assuming from local artists 

I would prefer to not have to walk down a flight of stairs after a night of drinking However no problems there  thankfully "
5,"i dont say too many prayers
saint or sinner i dont care
which is worse which is better
corinthians apostles letters
dont read the bible preach the word
no born again but i have heard
of saintly acts around this town
the volunteers each morning bound
unselfishly they give their time
a day an hour  can remind
you how sometimes the way things go
to count your blessings never know
hungry homeless most are blessed
St Marys cares for all the rest
feeding famished forty years
donations come from far and near
warehoused sorted then sent out
deserving families who no doubt
would otherwise just not be fed
but gratefully they go to bed 
with bellies full and filled with hope
thanks to St Marys most can cope
with unemployment cost of gas
mounting bills and dwindling cash
humbly they come take what they need
a box or two enough to feed 
their families ease their malaise
for weeks or just a couple days
so volunteer you wont regret
its what you give not what you get    
easy to say you could or should
but doing good will do you good
we just showed up put us to work
boxes of apples stand and sort
with kids from SARRC autistic all
httpwwwautismcenterorgdefaultaspx
joked and laughed sacked and hauled
bags and boxes  we gotter dun
side by side some old some young
so be a saint they need your help
then write and post reviews on yelp
that maybe someone else might read
and too will help good folks in need"
5,Love this store  Were really helpful when I helped plan a replica white house dinner for DESERT SHADOWS MIDDLE SCHOOL for 370 7th graders  Gave me a discount on the party supplies I purchased for the event  Even called others stores to find me the extra stuff they didnt have  Love their halloween section too  Its my one stop shop for parties
1,Let me preface this review I have lived in this area for 15 years and Chompies has been the only option for good Jewish deli In my 51 years I have never received worse service than from Chompies They ALWAYS get the order wrong Tonight after much debate I caved for my daughter who has strep throat She wanted nothing else but matzah ball soup to make her feel better So reluctantly I called in for take out at Chompies I assumed the one thing on there menu that might be a safe bet and hard to screw up would be the soup I returned home and called my daughter in to tell her I got what the doctor ordered As I watched her pour it in the bowl we noticed it was missing one key ingredient THE SOUP  When I decided to call and tell Chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order This was more than screwing up a order This was forgetting the soup in SOUP They told me if I wanted the broth I should have asked for it in a separate container I responded I didnt think I had to ask for broth in soup I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM A DIME OF MY MONEY AGAIN  I highly recommend to drive the additional 1520 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food You will be highly disappointed with Chompies This is the first time I have ever heard of yelp My son told me to come on here because this is a way to tell other people to avoid restaurants such as these I hope you take my advice
5,"Warning dont get deterred that there arent any seats for you when you walk in thats a good sign that the the tables are full with everyone stuffing their faces  I waited for about 15 minutes for a table to free up and Im glad I did  It was kind of a chilly night and I was feeling for something hot  I decided on the seafood noodle soup and pork pies  The noodles soup broth was lightly seasoned with a hint of white pepper just the way I like it the noodles were thick and hearty and the portion was substantial  The pork pies 3 were like a flattened pot sticker that had been panfried on both sides Yum

Definitely a place serving up genuine Chinese food with the finesse of a homecooked meal I cant wait to go back"
5,I chose this place because of the 100 rating on urbanspooncom  the proximity to the hotel my family was staying at We were absolutely blown away Dont let the location of a strip mall deter you from this place The food is absolutely perfect I had the bouillabaisse while my 2 table mates had steak Each dish was prepared perfectly The service was also some of the best service we have ever had at any restaurant The waitress was so attentive  detail oriented I never had to ask for anything she always knew exactly what I needed My water  iced tea was never below halfway At the end of the meal the ownerchef came out to greet us  that was such a nice gesture We were so happy to compliment him  his restaurant My visiting family even said that they would gladly come back to this place on their next visit This place is so great  you just need to go visit it
5,Mojos was my favorite till I tried Menchiesmuch better flavors like Chocolate Covered Banana and even Pumpkin awesome for their seasonal  Lots of flavor very rich clean  priced at about what they charge at mojosmaybe a little more but Im not sure
5,Went here before a Phx Suns game DELICIOUS Everything on the menu looked amazing I forgot what it was called but the openfaced steak sandwich was my favorite All the dishes were even presented nicely Will definitely eat here again
5,i love love love the high level of customer service that paul and his staff provide at central car care  i recommend them to all my friends  good service nice people great prices reliable  what more can you ask for
5,"Only 10 min away from walking distant
This is really really really good also really really really bad

I am almost finished with trying each soynami So far and not a fan of the one with banana
YET EVERYTHING is just just good Place on top of a Swiss Alp let me sing dance and exclaiming goodness oozing 

Also i can eat one and not feel lik I am creating havoc for my metabolism to compensate

RL

NOTE Oddly takes an unusually amount of time to get into my hands 10min
Worth the wait worth the walk worth the extra chocolate "
5,Great restaurant  I had the brisket sandwich and loved it  They bring out fresh cornbread before the meal which is a bonus and small little donuts for after the meal  The restaurant has a great decor and is a very pleasant atmosphere If you want some good ol fashion barbecue try this place out you wont be let down
5,Sushi is not just a meal its an experienceEverything from the way fish looks to the crisp green of the seaweed is art  The smell of the sake and the sound of crisp sizzle on the grill create an environment conducive to stretching the palette  Yasus does this like no other sushi placeThe fish is pristine the rice like air and the flavors intense and varied  My wife and I live a stones throw from this place you would never see it if you didnt know it was there  Its like a little secret that is starting to get outAll I can say is that it is hands down the BEST sushi in Phoenix period  Get the fried oyster rolls get the grilled mackerel or troutjust try it

I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of Daddy Long Legs ATCs first musical production at The Herberger Theater tonight  The twoactor Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock musical plus the invisible but great assets the orchestra and sound crew entertained and amazed me w their execution of a wellwritten body of work  It had comedy romance deception and sorrow to name a few whats not to like  Truly enjoyed McGinnis impeccable timing as well  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees and I cannot fault them whats easier to bear 37 per person plus 3 parking fee which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show or 10 and free parking at the movies well at least when youre NOT catching one in downtown PHX  However when you do decide to place the financial investment you will almost always be rewarded w a highlymemorable night believe you me  

I had a wonderful time and I would definitely recommend Daddy Long Legs to anyone who enjoys great acting and music  Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies I cherished them"
5,Id go back the next time Im in town  Its friendly in here  My friends and I just went in here to peek but we were presented in glasses of rose  It was good so I checked their stores of champagne I like it pink  I should have bought a bottle but we were on our way to an interview or dinner
5,"Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top Be very careful its easy to loose the trail on that side too 
Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend Parking can be bad at peak times on weekendsI definetely recommend late afternoon hiking less exhaustion from heat less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top 
Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians"
5,Very friendly staff or a fast food place their customer service and friendliness is unmatched I go more often than not simply because of the experience every time Thanks Micky
5,"Love massages and facials

I would highly recommend Enrique for a massage  Great technique  Great membership prices and great walkin schedule for those last minute needs"
5,"This place is so unique I was disappointed that it was closed the weekend of my birthday in July but I wont hold that against them

This barboxing ringvintage storefood trucksoda fountain is super awesome My cousin took me here a few years ago and since then its been a place that I always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown The drink list is pretty extensive with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars You definitely get a good sized drink The beers are cheap the food is soso I think its a bit overpriced so Id recommend eating somewhere else beforehand 

The boxing ring is random but Ive seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor and that is a sight Ill never regret seeing Some nights they have karaoke which Ive chosen to partake in a few times Ive seen DJs there on the weekends and I really like how they switch up the music genre each time Sometimes its rap others rockabilly and oldies On Tuesday nights they do FREE swing dancing lessons and Ive been really wanting to try that

i love the vintage feel to the place and am surprised its not packed all the time"
5,Havent been here since 1997 Man now all the memories are back and cant wait to get situated in AZ for a couple days 
5,"Why would I go to a restaurant and hope for the worst  Because Im a snob and as a snob I was convinced that The Capital Grille would fall short of my extremely high expectations  Not so

Bread basket Outstanding onion bread a pumpernickelgolden raisin bread and some crisp cracker bread  Nice all around

Extensive wines by the bottle with some great values to be had  I did not check by the glass  Our wine was decanted artfully at our table and the staff had a ready knowledge of the vineyard and year we had selected

Husband had

Oysters   Blue point tonight small this time of year so no big surprise there well prepared and delicious

Lamb chop  Perfectly flavored and cooked Frenched the definition of how to prepare and cook a lamb chop perfectly

Potato Au Gratin  Typical steakhouse Au gratin  Excellent flavor huge portion guaranteed to please a crowd or anyone that loves a delicious cheesy crusted potato

I had

Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella  You cant imagine how good this isa lovely thin slice of prosciutto cooked to crisp perfection wrapped around a fresh piece of mozzarella cheese with just the right amount of melt but not escaping the prosciutto shell  A parmesan toast and tomato salad round this out  You might as well as shaved gold on the side

Sliced filet  Im not going to go into detail just know that the answer is YES Is it fantastic Is it cooked to perfection Is the flavor wonderful Is it a great cut

Asparagus with Hollendaise  Awesome stuff  Nice to have a great hollendaise that I didnt have to prepare

Service  Our server was so outstanding Im going to contact the manager at this location

Atmosphere  We had a corner table that gave us great privacy  We could not hear our neighbors"
1,"Brought a group to Metro for brunch made the reservation a month ago called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldnt accommodate 

Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic Not enough menus slow horrible drinks no silverware soup was burnthow do you burn soup Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us 

I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro 

They have recently changed management unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation dont hold true anymore

Update 1182010
Since my first review I received a 50 gift certificate from the management of Metro  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends  I knew I couldnt just go with one other person it had to be a group to show what they could do  

We arrived at 915 and were seated on the patio  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough I never saw her again  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full

Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly  it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu

We ordered beignets apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all

Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section"
1,"4 stars for the place itself and its foodcoffee
0 stars for the service or lack there of  My business partner and I were in town for a convention  We heard we should check out Lola  So we did  We were excited  The lady I use the term loosely here who took our order was LESS than patient OR helpful  We asked a few questions  She barely answered us then when we had to repeat the question she was nothing short of annoyed  An example  We asked where we could get a glass or cup of water  She mumbled something about the bartable  My partner walked over and saw no cups  She came back and asked where the cups were  On the table came an exasperated retort  I walked over to inspect for myself  There were no cups on the table  So I kindly asked her if the cups should be on the table if so there appeared to be none  She said they are on the table but sigh Ill go check but I know theyre there  10 seconds later she comes out of the kitchen with a tube of cups  IMAGINE THAT the customer was right  I watched this lady serve other customers  It appears that regulars are treated with a smile and courtesy and patience  Newcomers or people she doesnt like are treated worse than the dirt on the bottom of her shoes

My suggestion to management adjust her attitude or get rid of her  She is not good for business"
5,"Came here with a bunch of the crew from work during lunch and wow This hidden gem on the corner of Indian School  48th Street is a must visit if youre in the Arcadia area The food here is amazing and theres such a wide variety including delicious tater tots even sweet potato tater tots and the mouth watering reuben that I had chosen You get a good sized portion as well Thank goodness for takehome boxes 

The restaurant is very spacious and the staff is really friendly  laid back but get you seated and eating your food in no time It gets better the price of the food is VERY reasonable in fact Im kind of shocked how inexpensive they are A well deserved five stars"
5,First time eating Chicken and waffles and it was the best time ever
1,I never knew green chilies were more valuable than gold We ordered a dozen red tamales and a dozen green chilies The person taking our order was not happy that we did not give them a 24 hour notice that their gourmet tamales require for such a large order The red tamales were as dry as sawdust and the green chilies came with one small sliver of chili The hot Sauce they have is nothing more than enchilada sauce with red chili flake added Next time Ill just go to Del Taco where two dozen 40 cent tacos do not require a 24 hr notice from a family of 6
5,I went to cowboy ciao for my birthday and was very pleased with it My family typically likes to get a bunch of stuff and share so we started with a chopped salad the shrimp appetizer and the mushroom appetizer The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were really flavorful and delicious however the chopped salad was the star of the night It was so good I ended up ordering another one because the first one was devoured so fast I typically dont think of salads as memorable dishes but this is by far the best salad I have ever had and I would come back just for the chopped salad To finish it all off the server brought me a huge piece of delicious chocolate cake on a plate that said happy birthday which was a nice touch I would definitely recommend this restaurant  great atmosphere and even better food
5,Love it here Come regularly now lol thanks to everyone on yelp Great food cheap price great service Tho not 100 percent authentic Chinese food still great
5,"Absolutely beautiful grounds Golf course restaurants shops botanical gardens tennis courtsits all beautiful Definitely book a room here as opposed to the main section of the hotel  Im not exactly sure what the difference is but it IS a different and smaller building

Our room itself was nice but the view was what made it amazing From the balcony you can see the golf course the mountain desert views cactuseverything And the service was great

The only complaint is that when I booked my stay I was told that each guest would be assigned an Ambassador who would help ensure a great stay or whatever But throughout my weekend this supposed Ambassador was never mentioned and didnt show up Not a big deal but if youre going to promise that service then you better deliver

Otherwise great stay I would highly recommend this hotel Great for a relaxing weekend"
5,"What  a beautiful facility Attention to detail is what this place is about and the army of workers each takes his  her portion of the details and does a mighty fine job If you want a high end place to stay This is a good choice When I made my hotwire reservation and ended up here I got the deal of the century I am sure the rack rate is high but if you want comfort and great facility this would be a wonderful choice 
Oh yes Everyone and I mean everyone was soooo nice The gardeners  the cleaning staff the front desk the parking attendant all of them were super nice and fun and genuinely happy to be of service"
5,"I moved to AZ about five months ago and have had two tragically bad haircuts from two other salons 

I wear my hair in a short pixie cut and its very hard to find someone with the skills to do it right so I dont  end up with a mans cut

I found Epic Salon here on Yelp and decided to give it a try

I could not be more pleased  My appointment yesterday was with Chey and shes wonderful 

I am very exacting when it comes to how I like my hair cut and am fluent in industry terms so I can articulate what I want

Chey listened very well and understood what I wanted She totally delivered 

I am so very relieved to have found her  And at 26 cut only no blow out its a real deal"
5,"I do love rum and should review the Rum Bar separately but both the Rum Bar and the Breadfruit restaurant are equally awesome 

Great recommendations from the waiter Brown Stew Chicken and Jerk Chicken are really good really spicy on the jerk chicken but thats somewhat expected and perfect for me Ill take my plantains baked over fried any day SO GOOD Really great place to go for not so typical food 

The entire place is quite small in a perfect intimate way  Their seems to be a lot of pride in the menu environment and service which is rare to see in restaurant employees Not to mention a perfect location  very walkable to other nearby bars and easy to make a whole night of downtown phoenix"
1,"Worst store in the chain  I agree with one poster that its not crowded but it also is out of items more than any other store  It also is so understaffed its impossible to get help if you need it and if you ask someone that works here that you finally locate my experience is that they wont know what your asking for anyway  I recently was in the store asking about a certain item by Susan Lenart Kazmer the person looked right at me and said oh we dont carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but Susans line is a Michaels only item  I gave the woman the line name and said no we dont carry that Im sure  I pointed at the huge display in front of me of Susan items and her answer Oh that must be brand new  I said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we cant do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen   Ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right  so I go up to pay a pleasant young girl asks me if I have a Michaels card  I say sure do and hand it to her  Oh thats not a Michaels card ours are red  I explain that its a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist Im there quite a bit  She says Ive never heard of that before  Well its a Michaels card just read the front it says Michaels right there  she stands looking at me so I said try scanning it I promise it will work  She scans it and then says oh it says you have a 5  off coupon loaded on this card  My response  good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend  Now she looks scared and says the dreaded words Im not sure  let me call the manager  So 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the Susan Lenart items  They finally agree to try it and Im finally out the door just 40 minutes later  And thats not even the bad part   I went into this store to have something framed that was three weeks ago they tell me every day it will be the next day all to no avail they use every excuse imaginable custom frames take time or custom mat colors are hard to get   Each time I explain its a off the shelf frame there only cutting a black mat  they say oh that should be fast will have it tomorrow  

I wouldnt shop here again if it was all free this store is a joke just keep driving and go to the large store at Power and McKellips its a much larger store with competent staff and about twice the selection   Its well worth the drive and the cost of gas I live less than two miles from the gateway store and can still drive make my purchases and drive home much faster than trying to shop at the local gateway store  They have even  framed two other items while Im still waiting for the Gateway store to cut a simple mat"
5,"This is a small location but still packed with everything I need  They did start stalking more womens vitamins I liked without iron because they were always out when I went in  So I thank them for that

Staff are always nice and for the most part an answer all of my questions  They take an added effort to get to know their customers  They always ask about my son when I go in and this keeps me coming back because I feel valued as a person not just a customer"
1,"Bleh

Most of us have ventured to the rock at some point in time It has always been quite awful but I had some hope after new ownership took over and renovated the place It is always sad to see a place that has potential be complete crap

Upon walking in we were greeted by a small room used as a bar area with random bar tables along the side And whales And scary looking people And a DJwellkindahe was playing music from a computeryou knowlike you would so at home

We ordered two beers and sat down Why not give it a chance right Just when we thought that things couldnt get worse we heard a sound Like a squealing sound Yes you guess right horrible karaoke ON A FRIDAY NIGHT Why God why

We chugged our beers and left"
5,From the moment I walked into the lobby the staff displayed a level of professionalism that you dont get to see everyday Each staff member that I came into contact with gave me a handshake and said Welcome to our business I dont normally enjoy going to the dentist but this has been the complete opposite They made me feel very comfortable and confident that I was going to be happy with my experience and I was  So I set up an appointment for my 9 year old son on the way out Since then we have both been in to have work done My son need one filling and he took it very well then trotted off to school like nothing ever happened I started with a deep cleaning from Bobbie Lynn Tucker  RDH  She was very nice and personable did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth not to mention gentle I was never in any pain either during or after the procedure  My following visit was with Dr Brittian DDS  I needed a few fillings and I am very pleased with his work Again gentle and quick  My teeth look beautiful and feel wonderful They were great with explaining all the costs and have cool perks like a Rewards Program  I also liked the glass back wall that gives the patient a private calm view of the outdoors The flat screens are cool too but my only complaint is that when I asked quite seriously if they could change the channel  I dislike sport shows a lot they were not going to budge That might be something they want to work out Other than that I really would recommend  them to everyone
5,Ive been to this Pita Jungle a few times about 34 and ordered carryout once Every single time my experience was great Great service great food and great atmosphere Ive ate at the patio once during a rare cold winter night and the waiter without us even asking put a heater right next to us It was really nice and kept us warm while we ate our food At times it gets busy but the wait has never been too long and annoying This place is great and compared to other Pita Jungles Ive been to the one on Shea Tempe and Downtown Phoenix this Pita Jungle has to be the best The ambiance is nice and the decor is very welcoming A big open room for the dinning space works well
5,"Picazzos is a freaking miracle for gluten allergies  

Almost everything there is gluten free and you can get something besides gluten free pizza  I highly recommend going during happy hour and just eating the starters  meatball sliders are awesome

Pizza is very good as well  More reasonably priced than a lot of the chain places that get their really friggin expensive dough from somewhere else  

People with celiacs  rejoice  Picazzos is legendary"
5,"Yes she did go to anotherits a hobby what can I say

By far this is the LARGEST club Ive been in But my list of places to visit is still very long so there may be bigger I liked it here the girls and managers and this is important to me were chill and nice Some variation in looks for the girls but not much but then again maybe there is more to select from at night Im a day club visitor because I hate to pay cover and other unnecessary costs This place has a nice size bar and a freaking huge main stage with three yes count them three twostory tall poles And some of the girls climb all the way to the top And it doesnt end there there was a more private but large room toward the back with another stage and tall pole Theres an upstairs to this place too I like to wander I have a curious sense of adventure I found multiple smaller private rooms up there along with small mirrored rooms with single chairs You know for that kind of oneonone that no ones all up in your business about kind of room just you and the dancerThen there is the balcony that wraps around the upper floor plenty of seating with DJ in the center spinning whatever the ladies on stage ask for this is rare some DJs will tell you to take a flying leap if you demand a song so Ive been told This place is lit well too not enough to make you run out screaming of blindness but good enough to see 

May I add that this is the first time I didnt have to go through a dressing room full of halfnaked women to get to the restroom it was separate and had more than one toilet in it yes amazing I know Ive been won over lets see the other places on my list top this"
5,"Absolutely adorable

This place made our 5 yep you heard it here5 hour wait much more enjoyable  I think it we had to sit in the same building as the pizzas were being made and had to smell the delicious aroma of others pizzas for 5 hours I may have gone nuts  Bar Bianco was relaxed and had everything anyone could ask for while waiting for your meal  We loved the Arizona wine and enjoyed a tasty plate of cheese and meat while lounging in the cozy chairs in the corner  

Not only is this bar a great waiting room before Pizzeria Bianco but I would consider coming here just to relax and have a drink

Cheers"
5,I think I may be addicted to this place This location is a  bit out of my way but after a terrible experience at the Superstition Springs Buffalo Wild Wings this became my goto place All of the servers are incredibly nice and efficient and my order always comes exactly as I ordered Ive been here twice during the 2011 Stanley Cup finals and was happy that they had the sound on loud enough in the bar but not too loud that you had to shout to the other people at the table The food is consistently perfect the atmosphere is great and all of the employees I have encountered are friendly The drink specials arent too bad either You cant go wrong
5,AZ 88 is a great date location  The atmosphere is excellent  always an artistic display usually great music  If my parents ever make it out here from Wisconsin Im definitely taking them to AZ 88  The view of the Scottsdale mall is really cool and the proximity to a number of the old Old Town bars is really convenient  The food is reasonably priced with most sandwiches and dishes right around 10  They have a good sized bar selection with some really interesting imported beers  I would absolutely recommend the AZ 88 sandwich if you enjoy buffalo sauce and its really hard for me to not order the little crackers with onions and bacon on them even despite disliking bacon
5,The best Chinese food I have had since leavong Chinatown in California  The crab puffs had crab not Krab and were much more crab than puff  The food was cooked perfectly and delicious  I strongly recommend the Mu Shu Pork
5,Four Peaks baby  This spot is awesome  Great place to meet up with a crowd grub and pound some craft brew  The food is great dope appetizers  rockin burgers decent pizza and daily specials  The beer is fantastic hop knot being my fave  They have happy hour everday from 37 and 10close with dollar off beers a light night menu TVs and a pool table  Ive gotten mashed here more than a few times  Sunday brunch is killer and may I suggest you try the Stout milkshake a little known secret but good for the sweet toof  Dont miss out on the Peaks
5,"My boyfriend and I decided to try Boulders out last night because we wanted some good beer and its within walking distance of my condo Good choice on our behalf 

We arrived around 1030 pm so we took advantage of reverse happy hour 1 off most pints on draft They were also having half price pizza night but we had already eaten pizza earlier in the evening so we did not get a chance to try the pizza Had we been hungry it seemed like a great deal

I was VERY impressed by their beer list They had the biggest beer selection Ive seen anywhere When I was shopping at a specialty store last week I noticed a Maui Brewing Co Coconut Porter that l was very curious to try  but I passed it up because it was 10 for a 4pack ouch I asked the bartender at Boulders Rob if they happened to have that specific beer  and to my utter surprise they did I was happy I was able to try it out before shelling out ten bucks to buy a four pack at the store Two thumbs up 

Speaking of Rob the bartender he was great Very fast to take care of all the customers around us as well as my boyfriend and I Made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive 

Overall I had a really good first experience at Boulders on Broadway and I will definitely be back I dug the oldschool ambiance with the wood paneled bar we received very good service and the selection of beer was amazing  truly something for everyone 

If you live in the area Id recommend checking it out
I plan to get some friends together and go back for one of their team trivia nights soon  sounds like a blast"
5,awesome and delicious place good for groups
5,"I am so grateful to say I have had the famous Rocket Burger  This place gets so much Yelp praise and for great reason  

The soda selection is off the hook every soda you grew up with and then some all in coolers in bottles the even got YooHoo

Fries are all natural cut and amazing there is just something great about fries with the skin on them they just taste better 

The burger was Phenomenal I had the Santa Fe which had the amazing Rocket Sauce bacon and fried green chili  It was outta this world good  

I will be a loyal customer and I am sure will post numerous updates to this review cause this place is just that good"
5,Its my fav starbuck cuz its across the street form my house It taunts me daily Pavlovian response make my mouth water for a white mocha nonfat no whip everytime The people who work there remember the regulars and offer suggestions and even help you save money by working the angles to get you the combination special price  Also a good place for people watching or picking up a little something on the way to the light rail or antiquing up 7th Ave
5,"We went to this place for my birthday wanting to try out something new Wed never had Ethiopian food and we were very adventurous Be warned we had a GPS and we had a very hard time finding it its tucked away in a little corner

Once we found it and stepped inside we were definitely wowd The waiter answered our questions about the food and suggested that if we really want the Ethiopian experience to try out the Strictly Vegan combo We ordered Tikil Gomen Misir Watt Kik Misir Watt Gomen Watt Shuro Watt and the Dubba We fell in love with the Shuro and the Misir Watt The Shuro is chickpeas in a cinnamonspicy sauce and the Misir is spiced lentils Soooo tasty Even nonvegetarians will enjoy this place and they do have meat dishes"
1,Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed My 8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest Ive ever had Service was slow the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived and staff was unapologetic Ive had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch Overall a miserable experience and I wont be back
5,"In short  Jen rocks

Finding someone I trust to watch my crazy crew is always a bit nervewracking  I came across Jens Pet Sitting while searching for options since Im relatively new to the area  

I decided to book a consultation with Jen to have her meet the furry family and learn more about her and her services  Jen is extremely professional and came ready to take notes and also spent a lot of time getting to know my critters  It was clear from her interactions with my cats and dogs that she loves animals and really understands them  

After having a great experience with Jen during the consult I booked her to do visits over a long weekend  The hubs and I took our dogs along for the trip and Jen looked after our cats while we were away She gave us regular daily updates about our cats while we were gone  Sometimes she sent pictures with her updates which was an added bonus  Jen spent time playing with our cats during each visit which was fabulous

I always know Ive found a wonderful petsitter when I come home and my animals are a little disappointed to see me  We will definitely continue to use Jen in the future"
5,"The best Vietnamese I have ever had Very authentic menu not even in English Great service and knowledgeable staff The ambiance is lackluster but this is typical with Vietnamese food 

Great for dining in quickly or taking home"
5,I have been to slippery pig a half a dozen times in the last few months since moving in nearby I have nothing but great things to say about the shop They are friendly and courteous and I havent experienced any of that bike snobbery that comes with LBS I am glad I found a local shop with great service
5,"Awesome place

I am pretty sure that this is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale 
Honeycomb radishes and a huge heap of rainbow valley butter for an appetizer what Whaat I had to take a picture of it The waitress gave me a hard time about this but she was cool p

My coworkers and I went on a mission to try everything here I do remember the brussel sprouts being too salty but everything else was great spicy broccoli
fatfat cooked potatoes
perfectly grilled ribeeyeeeee yummm

but i dooo remember the brussel sprouts being a bit too salty for me but i forgave them for this 

In addition to the great food its a cute little restaurant with a lot of character The servers who are also your bartenders  i thought this was a bit interesting are really friendly 

Good memories here"
5,"My first and only experience there was excellent The service was exemplary  the server knew the menu was enthusiastic about it and assisted us in choosing our items without being pushy The food was exceptionally prepared and tasted excellent The tzatziki was the best Ive had Nice and thick with cucumber and spiced well with herbs and garlic The spanikopita was also exceptionally with fresh clean tasting spinach and delicately textured phyllo dough The pan fried calamari reminded me of Europe fresh tasting delicately fried in olive oil and not in the least bit chewy The pita bread was warm and fresh and for dessert the baklava had a complex flavor and tasted home made 

The environment was tasteful old world European and exceptionally clean and organized I will be back"
5,"I love this place  I especially love it on Tuesdays when its free 

I have been to many lectures openings and films at the Museum and am always fascinated  

The changing photography exhibit is always fantastic  The fashion room is one of my favorite features  BUT my favorite piece is the firefly installation  I could seriously live in that room I take everyone I know and everyone is always as mesmerized as I am and I have seen it many times

I love the new contemporary wing of the museum  I also love the glass boxes on the sides of the building  One time we were there during a thunderstorm and sat in the glass box and watched the lightening  It was perfect  

The museum always makes me happy"
1,"Slowest DRIVE THRU ever Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location

I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 1015 min ordeal When i worked at Mickey Ds in the early 90s we had what was called 90 sec HBO Hand Bag Out from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs This must not be a practiced any longer  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response Then I get someone who is rude and says yes I order the big mac deal buy 1 get 1 for a 1 The employee says they do not offer that I advise their menu out front does After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up Total lack of cust serv service he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up no apology or anything This happened each time I went there Cmon man"
5,DD has great food friendly staff and a wonderful patio The breakfast menu is the best in downtown Scottsdale DD is also great for lunch and early evening The Happy Hour menu is a great value I have been there many times and the food and service is consistently top rate
5,"The Farm at South Mountain is a splendid little slice of the country right here in the middle of the desert

The plentiful green grass spotted with picnic tables makes me want to plan a family reunion There are gardens and walkways to explore From first glance The Farm is a quaint familyrun farmhouse

Visit Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast and you wont be disappointed Ive personally enjoyed the Morning Glory Benedict on several occasions while my brother is a big fan of the Farm Monte Cristo Both dishes are made with as many local ingredients as possible mmm localicious 

The Farm Monte Cristo is about as close as any breakfast food gets to groingrabbingly delicious a la Homer Simpson Its slow baked ham over easy eggs and melted cheese between two generous pieces of French Toast Served with warm maple syrup this is it folks The granddaddy of breakfast foods 

The service here is generally solid Our servers tend to be interesting friendly and adorable all good qualities to have when youre serving breakfast to someone who isnt happy about being up early

Ill return and return and return Im hooked

I only wish Morning Glory wasnt closed for the summer Killing me"
5,Just got 5 Diamond Dermabrasion  On Arms Back and Face and I Love it  She is a perfectionist  Organize Clean and the most amazing quality service  she finished my facial with Ice I basically melted This is My Best present for My coming B Day  this Sunday I will Look like I am in High School this weekend with m Super Fresh Skin PaulGStudiocom highly recommends this better that The Red Door service and amazing and real Customer Service She has a 12 off coupon on the entrance of the building for the first service  Please Enjoy
5,"Been going to Don and Charlies for years now  Its kind of a family tradition  

A sports hangout you may see some players and coaches during the off season as Scottsdale is a big place for spring training  This delighted my single girlfriends who took every opportunity to flirt the entire time I visited with them

The bar is roomy and comfortable with more than ample stools to accommodate my generous tush Say hello to Shelley who is mi favorito bartender  You are welcome to dine at the bar but the dining room is much more comfortable with a great deal of banquette seating  which I adore  I often have the veal chop or a nice big NY Strip  Twice baked potatoes creamed spinachyou know the routine in the good old boys steakhouse  The best part is the house made chopped chicken livers which are simply to die for

Valet service rounds out the numerous reasons to choose this place over others in the area  I almost forgot the comprehensive wine list including wines by the glass

A must stop when you are in Scottsdale"
5,"I was Frost bitten when the first location opened in Tucson Since 2008 I have tried numerous gelato places and none have come close to the creaminess tastiness and overall authentic fare as Frost Each dip of the spoon is reminiscent of my travels abroad in Italy with memories that bring a smile to my face and pleasure to my tongue 

The San Tan village location is 25 minutes away but the drive is worthwhile The staff is friendly helpful and armed with spoons for you to sample any flavor you wish I went with the dark chocolate and salted caramel Truly delightful Word on the street is there are 3 locations to pop up around the Phoenix area I think Tempe would be a great choice Hint hint"
1,Beware use only a credit card so you can stop payment if you need to  our sales person encouraged us to pay cash and get a 10 discount   Big mistake  Any problem youre on your ownreally On your own  Weve spent over 3000 at this store and it has been a nightmare  Delivery took  weeks longer then our sales person said  our paper work indicated There was a mistake with the fabric the paint was mismatched what was to take 10 days took 3 months  Not a darn thing was handled properly  Every call we made to customer service was routed directly  back to our  sales person We went back to the store  in person but there is no mgr no one except commission sales staff and a voice mail merry go round
5,"Dont usually give 5 stars but this is good sushi At first I was a little skeptic of all the macadamia nuts on their sushi but it is a great compliment
The rolls are original and all very good The Climaxs and the Elliot are my favorite"
5,Great activity for kids Its clean spacious and safe
1,"Received two more messages from Iolanda this morning  Thought some of you might get a kick out of reading them  Im definitely never going back to 98 South  Hope this info helps some of you  BTW dont you just love orangeheads  Doling out insults are so much easier when hiding behind a mask

19 minutes ago Obviously rebuttal is not your friend but jealously is your neighbor

9 minutes ago Thought the drink was for your gentleman friend but your the one that had to abandoned itYou really shouldnt have your picture posted pug I mean easy targetLets go west side yeppie"
5,"Wow what a fun little antiqueetc store I stumbled across the other day  I stopped in at the Starbucks for a refresher and noticed all of this funky stuff out in front of the store  I went inside and it was a combination of an 19th century hardware store and art walk  There was just a little bit of everything
some vintage shabby chic crystal door pulls  industrial  toys The owners are great and are going to help me find a little period table Ive been searching for Lot of great accents  Im hooked  Ill be back with a vengence"
5,AMAZING Everything we had was the best we have eaten sushi crab cakes oysters  Its a MUST if near the Scottsdale Quarter  We chose to eat there 2 nights in a row once for a reserved dinner and the other for the happy hour
5,This was the perfect lunch I got the Sacks Symphony with turkey bacon avocado sprouts tomato and cream cheese It was SO SO good The combination was prefect There was plenty of meat and toppings piled on it definitely filled me up Its clear the place is a wellloved lunch spot it was a full house at 100 I cant wait to go back
5,Great shopping place for clothes jewelry art and home decor One of those GREAT finds and the owners are really nice It has boutique clothing at affordable prices great atmosphere and FRIENDLY
1,"Totally excited to try this place out my grandparents my mom and I 4 of us came here for some Korean food It wasnt too busy just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out 

Unlike other Korean restaurants their lunch special selection is very limited Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda special B  teriyaki beefchicken no soda or special C Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken 

As we were looking at the lunch special board the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead Here comes the awkward part she then asked my mom are you Chinese Even though she is my mum looked at me all puzzled as in what does that mean The lady proceeded by pointing at the seafood pancake section on the menu and saying I dont know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot Good thing my mom didnt hear what she said or else 

So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special 699 a bulgogi 699 and a beef yakisoba 719 The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini kimchi buffet bar with trays of marinated tofu potato bean sprout kimchi broccoli and some other vegetables It also has this delicious house special hot sauce 

By the time we finished a dish of kimchi the food came so it didnt take long The spicy chicken came in a bowl about the size of an instantnoodle bowl but slightly deeper was tender with rice underneath it The chicken was definitely marinated well however the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat what a bad way to end it The bulgogi also came in a bowl with rice underneath The beef was definitely not marinated fully The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless The biggest disappointment foodwise was the beef yakisoba The noodles occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box were sweet Then there was an icecream scoop of rice topped with 3 pieces I kid you not THREE pieces of dogtagsized superdry meat 

In the end we just decided to bring the barelytouched yakisoba home for my younger brother well teenage boys tend to eat everything While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl since the Styrofoam box was lidless I went to ask for a plastic cover This is the best part the same lady stared at me pointed at the salad bar and said you cant take that home I thought there was a miscommunication so I asked again for a lid for the noodles Again she pointed at the salad bar and said you are not allowed to take the kimchi home Wow seriously Just bc my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out Look I just want to take my noodles home ok She hesitantly gave me a lid

Hey hey you we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say no stealing kimchi only if I said that to her face

Oh and when we got home my brother aka our food dumpster took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again  

Conclusion If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service please just go to Chodang Chodang is WAYYY BETTER hands down"
1,"3 months 22 emails 10 plus calls and I think we have the final refund from Budget

5,I been here once and I loved it  Food here is amazing Decor is cute felt like walking into someones home  Its communal seating so get to know other guest  Service was great but before I continueTheyre closing this weekend due to the lack of business  OMG  I recommend going before you miss out  take care Lola  what ever you want  you get 
5,I am totally addicted to this place Tons of flavors of smoothies and perfectly cooked Boba Green Tea or even Vanilla Chi  so far all the flavors Ive tried have been fantastic
5,"Words cannot express how much I love the meat shop I love it like a fat guy loves the place that sells him the best bacon he has ever had because I am and it is

Ill be honest it can be a bit intimidating walking in to the Meat Shop for the first time if you arent a chef and dont know your cuts you may be afraid but dont fear just ask for help because the staff are excellent

Whether beef pork or lamb the meat here is always the best quality and knowing its locally raised and by people who care about what they are doing makes it even better And price Ive never compared closely but I dont really think twice about the price here

Be warned If you buy meat here you will be ruined You will never again be able to purchase that saltwater packed antibiotic injected hormonally treated ammonia and pink good filled crap in your supermarket again

And that is a very very good thing"
5,I LOL just thinking about some of the cast members and skits that I have seen at Jesterz The first time I saw Jesterz I was expecting it to be pretty awkward and honeslty didnt know what to expect I was blown away how funny it got at times Good clean funny We went again soon after the first time but didnt go again for a good 2 years we went back recently and was kinda worried as the crowd was not as big as past times Even with a smaller crowd there were tons of LOL moments Writing about it kinda makes me want to go back
5,"What a great place to hike run shred Its a great hike to shake up the routine with  A steep hike with bits of scrambling to a summit with amazing views 

The only downside is theres mad crowds of people snaking their way up and down the hill I feel for humanity sake I must pass on some words of advice 

1 If you need to pass Just say Excuse Me or On your leftright or if those dont work Can I pass Dont frustrate yourself and huff and puff behind someone because they cant interpret your grunts 

2 The railing sections Yes its steep but if you see someone running down using the railing and trying to go fast LET GO and let them pass Theres this thing called gravity and it will keep you firmly on this earth Trust me youre not going to fly off into space nor topple over backwards Then you can grab the railing and pull yourself up if thats what you need to do 

3 I cant believe I have to mention this DONT FREAKIN SMOKE on the trail Apparently there are some who cant savor lifes moments without puffing on a cigarette But if I see you smoking as I hike this thing I will be forced to kick you in the shins I cant help it its what happens when I inhale second hand smoke 

4 Your trash does not add to the ambiance Pack out what you take in This includes dog owners Pick it up Nothing will decompose because this is a desert Just sayin 

5 Finally sometimes in life when we arrive to our destination and find the parking lot full one must consider finding other options Yeah you in the SUV waiting with the engine running for a spot at the nearest stall to the trail head Park down the road and walk up Ridiculous 

Happy Hiking"
5,The BEST Japanese food in AZ Guaranteed When you are looking for original Japanese food or the closest taste to Japan this would be it The sushi is soooo fresh and they always carry out items that are not available in other sushi place like uni or sweet little octopus that I love Their ramen is also superb and if you come here for lunch dont forget to check in their special of the day cause they offer a great price with superb taste and lots of variety for lunch Love this place so much
5,Im a sucker for a yummy coconut cupcake and Tammie Coe has the best around as far as Ive tasted and Ive eaten a lot of bad coconut cupcakes  all in the name of research of course  Keep em coming Tammie
5,Great pizza and awesome must have guacamole pizza appitizer
1,This place was horrible I will never go back it was over priced and the best thing I ate was the corn bread you get  before the meal  I had the chorizo stuffed tenderlion it was like chewing on a piece of rubber stuffed with soy My girl freind had  flavorless tacos with stale corn tortillas three  words it sucked sucked sucked
5,"Just fantastic I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05 a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative 

If you are not familiar a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked Kind of a handheld meat pie Cornish Pasty Co has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality 

Beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science Cornish Pasty Co has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors Its no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties Perhaps my favorite pasty from the cuisine most elusive to the British is the Carne Avadado This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las CrusesEl Paso foodie If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean 

I have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads Now that I have had the spinach mushroom walnut soup it is hart to save room for my old favorites 

Although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff but everyone is friendly and service is typically good

If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one  No clue why but everyone Ive talk to seems to agree the Tempe store has the edge on quality  

After you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you wont be here every night is your waist line"
5,The castle is what drew us here  Its just the front of a castle with a reading nook in the bottom of the tower  The 3 year old was impressed as soon as he saw it  There is also a play area with big activity walls  It was a little hard for my son to comprehend being quiet while playing  Getting to the library was confusing with the GPS  Just follow the signs and park in the garage at the end to the left when you pull in  Well worth a one time visit
1,This place is over priced and the service is horrible I went there with my feiends and the server was very rude and degrading
5,Dave at Daves Ashtanga is the best yoga teacher He is kind considerate patient and a very nice person He will take the time to show you a yoga move or asana He is very knowledgeable about different subjects What I like best is once he said here you can do nothing wrong
5,Just a quick update Took my parents here for lunch today and now I have 2 more converts If anyone is still sleeping on this place shame on you youre really missing out Why DELICIOUS food made from QUALITY ingredients and FRESHLY prepared hot to order Good stuff all around
5,I love this placefun poker 3 days a weekgreat foodgreat priceseven better people
5,"Fuego Bistro is one of my new favorites A couple people have recommended it to me so my boyfriend and I decided to try it for restaurant week 

We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation to have a drink on the patio The staff was super welcoming and friendly Matt enjoyed a mai tai and I had a red sangria  both very refreshing Our table was ready right on time and we had an awesome waitress who gave great suggestions on ordering there were so many good looking options on their restaurant week menu Were sharers so we ordered with that in mind 

Drinks 
We got the pomegranate mojito very refreshing and a peachblood orange mojito sweet but very good

Starters 
Signature empanadas Tasty The focus was the meat I would have preferred more vegetables inside
Sauteed prawns The star here were the sauces  delicious

Entrees 
Cola Braised Short Ribs AMAZING Some of the best weve ever had The short ribs were very tender and not fatty at all The flavor was so good
Pernil Asado shredded pork So delicious I made little tacos with their fresh corn tortillas 

Sides 
Green chili cornbread casserole A little drier than I had imagined but great flavor 
Maple chiliglazed carrots The glaze didnt really stand out to me but good as far as baby carrots go
Jalapeno creamed corn I was pleasantly surprised  really enjoyed this one 
Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes A great side with the short rib 

Dessert By this point we knew wed need to be rolled out of the restaurant but we HAD to have dessert since it was part of restaurant week 
Chocolate chip bread pudding Really good chocolate chip bread with scoops of malted chocolate crisp ice cream This was a lot of food after that meal but I savored the bites I had The ice cream was excellent
Banana burrito exactly what youd picture with scoops of the same icecream  delicious 

I cant wait to go back to Fuego and tell my friends about it Great service charming atmosphere and excellent dishes Fuego is a winner"
5,"Never thought Id review a supermarket but since its tough times for alot of people out there Id like to share my 2 cents

First of all you dont need a card  The deals are for everyone and it makes it hasslefree during checkout  Now about the deals  I find that Albertsons has the lowest prices and best deals and you can find them amonst any product youre looking for  Its WAY cheaper than Safeway for sure

This is what i found yesterday  88 cents for 2 yes two snicker bars or other comparable chocolate bars 1 for a bag of lifesavor hard candies and 1499 for a 24 bottle case of coors light  They also had 69 cent bags of frozen veggies that people were buying like crazy  Also this location has really good cuts of meat  Im Korean and was so excited that they had short ribs cut perfectly for Kalbi jjim korean braised shortribs and for 399 a pound it was quite a deal"
5,"Stopped back in here today for lunch with Arlin B Robyn N  Mike C  Theyre still delivering the same upscale Asian Buffet experience here as before including atmosphere food  table service that are just tops so its Woohoo again for this excellent restaurant     

See previous review for more details  Weekday Lunch Buffet is still 11991079 Sr"

435 water and feet in chair only 13 minutes and painting toes Prepped and painted fingernails from the chair in 20 minutes 35 minutes in all Told owner I was unhappy and she said that a kid manipedii was 35 minutes then later 35 to 45 minutes Tiffany never let it dry between coats so when she sat her under the light she told her only 5 more minutes and I stopped her She said only the under coats will be wet and the top will be dry I told her Really because you never even let it dry between coats  She said not 4 coat Base 2 color and top is 4  well top and base dry fast she saidOwner said fast or slow it doesnt matter as long as the polish looks good and it looks good I didnt tip her on purposenot because Im poor I got poor service I would expect this for a color change but not a spa pedicuremanicure  Very disappointed  Youd think the owners would realize that all the other patrons saw her take advantage of us  Get anyone but Tiffany unless you want a quick job"
5,"I had a great burger experience here and intend to return the next time I am craving a Fuddburger I also got to introduce a friend to Fuddruckers for the first time so it was a cherrypoppin adventure Not only are the burgers here tasty but I love the fact that you get to pick and choose the toppings from their selfserve produce and condiment bars One of my favorite things on french fries is Heinz 57 sauce and Fuddruckers is truly awesome for including that amongst its vast condiment selection

As a professed condiment whore I was thrilled to discover a new flavor of Tabasco I have never encountered before and I like to think I really know my Tabasco products having lived in Louisiana for years This Fuddruckers specialorders the Sweet  Spicy variety of Tabasco which is not only great on a burger but would work as an eggroll dipping sauce Knowing that I must have it for home use my dining partner graciously approached the manager who arranged to allow him to purchase a bottle This was just one example of how efficient helpful and friendly the staff here are Next visit I will demand to meet the one who refers to himself only as Mr Crusty Baker see photos

The restaurant also has a lot of shiny fun decor evoking shameless Americana and Route 66 roadside culture The bright colors and the overindulgence in fast food goodness contributes to a heightened state of arousal that can only be described as a Burger Party Contact High You can just feel the burger love the afterglow punctuated by the difficult click of the seat belt as you strap in for a ride back to a somber lessgluttonous reality"
5,"True fine dining has come to the Valley

If you are looking to have a special dinner this is the place  And plan on spending 3 hours as it is a true culinary experience

The tasting menu consists of options of 4 5 or 6 courses and they can be paired with wine if you like  This is the way to go and even for tasting portions they are not micromini

The choices for each course are extensive  At least 610 each  AND the coolest part is that you wont find any ingredient repeated twice  NONE  Yes you might find tomatoes in the same night but they wont be the same type  Thats not easy to pull off considering the variety of the menu

But while you are between courses Chef Binkley will send out numerous amuse bouche  which if you dont know are tiny little one bit or one gulp appetizers like mini sliders the size of a half dollar or pancetta mousse in a shot glass

We ate there for my exHs bday and had 8 amuse bouche  Also if you let them know in advance you are there for a special occasion you will get custom printed menus for everyone at the table mentioning the special event

The ONLY drawback is the atmosphere  It definitely doesnt fit the quality and beauty of the food  But I still give it a 5 as the food is superb

If you are a true foodie GO I was excited the whole meal as I couldnt wait to see what came out next   If you are a meat and potatoes type with an uneducated palate save your time and money since you wont appreciate the menu at all"
5,"Ive been coming here for several years  Cant find my first review  I guess it was too long ago  So here comes another one
The woman who runs the place  Ive forgotten her name  She is one of the most gracious friendly and kind people you can ever hope to meet
When I go there sometimes with and some times without my wife I alway order the small sausage sandwich  With ajvar and onion this cant be beat no matter how you my search around  The sausages cevap are delicious and whats unusual is that the bread is almost as good as the sausages  Simply delicious from all points of view  They make their own sausages and their own bread from scratch  In fact they make everything from scratch right there in the restaurant  Their soups are do die for
A very favorite of ours
I give this a 5 star because in the BosnianJugoslavian cuisine catagory this cant be beaten
One more thing worth mentioning  her Baklava is top of the mark  Its not as sweet as what you find in other restaurants  
Everything is simply top shelf"
5,"Try the Chicken Parmesan  Its the best Ive ever had Quite possibly When I worked in that area we would hit it for lunch once a week Donna is awesome in a takenoshitbutstilltakecareofyou kind of way She calls it as she sees it and I think thats great By your third visit she will most likely know what you are gunna order
I cant comment on the rest of the menu as Ive only ordered the Chicken Parm Yeah its that good"
1,"I parked in the Parking Garage got my parking ticket validated and still owed money for parking  The parking validation was worth 300  The charge for parking was 500 with 200 credit for the validation not the 300 I was promised  I paid the remaining 300 charge but then the machine wouldnt give me a receipt

I am never going back to this location  It is off my radar from now on"
5,"Impossibly good Italian deli in the middle of the desert Huge sandwiches on the most incredible bread youve ever had outside of NY As someone who ate here 3 times in a 24 hr period I feel especially compelled to tell you about their cheesesteak HOLYSHIT Easily the most decadent flavorful cheesesteak Ive had in a VERY long time  and I live 15 minutes outside of Philly Im still in disbelief that they could pull something like that off Ask for yours on the soft roll

I should also mention the sausage  peppers  onion sandwich which was really good I suspect they make their own sausage which elevates them to superstar status in my book The chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well

I dont do cold subs but the ones I saw coming out of the kitchen looked huge and tasty Perhaps I will try their pizza next time Im in town"
5,"This was my first experience with Lush with many more to follow  I stumbled into the store because I could smell it 4 stores down and I was drawn in by the aroma I dont even thing I read the name on the signI just followed my nose  I had never seen anything like it  The giant blocks of soap the colorful bathbombs the bubble bars that looked like little cakes and so much more  It was late December so the sales staff told me that any leftover Christmas items were buy 1 get 2 free what a deal on my first visit  They demonstrated a bath bomb for me and I was MESMERIZED  I got 6 Christmas bath bombs 4 of them for free and 3 travelsized Snow Fairy shower gels another Christmas product and by far one of my favorite Lush products EVER  I also got some nonholiday bath bombs and melts because they were just too heavenly to pass up I got a Youki Hi bath bomb my favorite bath bomb ever which was sadly discontinued sometime last year  I also got my first piece of Lush soap Sexy Peel all the citrus just makes me smile when I use this soap Its sunshine in your shower

Since I used to work in the mall I would go into Lush whenever I had a break and get a couple things and the staff always recognized me  They even offered me a handcream sample one day when I was complaining of dry hands  I brought some of my friends from school in and told the girl behind the counter that they were newbies so she rushed out from behind the counter to demonstrate EVERYTHING in the store  Literally she showed us bath bombs bubble bars face cleansers and toners massage bars and dusting powders  I was so impressed by her powder demo that I bought some Candy Fluff dusting powder another item that has since been discontinued  Vanilla Puff powder is a nice substitute

This store holds a special place in my heart because it was the first Lush store I ever went to and I will forever have fond memories of the staff that dazzled me and every time I smell Sexy Peel Soap or SnowFairy Shower Gel I am reminded of that magical day "
1,8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg two greasy strips of bacon and a stale muffin They say its pricy because they get it local It has to have substance to be considered anything So whack
1,I heard good things about this place and was looking forward to what the basement atmosphere would feel like lowbrow a little seedy etc Sadly too many middleaged men wearing flip flops out on a Friday night Flip flops UGHin Winter Also our waiter SUCKED He acted like he had a hard night and was unwilling to suggest a beer so I am sure he spit in my draftAnyhoo does not matter as I will not return
1,"Place is alright but for the waitress poor service and things sent over we didnt order  We sent them back but had  additional items brought and not brought on the tab anyway  She said me that couldnt happen and refused to take it off Waitress included autograt 

I have been here a dozen times and never get great service but enjoy myself  This time will be my last"
5,"Yen has amazing sushi I would say that they have the best sushi in AZ You have to try it to see how amazing it is The service is great and I feel like I just stepped into Japan The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date D

There is only one thing I dont like Sometimes it gets to busy so make sure to get there early around 7 PM if you want to be seated right away"
1,"The staff is friendly But the physical hotel itself itself is comparable to a 2 star motel The Holiday Express I stayed at is better than this Priceline tricked me when I requested for a 4 star and indicated that this was a 4 star in name your own price

Cons
1 They have cactus in the parking lot where when I got home late it was dark poorly lit lot and opened my car door step out of the car and step on to cactus severely injuring my foot to where I can not walk anymore Who puts low cactus in a dimly lit parking lot where when you get out of a car someone can step on it Being injured on vacation is no fun and very painful
2 hotel room and property is old like from the 1980s though the front desk boy told me that the rooms were newly renovated
3 Given the previous reviews I asked for a quiet room but was given a room where the squeeking and thumping and wall shaking woke me up at 5 in the morning The neighbors flushing the toilet showering and running water can all be heard
4 the bathroom door is so jammed that it requires both hands all of my body wait and a few minutes of wrestling with it to openclose it
5 Requested a single bed however upon arrival was told that it would be 30extra a night for a single bed instead of 2 doubles
6 80s style tube TV 
7 pink 80s decor
8 worn down bed with body dent in it
9 wifi costs 999for 24 hours even though its signal is only 1 bar
10 AC blasts loudly on and off during the night
11 curtains are cut half way so tons of light comes in to the room in the morning 

pros 
1 location
2 staff smiles and says hi
3 cleaning staff does a good job"
5,Lives up to the local fuss Quick cheap tasty and one of the few fast Mexican food restaurants that utilize yellow cheese which is my cardinal rule of good Mexican food
5,Ive stayed at several hotels in the Hyatt Place chain and they are all great but this one in particular stands out as having the friendliest most helpful staff
1,"I havent yelped in about 2 months and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me  Well this place was that bad 

First impressions were all right  the outside bar was neat w good views of downtown and the fire pits were nice  No beers on tap though and seriously whats with the hiphop club DJ at 700 pm  Come on guys way too early for that

It wasnt too long before three of us were seated and after about 10 minutes our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to  oh wait thats right no menus yet good job  Ok so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls which had a filling of lettuce a single strip of carrot and noodles  Seriously  Main course I ordered the curry which turned out to be the worst curry in the world  I dont even know if it was curry it was more like a bowl of thick yellow soup with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in  Yuck  And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice  Im sorry isnt it supposed to be the other way around  My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was I think they had some sort of stir fry which they said was bland and pointless

So yeah I dont recommend this place  Instead head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food"
5,"Being a very experienced pho eater I must say that the pho at the BlueMoon is excellent  That plus the pho is 50 off so that must have added to my utility  Veggies were fresh and the service friendly  Oh and the appetizer came out only a minute after ordering  Meal was hot and came out just as we finished the appetizer

Spent a total of 1361 including tax for 2 large bowls of pho a Thai ice tea and a order of fresh spring rolls  Our bellies were stuffed and wallets intact

Will eat here again"
5,"Love their pizza
Very fresh Their cannoli was really good too
They seem to have great selection of wines"
5,"Beaver Choice is an excellent place which I have had the chance to visit three or four times  This is about as homecooked as you can get in a restaurant  Its like eating at Moms house if Mom happens to be Swedish

Ive had a few of the entrees  schnitzel cordon bleu pork medallions seared gravlax  and all were delicious  Especially the gravlax

The sides are also great and you usually get three per meal

The poutine is perhaps not as good as what youd get in Quebec but its easily the best Ive had in Arizona  The fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points

I have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty the Beaver Supreme  This mess of chocolate meringue cream mandarin orange and possibly a few other things is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting but ultimately find your free will diminished invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes

Also it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap  I just have to ask why would anyone go to a Scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap  Can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a Viking camp and order a chicken wrap  Your head would be off before you could recite one measly Odinian incantation"
1,I was not impressed The food was bad  expensive The wait is ridiculous Dont go
1,"This was the best cameraphotography store in the valley  It has now been reimagined and renamed as Photomart upon its move to Scottsdale  I recently visited the new locationand I was shocked  The store was extremely small had very little to sell I didnt even see a camera on display  They did carry some glassbut mostly a very small selection of accessories  I didnt even recognize any of the former employees  

I encourage all the former loyal Photomark customers to visit Photomart  Im sure you will leave disappointed  Two thumbs down to this lemon"
5,Always a healthy fresh meal One of my favorites is the hummus and grilled chicken appetizerwhich is gynormous and I have them add in some tabbouleh then cucumbers on the side Perfection All the pitas and the seasonal specials are always super good Wine is also inexpensive if the mood strikes Otherwise great casual lunch and dinner spot that is extremely reasonable in price for the quality of food you are getting There is something for everyone here veggies kids etc If I ever moved from AZ this is the first place I would come visit upon my return Parking can get hairy at the Arcadia location and one time someone actually backed into my car when I was legally parked along a curb but that is hardly Pita Jungles fault The douche didnt even leave a note  but I digress and karma is real and nothing would keep me from coming back to Pita
1,"Its a good concept if the owners  mismanagement had bothered to keep a trendy or classy atmosphere As it is save your money get fast food  McDonalds has less grease We had to ask for plates for the appetizer platter it is meant to be shared so the sever handed my daughter 4 paper plates 

My salad wasnt a salad it was a paper plate of mixed greens  really no tomatoes nothing on it or in it other than lettuce and she threw a packet of Newmans Dressing on the table just like the ones you get at Burger King or McDonalds My steak  it was OK  I asked for medium and got medium well and that was the best part of it The steak is served on a paper plate and when I asked about utensils I was directed to go get my own from around the corner  yup plastic ware for a steak on a paper plate

My daughter had a burger and it was so greasy the bun turned soggy brown part way through then fell completely apart

Service Well lets just pretend this place is 100 do it yourself then it would be OK The waitress walked away before my daughter finished her order Never came back and asked how things were nothing Really if we were the kind to dine  dash it wouldnt have been a problem because she wouldnt have known we were gone My daughter actually had to go find the server and ask for the bill

What kills me is the employees exude an I dont care attitude which is also obvious in their actions or lack of actions and the message I got was the owner  mismanagement has accepted this lazy unfriendly service because its obvious by how poorly the place is run that its OK with them

It could be great but they would need to make a lot of changes  job 1 fire everyone  start over If I could have given them 12 a star I would have  we wont be going back"
5,Free samples One dollar churros Cheap buys Why not
1,"Let me first say that we are fans of the W Hotel and have stayed in many of their hotels around the nation and are overall happy with the accommodations and customer service  

Im a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer  After hearing MANY negative reviews from coworkers family and friends my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotelrestaurantbar

During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends we opted to give this place a try  Upon approaching the entrance of the bar security tells us that were not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt  The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any PhoenixScottsdale restaurantbar  Let me remind you thats is July in Phoenix and over onehundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent popular restaurant  The staff was flat out rude to not only us but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel

I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here  During a time of a slowing economy and tourism many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain businessthe W Hotel fell way short of this

I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting  

PhoenixScottsdale has many great places to experience so dont settle for this place"
1,Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980s attempt at a mexican restaurant  Taco Bell is a step up  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you
5,"I now consider myself an Arizonian If you drive a lot on the 101 or 51 like I do youll get your fair share of chips on your windshield Youll also have to replace a windshield like I had to do just recently Apparently chips and cracking windshields  is common in Arizona In fact I seem to recall my insurance agent telling me that insurance companies must provide this coverage in Arizona

I had a chip repaired about a year ago near the very bottom of the windshield Just recently a small very fine crack started traveling north on the windshield from the repaired chip a different vendor repaired the chip I called these guys over to my house and they said it was too long to fix so they replaced the whole windshield the next day

What great service they come out to your residence or place of business to repair or replace your windshield"
5,"I love everything at Market bistro but I especially love the salads  I always get the create your own with their homemade and delicious buttermilk Caesar dressing on the side  That dressing is totally addictive  The other thing I would wholeheartedly recommend is the Market pizza with goat cheese artichoke hearts oven roasted tomato baby spinach mozzarella parmesan and basil pesto sauce  It is probably my favorite vegetarian pizza  You can get it by the slice at lunch but have to order a whole pizza for dinner

Ive had the corn chowder with poblano chiles soup and it was great  Ive not tried the roasted garlic tomato soup but my friend loves it  Had a sandwich here once with tritip with caramelized onions but it doesnt seem to match the description of the ones currently on the menu  The only thing I havent loved so far is their Margherita pizza

Everyone here is always nice and friendly  I love that its familyowned and still doing well enough to open another location  They now have online ordering which I cant wait to try"
5,"This place far exceeded my expectations and is far better than staying at a Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton Inn This place is QUIET CLEAN and for the money you cant beat this place It includes a HOT breakfast each day which means real eggs and hash browns served to you at a sit down cafe This alone saves about 10 per person per day while traveling

This place has THREE pools nice if you dont want to hang out near the bar basketball court laundry facilities restaurant plenty of parking free wifi full kitchen great housekeeping service they cleaned our dirty dishes and a very courteous front desk staff

The only downsides were the dim lighting and not enough wastebaskets or tissue boxes But for the peace and quiet Ill take that tradeoff anyday 

This place would be excellent for hosting reunions because of the pools basketball courts and several sets of bbqs on central courtyards

If you are looking for a fancy place this isnt it But it is an incredible bargain comfortable and very quiet"
5,Always fresh and perfectly prepared This is the only place my husband will take Japanese visitors from out of town Enough said
5,Love this place Everyone is fantastic The girls up front can be spacey at times but their system is great and the email reminders are perfect
5,We were in town on Business and Pleasure and had a chance to visit Aiellos with our Children 10 and 7  What a TREMENDOUS experience it was overall and then to top it all off a chance to win dinner on the house via drawing a number out of a bucket was simply superb  We didnt win but will definitely come back next time we are in town as the food staff and overall dining experience was unbeatable
5,"We went to check out PNP for their 2 Year Anniversary show and were extremely impressed  Space 55 is the most charming space that I never wouldve known existed had it not been for this show being promoted on Yelp  The actors were amazing and we really were in awe the entire time we watched this 30 minute film being created right in front of us  Id heard of Comedy Improv but Movie Improv  I had no clue 

Special shout outs to Mark J and Jenn H our very own Phoenix yelpers who did an incredible job on Saturday night  Congrats again PNP on your 2 year anniversary  I look forward to attending future performances for sure"
5,WOW practically half price on everything compared to the chain stores  Staff is always very friendly and helpful and ive literally saved hundreds of dollars since I discovered this store just under a year ago
5,"YIKES Its a good thing that this place it a far drive for me  cuz it could spell trouble 
If you ever have a craving for a real delight and want to really enjoy a silent momenttry one of their coconut lemon or dark chocolate cupcakes Honestly I didnt care how many calories are in themI was weak in the knees 
There is standing room only in this shop   literally I think my bathroom is bigger but a big thumbs up for the cupcakes and kudos on their packaging its definitely built into the pricing"
5,I have to say I am not a big Valentines fan I dont like Hallmark holidays We ended up by chance going to MiMis for Valentines Day and they had a great menu and price for that menu for the evening I am just impressed by their service portion size and just the overall experience I just love this place
1,"My part Jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food herediarrhea lots shit my pants once anyway i like to eat in divey nonamerican cuisine This place aint seedy enough for me I suppose

I did not get ill from the food here

However

 1295 for a sandwich fries and a dollop of soggy coleslaw 

I kept hearing from my friend his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE
nope

Thought we might split one
nope

My sandwich was flavorlesserrthats a lie it tasted like stale bread

2998 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas its an effin sandwich I only had 40 only 

Left the waitress 5

Gave my friend the other 5 to put toward a plane ticket to New York where he might experience Kosher and a bit of his heritage on a more realistic scale

the fries were good tho"
5,"Habaneros is an awesome little gem stuck in the strip mall hell known as Scottsdale  If you are one looking for an original meal at a decent price try out Habaneros  
I am addicted to their chipotle sauce  You can find it in almost every item there  Try out the Shrimp or Fish tacos they are delicious  Sometimes the food takes a little while to cook and there could be a line  So be prepared if you are going there on your lunch break  The salsa is not as spicy as I would like but I am splitting hairs at this point

Go try Habaneros you wont be disappointed  Its a nice change from every unoriginal corporate restaurant you find in Scottsdale"
1,I went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is Wrong  The slow perhaps retarted staff with no customer service alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery Fuck itstick to Slices
5,I LOVE this place  Great food at great prices with great service in a great atmosphere  Great variety great spices great presentation great menu  Every entree gets a cornbread dish skillet to nibble on  I think I would love everything on the menu  Cant wait to go back and try them all  Love It
5,"I have to give them a 5 for their Guacamole and chips
I am just in love with it

Everytime I go to the US I have to go there
Cheap super tasty and I love the salad bowl option they have as I cannot eat wheat flour
The meat is always tasty and fresh and again their guacamole the best 

Always clean and fresh with friendly staff

Healthy fast food 

Just wish that we had it in Canada "
5,Fresh and delicious
5,"My boss took us here for a little Holiday lunch the other day and i have been dreaming about the burger ever since Seriously the term cheeseburger doesnt even to justice to the masterpiece they brought me And the parmesan and truffle oil fries were amazing too The decor is kind of cool sort of an American Teddy Roosevelt feel Grand old pictures deer head and dark wood mixed with high ceilings and light colors so it doesnt feel all heavy Ok back to the food 

The burger has applewood smoked bacon and grilled onions mixed into the patty It is incredibly juicy without being greasy They top it with Havarti cheese place it on a buttered grilled brioche bun and serve it with a couple of different sauces One was like a garlic butter type of sauce and the other was like a horseradish mayo I ate every single bite and didnt care that i was stuffed to the gills or looked like a pig in front of my coworkers To leave any bit of that on the plate would have been a travesty  I cant wait to take hubby here for lunch dinner would be wayyyyyyy too expensive"
1,Gross plain and simple  Ill crave some quick Chinese Food and then Im always upset  What a waste of money
5,"What a great way to spend Easter morning

After taking part in the egg hunt on the main grounds and BTW they know how to do it here Massive dumps of eggs full of goodies More than the kids could carry Plenty of photo ops Parents who werent acting out scenes from Soylent Green we made our way to this nicely upscale coffee shopcasual dining spot 

We were seated 30 minutes ahead of our reservation keeping my little guy from popping a gasket I chose the 19 breakfast buffet and considering it included a custommade omelette with organic ingredientsas well as juice and coffeeit was a steal 

Service was wonderful and the staff was sure to make us feel at home Well actually better than home because I dont have people looking after my every whim and need while at home"
1,"Simply stateda GREASY burger from start to finish

NOT 4 meThis place I will avoid while I continue on to a real good burger joint"
1,Im very displeased with the service I receive from the Republican party in Arizona  First they provide us with John McCain  Then Jan Brewer  Then they crap SB 1070 all over us which we didnt even vote on  Ive never received anything but lousy politics from these people
5,I had to do some painting and needed help locating items and suggestions from the staff and boy were they ever helpful  Nothing like Home Depot where you have to go and hunt down an employee and when you do they cant wait to get back to their break or whatever was more important than their customer  I was just overwhelmed by the courteous and quick service I received at this location  Even their quality of garden plants surpassed several other super stores
5,This is my favorite spot waterfalls everywhere beautiful flowers fun slide and great food
5,"Simply magnificent Easily the best Mexican food Ive had the pleasure of enjoying in the States I cant stop thinking about the carne asada Torta The rice and beans are the best Ive eaten Tacos are simple and delicious The most exciting part about it is that I get to go back and try the famed Bombero Burrito and other more exotic things like the lengua and menudo

You must go"
5,One of the best dining experiences we had in Phoenix And what a surprise without Yelp we would have never found this wonderful hole in the wall in a space the width of a bowling alley I had The Italian which was Pepperoni salami ham mozzarella basil tomatoes  marinara wrapped in a delicious pastry shell Imagine a gourmet hot pocket Mmmmmmmmmmmm
5,"Cafe Monarch is more than a restaurant  its an experience If I had to put an analogy to this one  I would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show I was immersed in Christophers beautiful world and entertained the entire time

As Camille H mentioned this place may not be for everyone There is no menu provided to pick things from This is not a place for a quick snack although I bet if you asked Christopher would provide it If you are a picky eater or have food allergies call ahead of time But if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish you will not be disappointed

I am not sure I would bring my five year old to this place She would enjoy it but I think my husband and I will get most out of our dining experience with a babysitter Since Christopher is a one man show  chef server host story teller etc etc each course takes awhile and my childs attention span most likely would not last through the entire meal

For a description of the amazing food we ate please see Camile Hs review She described everything perfectly

This is my new favorite place in the valley I cant wait to go back Highly highly highly recommend this experience"
5,I have been coming to Lai Lais for many years now and have never had a bad experience  The food is always great and if you mess it up you have no one to blame except yourself since you decide what all you want in your bowl lol  Sometimes I dont make it in for a year or so but the staff always remembers me and that makes me feel very much at home  Lai Lais is great
5,Ive only been here once for breakfast but I was very impressed and hope to make it back again soon
1,"I really enjoy writing reviews praising a place for great food service ambiance and value or any combination of these Unfortunately this isnt one of those reviews 

This is a fish story No not about the big one that got away Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water this is about the trout that saved the day

When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House it was earlier in the evening still happy hour though we were there for dinner not appetizers Checkedin with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 3045 minute wait for a table We knew the place was popular so werent upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner

Went to the bar to order wine and thats when our disappointment started We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders  In spite of this in the 15 minutes we waited occasionally waving and saying excuse me to get the bartenders attention we never even got so much as a Hi and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink

I had only just told my wife I wasnt willing to wait another 1530 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready Our relief was short lived however

After being seated it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table We ordered wine and water

Our wine and water came NINE minutes later a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage

We skipped an appetizer planning ahead for dessert and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries

Approximately 15 minutes later our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up sans trout 

When asked about the missing trout she said itd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up When asked why she brought the side of fries she said she thought we wanted them first a leap of logic that totally escaped us 

When our server said she could take the fries back to keep them warm until our trout was ready my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner

Finally a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone our trout arrived As I indicated in the begining it saved the day The fish was fresh perfectly prepared and exceptional

As good as the trout was however is wasnt good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable 

Spend your hard earned money somewhere else"
5,"This place is so cool
i was startled to find that Tempe has something like this
It reminded me of the CAT in Eugene
There are soo many bike parts and tools frames of all kinds
from what ive learned is that you can pay a small sum and build your own bicycle here or offer to volunteer and have your bike for free by working off the debt
i came here a while back to see if they had anything of interest and wouldnt you know it that on my way a nut and bolt fell off of my stirrup so i thought perfect now i can get another
the dude running the operation didnt charge me a thing
so i left like a 1 in the tip jar
its such a priveledge to have something like this for the community i just hope enough ppl reinvest their time into it so it can exist for generations of cyclists to come"
1,Long wait for food waitresses that dont know what theyre doing grumpy hosts and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere I plan on going ever again
5,"5 ENTHUSIASTIC STARS

This is a large well maintained botanical garden teeming with birdlife and abundant in blooming cacti succulents  other flowers

Even though it can be HOT it is very easy to spend half a day here as we did wandering the trails If you need a break there is a patio cafe where you can get a cool one

This place is a true delight and a great asset for Phoenix"
5,"5 stars Definitely

Upon walking in everything from the atmosphere decor and staff was warm and inviting We each ordered a 3 course meal and agreed on different selections The addition of a homemade mozzarella appetizer and an amazing dessert meant we each tasted 8 dishes that night 8 amazingly unique and delicious dishes 

We tasted from every section of their menu including raw butterfish and albacore cooked gnocchi and risotto and meat short rib and pork belly Pretty much everything was my favorite and a couple of glasses of Barbara complemented the meal perfectly 

It was pretty quiet on the night we visited if I may make a suggestion it would be to GO GO GO to Crudo Like now"
5,Really delicious breakfast burritos They are true Mexicanstyle I get the ham and egg breakfast burrito and it comes with cheese and a fresh tortilla They are inexpensive and really big Im so glad I work a mile from this place I go at least once a week
5,Had my Snaaz 5k walk for education very beautiful park Clean and would be perfect for walking a dog Theres lots of parking and also there is a desert in downtown Phoenix how nice Real Arizona feel I would definitely take my parents or my aunt for a nice walk on a fall morning 
1,"I have received two pedicures and a manicure from this location  I usually prefer a more spa like experience but the cost is low and I was attempting to save a few dollars  Cutting cost may not be a good thing to do when it comes to body care  I wont be returning because I am concerned about health violations

Pros
Quick service
Cheaper than the spa salon

Cons
Improper cleaning of foot baths  I thought they were good until I saw them seat a women at a used station  They only took the sprayer and rinsed the dirty bowl  I did let her know

The foot massage was more like a foot beating  About an hour later my ankles felt like I had rolled them  It took almost two weeks for them to feel normal again

The sent in the shop is of fake nails  If everyone has on a mask I would like one to"
5,Very yummy my favorite roll is the Las vegas and here they make a good one and its 12 off during happy hour I keep meaning to come for the all you can eat sushi Try the Ice Cream sushi roll this is one of the only places I know that does it and it is delicious
5,"Ive been planning a visit to the Public Market for some time now and was downtown today so I finally stopped in for lunch  I had the Friggin Chicken which was friggin delicious  The market fare is counter service but when I was ordering the cashier was very friendly and courteous and brought my food to me out on the patio

This was a very pleasant first experience sitting on the patio reading a book sipping my canned mint green tea and eating my sandwich with a side of couscous  The atmosphere was very relaxed and there were others nearby sharing a bottle of wine or just finishing up their lunch with good conversation  Speaking of the wine there was an impressive wine and craft beer selection  Ill be going back to sample the beverages very soon

On my way out I stopped at the coffee bar for a latte which was much more bold and flavorful than your Fast Food Coffee variety a great way to finish off my lunch  If youre looking for a quick inexpensive fresh and local dining experience check this place out"
1,"Ugh I dont like giving a tough review but this is a store that needs to address a couple things

1 The Service Long lines and unpleasant cashiers 
2 Outdated Store This wouldnt be so obvious if they just did a little cleanup and merchandising
3 Produce Maybe in this store they should just no offer produce The little corner in the store makes you think it was an afterthought 

I think just a couple things that wouldnt cost much money would go a long way in making this store a go to place for me Not there right now"
5,We had read about this place on  Yelp and a local had highly recommended it as well  It is located in an office building and not easy to find unless you know in advance that it is in the back of a big office building with a big parking lot  I will preface this by saying that we had just eaten the night before at a highly regarded Scottsdale restaurant in which the service was awful  Therefore this place won a lot of points with the 4 of us immediately because the service was outstanding from start to finish  The restaurant itself is huge and it is beautifully decorated and immaculate  You walk in and they have a huge open fire spit BBQ chickens and Beef  For starters we had a  Caesar Salada shrimp cocktaila bit pricey and just okay and a good house salad  I ordered their simply grilled fish of the day which was Swordfish with Guacomole on top and a corn butter on the side served with rice  It was a good portion and it was delicious  My wife had Salmon on a plank which was also very good  One of our friends had Short Ribs with Dr Pepper BBQ sauce and grits  The portion was huge and he raved about the dish Our other friend had the Duck Breast and it was very good  We had a nice wine recommended by our waitress that was reasonably priced and very good  The whole experience was excellent and we will go again when we come back to Scottsdale
5,"Love this gym Not many know its herelunch time is the best to get in Ive been a member since Feb of 2009 

While the trainers are nice its a revolving door You are better off at this gym if you know what youre doing vs needing 1to1 attention Since LA Fitness just purchased PURE this will only increase I imagine Pretty disappointed that they no longer do monthly reprograms But the gym itself is worth the monthly fee 

If youre looking for a place to be left alone to workout  this is it"
5,Our go to pizza place Dont see how they could improve in any area Customer service is excellent immaculately clean and the food is PERFECTION
5,Hands down the best cupcakes in the Phoenix market Tammie Coe comes in second with the coconut but sometimes its not as fresh as it could be at LGO Milk chocolate is great taste a sprinkle  its really chocolate not wax I had salted caramel it was wonderful Dark chocolate is decadent I did try the red velvet and it was good but Im done trying to understand red velvet I just dont get it
5,"I had a great experience with this company today  They sent out their tech Steve to fix my Samsung tv  He arrived on time and was able to quickly diagnose and fix the problem  He also provided some helpful tips to improve the performance of the tv in other areas unrelated to the issue

The service was professional prompt and efficient  I would definitely use them again in the future"
5,"I can not believe that pizza could be this good I had good pizza on a recent trip to NY and this really is the closest that I can find to the pizza out there

They say that its the water but I am skeptical of that I guess it doesnt matter what they did to make the pizza it was really really good"
5,"This is the most progressive inclusive welcoming diverse intellectually stimulating publicservice oriented church in the Valley if not the West Coast  Weve been to more than a few and can attest to that  

Pastor Jeff not only knows everyones name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life  The congregation is like one big family  Love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church  its acted upon  

If youre sick of churches that tell you what to believe in and dont act what they preach youd better check this one out  Services every Sunday at 930am"
5,Dr Ellis is compasionate caring and really demonstrates his passion for what he does The entire staff made us feel comfortable from the moment we walked in to the time we left the office They went the extra step to make sure my 5 year old was having fun at the dentist I would recommend this office to anyone who has children Dr Ellis and his team are the best
5,So happy to have another option in our great restaurant rich neighborhood The space is much larger than it appears from the street and is broken up really well into comfortable areas The open kitchen really does have an Italian country feel and the lighting gives the very large open room a warm feel Nice large bar as well Best of all is the number of walls that open up to the outsideperfect for this time of year Our server had the perfect combination of personality and humornot too much just right The menu has a great selection no matter your appetite The Burratta was nice and creamy with a nice compliment of apple slices and Rocket The potatoes with parmesan rosemary and perfect lemony aioli were off the chain I wanted an order to take home Pizza crust is very tasty and perfect texture Hanger steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned The brunch menu looks super yummywe definitely have a new hangout on the hood Great job Sam Fox
5,"Thanks to Chris Ls first review OTFM has been on my list of places to go for quite some time  Unfortunately I just cant seem to get my act together on Saturday mornings  Today was the day  I was ready by 9 am not pm

After a quick stop at the ATM we were there Yelp canvas bags in hand and not disappointed  I had to get that chocolate cherry bread from Phoenician Bakery  I sampled an itsy bitsy little piece and it was still like heaven exploded in my mouth  We also purchased zucchini bread honey which Ive already mixed with some mascarpone cheese and slathered on strawberries grapefruit marmalade yum dates and fresh flowers

The breakfast burritos from Gils Taste of Taos were some damn good burritos  Saving for next timefresh produce the lines were already long for McClendons and Im not one to wait for veggies and everything else I wanted like tamales

We saw our own Gabi Ks other half wandering down the street toohe looked so lost without her  Hope he brought her some flowers"
1,"Ugh  

A 25 min wait greeted us before anyone recognized our presence  We were offered complientary champaigne in consideration  Who drinks champainge

We were allowed to order wine prior to hearing of the chefs feast which offers a wine pairing  Thats dumb

We ordered a meatcheese plate  It contained head cheese  Hmmmm  Overpriced and oversalted

30 min later our salads came  The salads were ok and unfortunately the highlight of the meal

35 min later our main course came  Overcooked uneventful lame

I cant drink alcohol and ordered water  Twice I was left w no water for extended periods  Both times I was foced to ask for water

There were no hand towels in the unisex bathroom  Its no fun to dry your hands using toilet paper

The best part was saved for last  Quiessence automatically adds an 18 gratuity which is OK assuming the service is at least adequate  It wasnt  Further as our waiter dropped the bill he explained the 18 goes to the house and anything additional we might addd though not required is most appreciated  Egadwhy does the house need a service charge w the magnificent margins they charge for their normal food service  And why do they put their staff in the position of shaking down their patrons for tips

Although its a very nice calming setting I found myself wanting to leave after the first appy  Food service and ancillary were simply terrible  Stay away  Youll spend your 175 for 2 much better most anywhere else"
5,Amazing thrift store The owner was extremely kind and polite to me so Im not too sure why one reviewer was saying he was rude They had baskets of clothes out front that were free for homeless or needy people which I thought was great considering places like goodwill often overcharge for clothing that should be donated to those in need Great find on a Robert cavalli jacket and Jcrew pants that were literally like new Prices were completely reasonable for quality second hand clothing For sure will go back

5,"As a former Bay Area resident I have come to love and appreicate all asian food Generally I prefer Japanese and Thai over Chinese however when it comes to Iron Chef its my favorite  The location is perfect as its only a quick two or three minute drive from my house  Their food is absolutely delcious and is on par with a high end chinese restaurant  The quality of the meat fish and vegetables is just excellent and its always very consistent  I generally order the garlic chicken as I love spicy food  Its a wonderful mix of vegetables and white meat and the sauce is perfect full of flavor and not at all greasy  I also like the fact that they offer brown rice as an option and their eggrolls are some of the best Ive tasted  

The family meal for 2995 is an excellent value and is enough food for four or five people   We ordered it for the two of us and had leftovers for a week  It includes sweetsour pork broccoli beef orange chicken chow mein fried rice steamed rice soup and eggrolls  

I sure hope that Iron Chef survives the recession  I try to eat there as often as I can "
5,The bar and wait staff couldnt be better at this location of PF Changs  The food and service is better than any other Changs countrywide  We just moved here from NY and missed our local hangout  The bar tenders and wait staff have made us feel at home  We go at least once per week for wonder food drink and company with the staff and other patrons  Thank you Clint Gerry Nate Kyle Nick Angie et al
5,This is a family owned local restaurant at its best If you like to explore and support locally owned businesses you should definitely give this one a try They have a big menu and I have tried breakfast and lunch and both were excellent but the breakfast is particularly good I love the breakfast burrito to the reviewer that complained about the greasy chorizohello it is chorizo chorizo is sausage I would go out of my way to stop and eat here whenever in the general area
5,Thanks for helping me to find Valley Eyecare Center fellow Yelpers  I visited their office as a new patient and knew from the moment I walked in that it was going to be a positive experience  The receptionist was  friendly the office was modern and clean and the wait was supershort 3 mins I was impressed with care that was provided and didnt feel rushed when working with Dr Eric Clyde or his assistant  The three words that come to mind when thinking of this office are professional prompt and accurate  My visit was for a contact lens fitting so no comment on their frame selection  service
5,A yummy Mexican Sunnyslope dive  The oatmeal horchata is tasty  THE torta is really an experience
5,BBQ Chicken plate is excellent My wife says that the half order is fine Usually take orders to go and food is ready ontime We eat here on a monthly basis
5,Tim is really a very friendly and honest guy He will tell you what you need or what can wait This place is worth going to It will save you tons of money
5,"When we first got here I felt disappointed until I realized the zoo is much larger than it first appears Particularly worthy of checking out  the lions and tigers Also do not pass up the monkey walk The little squirrel monkeys are fun to watch 

Be sure to shell out the extra bucks to feed the giraffes Its a unique experience to be so close to these large yet gentle creatures Definitely my favorite part of my visit

Visit Date 111909"
5,Decided to call CityWide based on positive online reviews We suspected a slab leak and a really expensive repair Robert showed up within 20 minutes determined the source of the leak within 5 minutes and it turned out to be something really simple and inexpensive He repaired it with a brand new line we paid and he left within a half hour of us calling CityWide Very professional friendly and efficient Would definitely recommend CityWide for anyones plumbing needs
5,"Potbelly you have been handed the torch

It was a good ride Jimmy Johns but you have no locations close to my newly purchased home  Its not you its me  I promise

I love italianstyle subs  The Wreck at Potbelly is fantastic  The Wreck salad is also great for a salad  

This place is my new go to sub shack"
5,"Okay this just might sum it up I LOVE YOGURTLAND WITH ALL OF MY HEART Go get some yogurt the end 

No but seriously do go  All of these yogurt places have been popping up everywhere the past couple years and when Mojo opened up at the Biltmore I loved it but it was far away Then yogurtland opened up right next to where I live and i discovered it WAS BETTER Sooo many flavors and they change a few of them out every once in awhile They have all the normal yogurt toppings plus white chocolate sauce chocolate sauce and caramel sauce Hello Isnt this supposed to be healthy Haha it actually is if you take advantage of their freshly cut fruit I just love it I took my brother and he is the first person Ive seen to grab the biggest cup they have I asked him why and he said Its so good I can take some home and put it in the freezer for later My favorite is pistachio yogurt with gummie bears Record is 5 times in one week message me if youve beat that"
1,"And then it all changed

I think this is my very first review that has been demoted to 1 star after being on the coveted 5 star for a long time 

So where do I start After feeling dog sick for a few days I finally decided to walkin to this place because thats what they do now supposedly They take walk in patients who are seen by the NP I signed in at 820 and was not called in the back until 1000am Then I waited another 35 minutes for the NP to come in and see me By the time everything was over it was 1100am before I walked out of this place 

I asked to talk to Brenda the office manager and was brushed off twice Supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours I guess she didnt have the balls to face me at that point What could she have said really 

The front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came 10 minutes after I had already signed in When I pointed that out she said he came before me and I had to show her the sign in chart Instead of apologizing she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake 

When the NP did come see me she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about I was quite appalled I had to point out a deathly allergy that I have even though it should already be in my chart 

My final analysis In my opinion dont go here if your health and time are valuable to you"
5,What an exciting time  I am writing my first YELP review about the wonderful MOJO Yogurt  I visited yesterday afternoon   There were so many wonderful flavors to choose from and the people there were nice enough to pass out tiny little sample cups  It was a challenge narrowing down my selections to a few flavors but I somehow managed  I ended up with Birthday Cake thats right there is Birthday Cake flavored yogurt life IS good Cafe Latte and the divine Original Tart  After throwing on a few gummy bears I was a happy girl  I see in other reviews that some complained about pricing but I am willing to pay a little extra for quality and happiness
5,Thanks to Yelp I was able to find this hidden jewel  The place looks like a spanish style motel converted into a restaurant  With a cute garden in the back  I had already eaten so didnt intend on a 2nd breakfast  But stingy GF only allowed me a few bites so I had to ask Chris to whip up  another plate for me   It was my first time having chilled salmon done that way and it was so good  Everything tasted so fresh   For the price you get to drink all you want  And I must have had at least 10 glasses of the orange juice with mixed berries   The food and the atmosphere reminds me of eating in Napa CA   Will definitely return when Im in town
5,"This is one of my new favorites places to bring people who are from out of town Its something different that I think real Foodies will enjoy Although the restaurant itself is dark and cramped its worth going to over and over again 

I ordered the Shepherds Pie Pasty it was very filling and delicious Although I had to wait 20 minutes for it it was worth waiting for a fresh out of the oven pasty But if youre ever in a rush a good thing about this place is that you can call ahead and request for them to start cooking your pasty so that it is ready to be served once you arrive"
5,Apparently fellow yelper Andrew and I are meeting in our dreams over maple bacon creme brulee Im seriously glad to see that I am not the only one having subconcious yearnings for this lil dab of heaven in a cup All of the products are top notch though and who doesntlike creme brulee Communists maybe Chef Eric is awesome and so friendly too
5,I love this place sure its kinda creepy and in the middle of an odd office complex but DAMN those donut holes chocolate cake not the glazed ones are good  Not to mention the NINJA BOWLS  Good God get the Sizzling ninja top that off with a fried egg and pineapple get healthy with some brown rice and white chicken and then DRENCH that bowl with NINJA SAUCE AND SRIRACHA which comes standard btw AMAZING Dont waste your life away without having one of these ninja bowls at this donut shop i never thought i would be able to say that statement with a straight face but i did  And for those wondering they dont serve pirates some will understand this fact  Also if you come back a few times they might throw some free donut holes at YOUR FACE LIKE NINJA STARS  I joke they dont throw them but you may get some for free really though
5,"Awesome loose leaf tea spot in the North Phoenix area You can have a cuppot of tea inhouse or buy a variety of teas to go

HUGE selection of loose leaf teas If youre a tea fan a visit to Souvia is a mustdo"
5,"I have eaten here several times beforeand I dont think I have ever left upset  Ive always enjoyed my meals but this time I can honestly  say that I enjoyed all of my courses  

I was with a group of four other girls  We all started off with the amuse  It was some sort of sous vide duck on toast  It was really good  Next we had our choice out of four startersI along with three other girls had the sauteed scallop  So beautiful  Four out of five of us ordered the beef tenderloin  It melted in my mouthIt was perfectly cooked  The only bad thing is that I wanted more 
 
Finally you get to chose from four desserts  I dont like sweets so I always bring it home to the kids  But they are so beautiful
 
Now for the pricemy meal was only 13 for everything  It doesnt get any better than that  I also ordered the orangecello for an extra 3  Well worth it

Only sad part is that we were the only table thereMakes me sad  Everyone is missing out

Our server also took us on a tour of the school afterwards"
5,"I picked up some brownies as holiday treats this year and they did not disappoint 

These are the richest chocolatiest moistest biggest 3 square brownies you will find 

Im tellin ya TOTALLY worth the drive to Gilbert  except theyre taking their own holiday break right now so youll have to wait until after Jan 4 2010 to get your fix Still worth the drive and worth the wait"
5,"No question  my FAVORITE burger in the valley

I first got turned on to Lobbys at a Yelp Office Hours  httpwwwyelpcombizseptemberofficehoursatlobbystempehridkQOElzgklMRbAyWS8LhVFw   and by my checkins you can see ive frequented there since 

Ive tried a lot of other great burgers  5 Guys Smashburger etc  but IMHO none of them stack up to the food and the experience at Lobbys 

The burgers at Lobbys are so good that I crave them I want to drive across town or plan out my day so that Im in the area to get one I just feel that theres more quality ingredients with a Lobbys burger  the bun the taste the way the cheese melts over the whole patty the special sauce and the burger itself 

And just as Lynn W says the service is truly superior here and  He Lobby really cares about his business and it shows 

Ive recommended many friends to check out Lobbys and have brought a few friends here  everyone has loved it Especially my Chicago friends that live in the valley 

Lobbys burgers is that raised bar that I measure all other burger joints to"
5,By far the best asian market in the entire valley I first discovered Lee Lees tempe location and was so happy when they opened this location in the west valley  Amazing selection from produce meats and asian The staff is super nice Never have had a poor experience in all the years Shelves are clean and organized  Prices are great too
5,"This was definitely the best meal of this years holiday trip

The Kale Caesar is a very creative interpretation of the timeless classic  We loved the melted Scamorza cheese  

I had the Applewood Smoked Duck for my entree accompanied by a glass of the Siduri pinot from Willamette  The wine was perfect with the cherry sauce besides the fact that pinot is a classic pairing with duck  A glass of Siduri for 12 is a great deal too  I loved the way the duck was prepared too and it did not weigh me down afterwards like duck often can either

My wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative and delicious interpretation of sangria  Roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet corn are part of the presentation  

Dessert was the decadent Dream Pudding Jar  We always get excited about an original dessert dish and this one did not disappoint

Service was top notch all the way also"
1,Found the doctor via his website and called for an appointment The ladies that answer the phone are sweet so I felt I made a good choice I was taken into the room and a sweet girl asked me questions and told me the doctor would be right in He came in quickly and asked if I would mind if someone that was following him would be present Fine The other guy walked in along with a lady medical assistant maybe No one introduced either of them Dr Racette didnt ask me one question and didnt address any of my concerns He seemed to even brush off the questions I asked or responded with brusqueness It was very irritating as a patient to be asking questions about serious topics like skin cancer and feel blown off He prescribed a cream for me and was walking out the door minutes after seeing me and said he would have someone come in with the script He never talked to me about how the cream works or what it does Awful awful Too top it off they were supposed to call me with test results I had to call them and the gal that answered said no one called you with the results yet NO Will not see this doctor again Sorry but I actually prefer doctors that care to take the time and actually address my questions and make me feel comfortable not take 5 minutes to rush me through an appointment
5,"I honestly just got home from visiting Super Farm  I headed out their way because I wanted to try their milk  we are trying to spend our  on local businesses  It was great to actually speak to the people who raise the cows and see the cows with my own eyes 

We ended up staying for about two hours  Everyone was so friendly  We bought our gallon of milk 349 and some butter 499 and then stayed for lunch  Chef Matt  I hope I didnt forget his name introduced himself while we were buying milk and we decided to stay for lunch  The kids split a kids cheeseburger and I had the chicken salad  sandwich  It was fantastic 

After lunch we visited the baby cows the goats and then stopped and had a big glass of flavored milk 1 each  grape for my 2 yr old daughter and chocolate for my 4 yr old son  

Everyone is so nice here  my children LOVED it and did not want to leave  Worth the 40ish minute drive out there  We live in South Phoenix"
5,We use yelpcom anytime we are out of town and want a great place to eat We werent disappointed againRamiros is greatgenerous portions great prices huge selectionyou can even get most everything ala carte We were visiting my parents and told them about Ramiros They said they have driven by many many timesnot any more I had the biggest best carnitas chimichanga I have ever seen Cant wait to come back and have the taco salad Dont drive by this place
5,The best Gelato everEVER  Yeah I said it  What  Seriously the best customer service Ive experienced since the 70s  By the time I ordered I was nearly full because they encourage customers to try everything  easily 20 different favors to sample and choose from  My favorites are the dark chocolate salted caramel peach champagne and black cherry  Weve visited multiple times and have never been disappointed  same quality service and deliciousness every time  My kids referred them to a friend and he owner gave my kids free gelato on their next visit  they appreciate their customers  If your looking for your next vice check this place out
1,"Im sorry Youre too busy to look up my club card information Too busy too push the button to do the search enter my phone number and click ok

I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card And now you cant take 5 seconds to look it up for me Let me clue you in the cashiers here have always looked it up It always takes 510 seconds at most Great customer service Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated

Other Big Lots this hasnt been a problem Just the one"
5,"Still a great place to eat A little further from Los Tacos in AJ home for me since Los Tacos closed i frequent here more often

It is good I want to add that their green corn tamales are GREAT  

their Green sauce seems to be a popular choice here on YELPs reviews I like it a lot too

I plan to order more tamales for the holidays hurrah"
1,"After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 25 hour drive to Flagstaff i thought Wendys would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the gowell I was wrong

 Chicken Nuggets dry freezerburned meat with extra hard doublefried shell

 French Fries super hot crunchy overfried frenchfryshaped fryshells so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating frenchfry chips

 Junior Bacon Cheese Burger bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated

Guess what last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100 weather is hot dry crunchy tasteless food"
5,I was skeptical when I kept hearing how amazing Jimmy Johns is  So I went in and found my new favorite sandwich spot  The inside was very noisey but I liked the atmosphere  The bread had an awesome fresh taste and when I inquired about the difference between 2 sandwiches the cashier was very helpful
1,Walked in during late lunch hour Did not get acknowledged for about 5 mins When I finally got sat down and served my salad I found a hair in it Got no apology Just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away You cant pay me to go back here The waiters are rude
5,I used Full Circle Auto Body after my daughters car was in an accident They were very knowledgable and helpful about insurance issues and got the car repaired quickly They post progress of your vehicle with photos on their website which is so cool Ill definitely use them again if the occassion arises
5,I am basing this review solely on the Cauliflower Soup Holy Heaven in a cup We had Zupas cater lunch at the office so I cant speak to the actual restaurant But man I wish I had a bucket of that soup
5,"When a man falls in love its a special thing Not because his calloused hands and heart are finally softening Not even because he has found something that completes his very living soul 

Its special because he is simply and utterlyhappy

Ladies and Gentleman of YelpI have found the pizza that makes me happy

I heard all the hypebest pizza in the country Oprah says its the best The Food Network hypes it up Chris Bianco learned how to make pizza from Jesus Ok I made up the last one

My friend and pizza aficionado Lance has been known to drive in from Los Angelesjust for this pizza and then he would drive home Sometimes hed even fly in It had to be good right 

Tonight I chose Pizzeria Bianco for my birthday dinner because of the hype I had made a pathetic attempt to dine here once but myself and the individual I was with we both were intimidated by the 3 hour wait 

Is any pizza worth three hours Thats a personal judgment call That night I ended up dining at Nobuo across the pathand it was a nice meal

I digress Ive been preparing for this trip I read up on various press articles and discovered that as of last week they are open for lunch AND Mondays Perfect 

Tonight I dined with my parents My favorite dining companions 

We sat down in the very intimate dining space No wait at all Perhaps people dont know that they are open on Mondays Fine by me

The decor is nice Simple with a classic cucina feel The brick oven is the star of this place Clearly

We ordered some bread to get started It came with a little cup of high end olive oil Fantastic The crust was crisp and the bread was chewy to the point where you cant help but smile when you eat this

The pizza is phenomenal We ordered two pizzas for three people One was half Rosa and half Margherita the other was the Biancoverde  This way we were able to try three different kinds of pizza 
All three styles were phenomenal The winner of the three was the Margherita The tomato sauce doesnt overpower the mozzarella melts like a dream and a hint of basil 

The Rosa was unique and also delicious The Arizona pistachios take some getting used to but pairs well with the red onion 

The Biancoverde was much more complex Definitely a hearty pizza because of the ricotta cheese Very tasty Its topped with arugala so you will get a nice earthy and loud flavor 

Usually when I eat pizza I take a bite of the crust and then I leave the rest Not here I went through the entire pizza slice because its perfect Chewy crispy and full of happy

Take it from methis place is worth the hype Look at the reviews from other Yelpers Even the picky ones love this place

Maybe its true Maybe Chris Bianco did learn how to make pizza from Jesus Sure as hell tastes like it

Now if you are wondering about the other stuff it was also a five star experience staff friendly and attentive and the bathrooms are spotless

Worth the 3 hour wait YES Bring all your friends here YES Will I guarantee the awesome YES

300"
5,Im usually not a fan of indoor tanning but post baby I felt like I needed a little pick me up color I chose this place because of their good prices 3 tans in a lay down bed for 17 dollars The staff is so amazing and friendly and I got a nice brown tint after a couple of sessions
5,I love their food Everything has been delicious though my favorite is Bahn Mi inspired fish sandwich Get it with a side of kale salad
5,I crave their jalapeno fried rice AMAZING
5,had a cap steak for the first time Best steak i have ever had  Would recommend to anyone
5,this place is amazing  So many flavors to choose from  I LOVE this place
5,Postinos in Gilbert was stunning Amazing outdoorindoor chic atmosphere  Food and wine were excellent as expected What another great addition to the Postino family Loved it
1,Absolutely waste of time  space is this establishment Dont bother checking in with the host to be seated as I saw many people just seat themselves although there was a 20 min wait for others the staff rude uncaring  could possibly be where all the servers go that cant get a job in any other Resteraunt A complete disgrace  I would never give such a place my hard earned money I suggest you do the same

Super darling place that makes you feel so comfortable  Looks like they have computers to use i dont know if there is a charge The inside is precious decorated to the T not a single spot was missed  Our food was placed on a silver tray and handed over to us to sit in a comfy booth and enjoy our wraps and pizza  It was really good  The place is just so darn adorable its hard to concentrate on the food when everything was so POSH while you NOSH  Get it"
5,I come here at least 3 or 4 times a month Best Asian food in Phoenix however it is now closed
5,We love Roys The service is usually outstanding and the food is wonderfulThe ambience is nice and usually pretty hopping on a Saturday  My water glass is constantly being refilled because the people Roys employ are totally on the ball We have dined here 8 times over the past 2 years and have never had a mediocre meal They also have a delicious vegetarian menu if you ask your server The wine list is comprehensive and they are known for their creative cocktailsWe have dined here on both special occasions and regular Saturday nights It is kind of like being on vacation when we go since it is located in the gorgeous JW Marriott definitely in my top three Phoenix area restaurants
5,"Stopped in for the first time at PV Burger Company tonight  It was quiet only one table when I got there around 620pm  Ordered a bacon havarti burger with fries and a coke it came out to just over 9 bucks  

The burger came with lettuce tomato cucumber  pickled red onions and thousand island  It was DELICIOUS  Beautifully toasted bun great char on the meat  The pickled onions were a nice touch  The fries were skinny and crispy and had seasoned salt which brings me back to being a kid and getting fries at the food court in the mall good memories  I got a refill on my coke before I left so I dont know what another reviewer was talking about when they said there are no refills on sodas  I asked and it was no problem

My only gripe is that after I had ordered and sat down to wait for my food a couple of guys came in and the guy at the counter immediately handed them paper menus with actual descriptions of the menu items Im sure unlike the chalkboard on the wall which I would have liked  I probably would have gotten an addon for my burger if he had given me a paper menu when I was at the counter  Oh well now I know for next time because there will definitely be a next time in the near future "
1,"IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ
My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant Biltmore
This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houstons 

We deliberately went out early at 5pm  with another couple and our son He started to fuss on and off during dinner Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave other patrons were complaining That was news to us and weve seen far worse outbursts in the past from children Ironically our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself 

We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury she didnt even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy Just go home without dinner and pay the bill Of course she herself has no children 
To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family"
1,"07092008  
Just went there last week for the first and last time  I read the good reviews so I was expecting much more  I am a first generation American both my parents were German and came over in their 20s  I lived there for a few years have eaten German food all my life and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years  I really wanted to like this place as there are not many German establishments around here but this place was terrible  We were the only people in the place at 2pm and still had horrible service    We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come she would forget things we had asked her for  The waitress didnt understand German as in the German MENU options so I ordered from the menu using the English translations and she was still confused I had to POINT at the options  YES there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu  The bread was stale the schnitzel was hard there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just disgusting  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before because that is exactly what it tasted like  Plus I actually got charged the wrong prices  like lunch salad was 350 but showed up on my bill as 500 etc  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left disappointed  Waste of time and money I will not return  Maybe at dinner time things are better but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH  Yuck
Oh and the website is outdated wrong prices and discontinued menu items"
1,"I keep wanting to like this place  I want to support a local business and yet

Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance Greasepaint   Excellent and after we placed our orders for lunch I took out our SET game its a card game that does not use a traditional deck  great fun  WIthin moments the server was back at our table  You cant do that  What  Play cards  Its not gambling Maybe I was wrong but living here you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based  The owners dont allow it  They dont allow it  Its a matching game  No  Youll have to put it away

Now  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if wed finished eating and were just holding a table assuming it was busy   However this was during the gap between ordering and eating  I KNOW I shouldve just left then  Instead I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch and ice cream  

A couple months ago I foolishly decided to try again  Didnt bother with the cards this time  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my sons bread  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill but eish    

Id kind of like the Restaurant Impossible guy to come in here and give it an overhaul  I dont mind the nostalgia stuff but the place does need a solid going over"
1,This place needs to close their doors get their act together and then reopen The atmosphere is boring and it is obvious that they did the bare minimum coverup from the last restaurant The food is horribly boring and has no flavor I ordered the chicken and avocado pizza and it literally tasted like nothing We also got the nachos which was actually just a plate of chips with one tiny pinch of cheese and soggy beef In addition the server didnt put in my order for my pizza hardly apologized and then brought it to me 30 minutes after my friends were done eating One of my friends ordered the ahi tuna and it was switched with someone elses special order so that had to go back to the kitchen and be reordered as well The only thing I liked was the beer and that too took forever and I had to remind my server several times to get me a refill Way to much effort to get food and drink that is sub par at best
1,Thank you to Sarah L for bringing to my attention that the lunch menu from which I got my information about the 34 crab cake entree was for the NYC location However I did note that the crab cake appetizer at the Scottsdale location   presumably a smaller portion than the lunch entree  is 16 Yes yes It is Barneys and I understand the premium pricing What I question is how Freds scored only  I often eat out with those on a tighter foodie budget than mine the  is misleading when Oreganos is also  Just sayin
5,This place is classic goodness Everything tastes rich and fresh Has a new modern feel with a twist of luxury and artistic flare The food presentation is gorgeous and the food tastes even better then it looks In a wonderful area of town and is built in the old post office An inventive and one of a kind idea has really set apart this delicious place from any other restaurant in the valley
5,"A hole in the wall in South Phoenix 

I order The Betty Boop  a plate with 1 waffle and 1 fried chicken breast  Add a huge mason jar of the sweetest  reddest Koolaid or Sweet Tea  depending on my mood and a side of grits drowning in melted butter and Im a happy girl

Their Red Velvet Cake is also amazing 

I know fried chicken and waffles seem like an odd combination but its really interesting and satisfying  with the syrup and hot sauce for the chicken Yum Yum  

Its one of my familys favorites  

TRY IT"
5,The Roaring Fork is one of my very favorite restaurants  I am not a big fan of the environment particularly the patio and back rooms but the food more than makes up for it  The pork green chili served with warm tortillas is dreamy  I also adore the huckleberry margaritas  Cant go wrong
1,This place sucks I moved to the valley and have yet to find that go to  chinese spot sooo I decided to give this spot a try I called my order in and was assured by the employee that all the food is cooked to order always fresh So I picked up my food and what do you know I got some old azz fried rice with some microwaved shrimp WTF I give this place 2 thumbs down and I would not eat here if I was hungry as a hostage 
1,"I really hate to do this  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food

The buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items no white rice  My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre  China Garden has hands down the worst eggroll Ive eaten

Given the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars  One guy at the cashier even commented that hed been coming since 1970  I dont get it  This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at

The staff and whom I presumed to be the ownermanager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food"
5,"After a long week of being trapped in a conference room I really really needed to be outside  Pinnacle Peak helped to put me back in my normal happy place

This spot is very popular and can get really crowded on weekends  I wanted to enjoy a little bit of solitude so I arrived as the sun was rising  Good choice  there were only a few others around on this chilly morning

The 3 mile trail is an outandback route with enough ups and downs to keep it interesting  Like a stairmaster but better because you arent in a gym squished next to some icky sweaty person  The wellmaintained path is packed gravel so you can spend more time enjoying the beautiful views rather focusing on where you are stepping

For those that want to take their time and learn a little there are small signs along the route that label various plants as well as two rest points with markers to tell you the names of the mountains you can see in the distance  

Get up  Go outside  You will love it as much as I do"
5,Love it and love the GF menu  Its amazing how many dishes they have
5,Excellent service and great quality  I will always bring my alterations here  Had an emergency and needed a hem done in a couple of hours and they had it sone sooner than expected
5,Cary is one of the most honest and knowledgeable mechanics Ive ever been to He is caring to all of his customers and his shop takes the utmost care with the cars they work on I cannot recommend him strongly enough
5,The interior is very industrial and charming furnished with iron beams brick walls and simple hanging lightbulbs The lobby area has special imported drinks and other trinkets There is always a line but it usually goes pretty quick because youre distracted by all of their deserts and miscellaneous goodies on display Ive never had a meal that wasnt awesome here I usually find myself eating the simple but delicious Liberty Joe with their special spicy sauce and then finishing the meal off with a homemade snickerdoodle Whatever you end up ordering Im sure youll end up enjoying Liberty Market as greatly and as frequently as I do
5,I love happy hour  3PM to 6PM EVERYDAY This place has one of if not THE BEST 4 Grilled Chicken Quesadillas YES  Plus 4 or 5 for a mile high pile of Green Chile  Chicken Nachos  YES  And if you really want a treat9 for 3 huge fillet Mignon Tacos  Plus COLD BEER both bottle and tap plus reasonable mixed drink prices  Place is friendly bar plays classic rock most patrons seem to be regularsonce you eat there you will be too  Friendly staff especially Hostess Judith and the young man with the red hair  Ive been in the restaurant  related business for 30 years the prime phrase is CONSISTANCY and the food atmosphere and friendly people are always consistant  Consistantly great  The owner Andrew always makes a point to great everybody  New Orleans Bartender exudes Southern Hospitality  Regular Menu is a bit pricey portions could be larger but food is great
1,"We went here for a family dinner  Our family is loud and boisterous but not obnoxious  We asked to be seated in the bar since some of us wanted to watch the game  No problems so far

Our waiter was really nice at first but seemed flustered and as if he wasnt getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables  I waited tables for 12 years and this guy was nearly literally scrambling to keep up a sure sign of not enough help or lack of teamwork  Of the two hostesses ONE of them could have bothered to help him out by refilling water tea and soda for us but alas they did nothing  We waited so long for drink refills that my husband got up and saw a pitcher of coke on the bar so he poured himself a glass which he was scolded for  I could not believe it I was shocked  A guest should NEVER be treated this way  If anything someone should have apologized to my husband for not giving us what we needed for the meal 

The chips were good and they kept them coming so props to them for that  They are served with bean dip and salsa  I liked the salsa a lot not spicy enough for me but a good amount and mixture of yummy stuff including cilantro which I find many salsas dont even contain  To me it is not salsa without cilantro  The teensy bowls of salsa they bring though need some rethinking  They should either bring one per person or consider a bigger size  Its only about 2 Tablespoons and that aint much salsa beware some sides of rice and beans also come in these super tiny containers  three or four bites and its gone  Anyhow we ate tons of chips and salsa because the food took SO long to come out  Our waiter sort of apologized for this by keeping us updated that it was actually comingsomeday

Our food came out a good 3540 minutes after we ordered  Sadly two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas which came out of the kitchen very cool not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat had to wait at least 10 minutes for their tortillas so they couldnt even eat what was at the table which was getting cold  After the two missing meals came out one was the wrong meat red meat instead of chicken  More waitingthe table eats minus one  When everyone is nearly finished the right chicken taco dish comes out  It was delicious but overpriced  The chicken was nicely grilled and the tacos were served the way I like them with a little bit of onions more cilantro lettuce lime and pico de gallo  They also came with cheese but I dont like cheese on tacos  They came on tiny little corn tortillas which themselves were good but way too small to make decent tacos that didnt fall apart  Plus I ran out of  the tortillas before my meat and other stuff was gone

Our waiter was really nice except for the scolding Im still floored by that so I cant decide if he sucked or the place sucks or maybe they both doWe definately wont be back"
5,Recently I had the pleasure of eating at this great new Iron Chef Jose Garces restaurant Pulling up to the front entrance to the restaurant my girlfriend and I were greeted by extremely nice doorman who valet our vehicle for us We were a bit concerned that we were going to get wet from the rain on this day but thanks to the valet service the hotel  restaurant provide we stayed warm and dry Now I must say we were taken back from the decor inside the restaurant It was spectacular The way the restaurant is decorated just puts a smile on your face Also it gives you a feel for Iron Chef Jose Garces personality which seems to be light and fun The food is absolutely amazing We split the IGNACIO Nachos which have black beans tomato queso mixto jalapeño chile de arbol and radish and the Barbbacoa Costillas berkshire pork spare ribs chipotlecider mustard bbq they were tender juicy and delicious We tried the House Margarita the Distrito and the white Mexican Sangria both were spectacular I have never heard of a white sangria before But WOW it was amazing All of the employees we encountered were extremely nice knowledgeable and sincere This restaurant will definitely stay on my regular to do list Thanks to everyone who gave us a wonderful experience
5,"Amazing greek food Definitely try the greek fries  I always try to come here every time I am in Phoenix  Staff is also always very friendly

Also try the greek calamari  Unusually delicious"
5,Awesome Big Ben sandwich is delish and chocolatestrawberry scones is one of the best I have ever had and cant forget to mention the coffee and tea great place
1,"The food was okay but the portion sizes where the smallest I have ever seenand I am a regular to fox restaurants  

Babbo is much better"
5,"Food great  Service Excellent  I had the Frank Sinatra Calzone you choose 3 items for the fillingI suggest what I had sausage pepperoni and meatball  It was just like being back in New York  Loaded with Ricotta tooThey dont skimp here  The server was great tooDidnt catch his name but hes a burly bald headed guy with a beard  Very friendly polite attentive  Cool to look in the kitchen and see the pizzas being hand tossedWonder if the cook thinks I was looking at himWell I actually was but only because he really got into tossing the pizzas and was entertaining to watch

Go there  Eat everything  Tip big"
1,"I was so so hopeful  October in Scottsdale yummy tacosWow  Rip Off 10 Just to get in what was that for No shade unless you were buying a drink  Most places wouldnt give you salsa or taco sauce with your measly over priced taco They seemed like the vultures who didnt care about the customer just the 2 ticket they could grab from you
  I had to beg for a napkin then hunt for a place to sit feeling watched by the other vultures waiting for me to get up
I was ready to leave after 45 minutes and my Pepsi had gotten warm so I had gotten a cup of ice from the bar   I poured it in took one drink and as I was leaving to hike back to my car security stopped me and would nt let me take it out It could have booze in it  Well by then I was one angry little local Dumped it all in trash and said to my sweet daughter in law who was about to go mad with me Get me outta here She had brought her 2 year old thinking what a fun way to spend a Saturday morning and encourage our local businesses  Nope  Not good"
1,"What happened to this place  The first time I went about a year ago both the food and service were great

Second time last May I ordered the same dish and it was horrible  Drowning in sauce  But at least the service was decent

Just went a third time and it will be my last  Both the food and service were horrible  Went for lunch sat inside and it wasnt very busy  Our waiter was totally out of it and only had 4 tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things like taking our order to start  

Then even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after I asked her for it  In the meantime I counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area which is open so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins

My food was not very good and actually made me a little sick  This is a shame especially because there arent many places in Phx that have vegan choices but for the price you pay I would expect a lot more"
5,I love that this restaurant can accommodate  all types of people Its a sports bar with Family style entertainment The staff is always friendly and  they aim to please The food is always good and prices are very reasonable The bar is on one side so it splits the Families with children on the other side with an amazing area with tvs to play Xbox and wii Check this place out You wont be disappointed
1,Honestly I dont get it  I went to Dos Gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend  I had never been to Phoenix before so I was excited to see what the city had to offer  After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table  She brought us 2 beers and never came back After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously werent welcomed at Dos Gringos  So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends  What I didnt understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment  I will never return and I highly recommend you stay away from Dos Gringos as you will be disappointed
5,"I had an amazing dinner tonight at Quiessence  When we made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything we were so when we sat down we were given 3 glasses of complimentary champagne  

We started with a plate of three delicious cheeses  They have a huge selection of cheeses probably about 20 and we chose a goat a smoked gouda and a jack  All delicious and served with crostini perfectly meltinyourmouth bartlett pears pecans honey and quince paste  Great start

Our next course we shared two salads  an octopus carpaccio and field green salad  Both good

My main course was AMAZING  It was heritage turkey with mashed potatoes and carrots  I ate every bite  SO flavorful  My dad had a beef sirloin that was perfectly cooked and delicious with a side of fingerling potatoes  My mom got swordfish  It was not cooked properly when it first came out but they promptly corrected the problem so i cant fault them for that

The ambience was great including a live but not distracting singer and a warm crackling fireplace  In addition I want to give big props to the servers for knowing everything about the food they served  She knew where the fish was caught how the beef was raised what certifications the turkey farm had achieved  It is great to be able to get those kind of answers with zero attitude when you ask the question

My only reservations would be 1 definitely is slow food maybe a tad too slow but so delicious it was worth it and they said they were short staffed and 2 im not sure i buy that their seafood is sustainable  They served atlantic cod and atlantic swordfish  My understanding is that both of these fish stocks are pretty severely depleted  I asked and was told that the fisherman they buy from are committed to sustainable methods but Im not sure personally for me at least that it is possible to sustainably fish a stock that is in danger

All in all though a fantastic night and i cant wait to return"
5,My wife and I absolutely love this place  Yes its a bit pricier but yu get what you pay for excellent food and service  The patio is even cigarfriendly which is a huge plus for us  We visit often
1,"OkI told Amanda that anyplace that serves beer would have a tough time getting less than 2 stars from meI wish there were 15 however 

As covered by Amanda this bar is about as straight as they comethis bar personified would probably call bars with any hippness at all the bad F word for gay folk In fact this bar would most certainly overuse that word 

Does Puddle of Mudd Disturbed and POD know that their songs are available in karaoke form Do they make money from them Who was the first person to say damn man I can not wait to scream this song to the MIDI music only version over some beers this weekend

I had a good timebut I tend to make the best of things There was far more facial hair than head hair I hate phonetic spellings Oh lord dont ever make me go back

eff itI changed my mind 12 stars and I am rounding down"
1,Lets just say i was not to please with my experience at Nails R Us After two days my nails were lifting on about 4 nails by the end of the weekend i had 6 nails lifting so i went back and showed them and she was like its normal No it normal to lift but not after 2 days They did fix them for me free of charge but were very rude to me Will not be going back there or will not refer any of my friends there
5,Fresh breadawesome beans Raspadotostitos
5,best grilled cheese and tomato soup ever
5,Along with Bliss FEZ is another one of my fav brunch spots They have 3 specialty drinks mimosas bloody marys bellinis The service is always quick and the servers are always attentive and very patient with my ridiculous modifications They have a drink called a gspot and it is fresh grapefruit grapefruit juice ruby red vodka and soda It is unbelievable and on thursdays they are 3 i think The menu is different with kasras and stylish burgers but somehow we always fill up on the appetizers The cheese fondue and the little pyllo pockets are my favs Ive never been disappointed at FEZ and I absolutely will continue to recommend it and go back Thanks thomas for the corrections
5,"i love trader joes 

i think theyre selection of products are just GREAT i cant get enough of it

the place is clean and the people are friendly its right next to michaels which is also great its in a convenient place it seems like the people there are nuttycrunchy which i love"
5,"Attended the Table 12 Lunch  Learn event with guest Chef Mel Mecinas and was truly blown away  I have previously eaten off of the house menu so was expecting just as spectacular presentation as Chef Beau Macmillan presents  I was not disappointed

Our party started the night at Jade which I have written a review for previously  Great place wont go into much detail there

The meal started with with an entree of a rare tuna bacon asparagus and hollandaise sauce  Second course was Korean short ribs brussel spouts and lotus root kimchi  For dessert twas a bourbon banana creme with carmel popcorn and candied walnuts

The meal could not have been more amazing and the service was just as good  Have already booked the event on Aug 18"
5,"Ive often driven by here  figured Id go in  take a look sometime 
But I was looking for a clockminispeaker system that I use with my iPhone 4  

When I had my 3G I had a very bad experience where I was assured that a particular clockminispeakers I bought would work with it  but all it had was a cheap plastic adapter that the 3G kept falling out of   then they gave me a hard time about a refund

This time I was again getting either glib reassurances  nonspecific information sorry out of stocks or  NO OPEN floor samples I could look at at 3 other stores including the big A Store with a lot of Jobs not to mention conflicting info on Amazon  upon Googling  

So I thought to go into the iStore Boy was I pleasantly surprised They had open plugged in items that I could actually test my iPhone 4 in to make sure it worked Even better I began chatting with the guys there about various other iPhone   MacBook Pro issues  found they had FAR more knowledge about BOTH the phone  its peripherals and MacBook Pros and HONESTY about them than I ever got from the reallyreallysmart folks at the BigAStorewithJobs who will promise you anything 

So I would definitely go back there for honest advice  I would certainly bring in anything that needed warranty service  They also have a pretty nice selection of peripherals and better yet they know WHAT WORKS WITH WHAT"
5,As far as gourmet burger joints go this place is the bomb I am a huge fan of Deluxe Burger and now they have a run for their money Plus the parking is much easier at Zinburger I had the Zinburger and we shared sweet potato fries and regular fries Everything was delicious All 3 of had the Zinburger so not much variety at our table but we all finished our burgers and given the size of them I was pretty surprisedimpressed with all of us The burger was heavenly juicy and cooked perfectly I would definitely go back again and again
5,I work across the street and love me some Hava Java The morning crew is very friendly and the coffee is great I am a big fan of the Swiss chocolate blend or any of the flavored blends for that matter they are really flavorful without tasting at all artificial I buy Hava Java beans and brew them at home but when I stop in for a quick cup of coffee I always have a good experience
5,"This is the largest urban park Moreover that urban part is great because I am 1030 minutes from three major trailhead areas 

For hiking I like many points of entry one of my favorites is telegraph pass this is on the south side of the mountain A new recently remolded parking lot is found on desert foothills parkway There is a paved path that is about 12 a mile and at its end Telegraph pass is to the left and Desert classic is to the right

Telegraph pass grows in steepness towards the top where there are some larger stairs At the top there is a bench and you can then continue on National trail If you head west you can reach a great Ramada

From the pima canyon entrance I take the fire road to national after the initial ascent it is just some rolling hills I then make left to hidden valley where there is a great natural tunnel Follow this trail to reach fat mans pass contrary to the name there is a narrow gap that fat men cannot pass luckily you can go around this meets back up with national trail Many unique rock formations on this hike 

For shorter easier hikes from this lot you can do the east and west loops and Beverly canyon all small trails that loop and have a few nice views

For Mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so I stick to the east end of desert classic with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines its great for a novice rider"
5,"They get five stars now You know why Three little words I long to hear GlutenFree Buns OK technically thats two words but I love them nonetheless

The buns are a dollar extra but if you are like me and are tired of eating a burger with a lettuce wrap or worse with cutlery just for the illusion of a sense of normalcy they are worth it And frankly quite tasty

I dont know if all RR are serving them now or from the same bakeriesdistributors but I for one am glad for it"
5,A most unexpected gem If you are a wine drinker fabulous flights Great selection I cant say much more other than AWESOME
5,I live in the townhomes right next to this restaurant and it still took me 45 months to actually try it Absolute blasphemy as I see it now This is a charming little place decor outdated enough that its sweet again friendly servers and man great food The pesto cream sauce ravioli I believe will blow you away The wine glasses are filled high Everything is great quality Prices are mediumrange most dishes ranging from 1118 but coming with a salad or soup and bread This would be a great great date night spot
5,"I put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops  Furthermore I think that Cartel Coffee Labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement

I have to assume its called a Coffee Lab for a reason  Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling stupid names and fancy colors  If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab there are a total of 13 items  Its all about the coffee plain and simple

Then again theres really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does  The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with  These people can make a latte so pretty you really wont want to drink it until you do then youre happy you did  On top of that the selection of coffee varietals is impressive  Ive only tried one but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses  Perhaps the use of the term Lab is because theyve actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done  Either way the formula that they came up with works better than anything Ive come across before

Then again maybe Im being too hard on the other places  Its not that they have an intrinsically inferior product but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money youd use on the place anyway

I digress  Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product  If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark I honestly dont care  Their coffee is excellent and Ill be coming back for more"
5,First time having Scandinavian food everything was excellent Will return soon
5,"This place is great
If you talk to anybody they have a suggestion for a great flavor
You can bring in food from another place to enjoy and just enjoy a great atmosphere
With the music that someone has an issue with you can just talk to the DJ to get a suggestion they are MORE than accommodating
They have a great happy hour prices 
Overall great prices great people and a great time If you have the right mind "
5,This is definitely the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix The tandoori chicken and aloo tikki wraps are to die for You cannot go wrong with this place
5,"In 1999 I was discharged from the United States Marine Corps

Keeping a high and tight well maintained was a real pain in the ass because barbers dont understand what the hell its supposed to be like  I am sure that many of you who keep this style of haircut understand

Any barber can sit you in a chair and cut your hair  This guy used a razor to get skin close on the sides and a leveler no I am not kidding to make sure that the cut was even

I have gone to at least 20 barber shops in the Phoenix Mesa and Tempe area  This barber shop beats them all

This is the BEST barber shop in Phoenix  I have been a repeat customer for 9 years and I will keep going back until they close up shop"
5,"Tweet tweet  I decided to follow Market Bistro on Twitter just recently and am sure glad I did  This company really knows how to treat their followers 

I have been a fan of Market Bistro for 2 years now they have such a comfortable setting at both locations and the food is impeccable not to mention reasonably priced

I have always opted for the Market pizza a dish that includes artichokes large sundried tomatoes and a flat parmesean encrusted dough  There hasnt been one time that Ive visited Market and felt disappointed in portion size or my order  I have such an appreciation for an establishment that takes pride in their foods ingredients atmosphere and customer service methods

As for salads  If you can take the heat I would absolutely recommend the Arizona Salad  The chipotle dressing black beans rice and tortilla crisps are a terrific blend of taste for your palette  You will feel right at home here in the southwest with each and every bite

If you havent already started your car or phoned in your order at Market Im 100 sure you are crazy

BRAVO  hashtagging seems appropriate here"
5,These little sliders are tasty delicious and pretty speedy  You get two and you can get them with or without grilled onions  There is a home made type thousand island dressing on them that adds so much to these wonderous burgers   Fries are 5 star as wellalso enjoy the people watchingScottsdale at its finest
5,One word to describe this hotel quality The pools were all warm and unique The hotel has two hot tubs one that changes colors at night and is next to a man made stream the other is on its own island There are two pools a lazy river and a small pool The rooms were comfortable and the whole facility was clean One thing that must be commented on is the staff was not only efficient but they were very friendly and nice All of the food and room service I ordered was filled with superb flavor and had good presentation The hotel also has a botanical garden herb garden multiple lawns and it contains different food services I highly recommend the ranchero pulled pork tacos and the sushi The Marriott burger creme  brûlée drinks and fromage board was very good
5,As good as all the others and closer to home than most
1,"The service here was awful we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our table Finally a hostess came by and noticed nobody was helping us and got us drinks Another 15 minutes roll by and finally our server decides to make an appearance saying have you guys decided yet on what you want uhh yeah
Overall service was poor and food was just okay Wont be going back"
5,Good place to chill with a drink somewhere lowly lit and good live music All the bartenders are really nice and thats always RAD
5,Panda Garden is a family run Chinese Food Restaurant that is always friendly and most importantly delicious You can order dishes family style and theres plenty of delicious meals to try My personal favorite is the Empress Chicken sweeter then Orange Chicken but the flavor just melts in your mouth I just had the Kung Pao Two which is Chicken and Shrimp and its even better the next day as leftovers thanks to the generous portions They have a good selection of sake and beer as well This is my favorite Chinese restaurant and hope everyone else checks it out
1,Closed on Sunday  Looks like youve not only lost my Sunday dollars but my business on Monday through Saturday too
5,Beautiful hotel great pool nice restaurants fantastic service fabulous place to stay
5,"CASH AND CHECKS ONLY
OPEN 9 AM 7 DAYS A WEEK

Love this place Took my daughter here a year ago to get her very FIRST haircut We had Miss Tara who provided us with a first haircut certificate and she also had these tiny quartersize ziploc bags for my daughters very first strand of hair that she cut The haircut was 15 Along with the haircut Miss Tara styled it and put clips and glitter in her hair My daughter LOVED it 

The place itself was kidfriendly Theres a little kitchen for the kids to play with while waiting for their haircut There are 3 big kid chairs for older kids to get their haircut And there are 2 carstyled chairs for the younger kids 

I took my daughter for her SECOND haircut today We had Miss Annette She was great Again my daughter got her hair styled after her haircut and got glitter and flowers put into her hair The haircut was 15 We also got a punchcard where youre 9th haircut will be free 

This place does walkins but it is better to call and schedule an appointment since they dont have a specific openingclosing time They take CASH ONLY so keep that in mind"
5,Amazing bagels and a great staff I always get the build your bagel sandwich its heaven
5,"This was such a good experience
I was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth ache
I dont have health insurance so I didnt think I could afford a dentist
Friends and Family told me to look up a dental school and thats how I found AT Still
I called and they said they accept five Emergency patients a day at 1pm
It was 11am but I didnt care I drove straight there and I was the first patient seen at 1pm
it cost 15 to be seen 15 for the XRays and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavity

so they sent me up to oral surgery it cost me 85 to get the tooth extracted
i was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fears
It didnt hurt at all I was numbed up and the student did a good job

they gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and I have to return next week for follow  up
the follow up appointment is FREE

totally recommend this place to any and everyone"
5,"Is there a way I can give LUSH an extra star

Pros Friendly  enthusiastic staff incredible products lots of samples phenomenal smells reasonable prices and get this an HONEST company Read their bag itll make you love them more

Cons if youre sensitive to smells brace yourself  Also if youre the type that wants to be left alone while you shop beware  The staff is excited about their products

Dont miss RB hair moisturizer it drives men crazy Coalface facial cleanser  Brazen Honey exfoliating mask"
5,this place is so darn cute  You might miss it if you are driving too fast  The food is like nothing I have ever experienced  I had the pot pie mmmm was that tasty  All of the chicken and veggies are wrapped up in a pie type crust with the gravy on the side for dipping  I have never enjoyed a pot pie as much as this one  The only thing that was slightly off was the lighting is very dark and the portions are small  With that said the portions being small left us room for dessert  The dessert was out of this world  You cannot go wrong with any of their items on the menu I will be back for lunch for sure and will bring visitors to this location too
1,2nd time messing up our carry out order Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again  Hamburger with only tomato cheese and BBQ sauce had onions and lettuce when we specifically said no lettuce or onion Allergic to onions and dont like shredded lettuce Thanks to Tiler for messing up our order again Will not be back
5,"I absolutely love the food here  The sushi and Walnut Shrimp are cravings that I must give in to  This is a nice small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable Good for a casual date lunch any day their specials are a great deal and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open 
You have to try the Walnut Shrimp"
5,"Even for meat eaters Green has a lot to love A lot more than just tofu I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and its spectacular 95 of the time A few of our favorite items are the BBQ Chicken sandwich Thee Argentine sandwich the crab puffs and of course the Tsoynamis Everything is fairly priced 8 for a sandwich 750 for a bowl w your choice or rice or noodles The only thing I dont particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty The ranch that it comes with is fantastic though Also if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese Daiya tastes much better in my opinion

The atmosphere is very artsy There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy There is free wifi a booshelf will all sorts of great reading and the staff is always super friendly

Another great thing about Green is the vegan market They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with Its the only place I know of where you can find Teese Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls As an aside I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks

Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food veganized Turkey stuffing biscuits brussels sprouts asparagus cranberry sauce gravy corn pie and a drink Youll get guest speakers live music and local arts and crafts Highly recommend"
5,Burger was delicious and fresh Fries were well seasoned and crispy Huge selection of bottled sodas from across the nation Fun and good Definitely coming back
5,"Neighbors had told me how great this place is and after reading the positive YELP reviews I decided to have dinner here with my family

Friendly greeting and service from the moment we walked in the door Fast service and great food too

HUGE portions I recommend splitting entrees We ordered 2 entrees between 3 people and had 2 boxes of leftovers we took home I split the lamb kabobs and the meat was tender and juicy Hubby had the Gyros and loved them Gyros were probably enough food for 3 people

Moderate prices Averaging about 15 bucks a plate but the dinner plates come with the amazing Basmati rice with white currants almonds and maybe a touch of cinnamon

I was told they had the best cannolis in townso I had to save room for oneand they were pretty darn good 

To sum it up FASTFRIENDLYFRESH FOOD

Yummy"
5,"I just went here for the first time with my boyfriend this afternoon I got a Green Apple Snow and he got a Mocha Blast or something like that We both loved them While the drink was amazing what was even better was the quality of their boba they werent too hard or squishy and they had the perfect taste 

The shop was really clean and nice and cool I also noticed they had battleship and I think checkers and some other board games out for customers to play with They also had a computer monitor I am guessing for games I didnt go to look at it I think there was music on but I cant remember

The service was really fast but then we were the only ones there You cant use a debitcredit card for an order under 10 so we ordered an extra drink for our friend we were going to visit We asked if she could make it when we were ready to leave and she was really nice about it 

I cant say one bad thing about it If I find something else on another visit I will update As of now this is going to be my number one place to get boba"
5,Recently moved from the East Coast So glad Yelp introduced us to Il Bosco I highly recommend the Biaggia pizza Its amazing Great food and great hospitality from this small little spot
5,If you are looking for a place where the service matches the food look no further This family style AmericanizedItalian restaurant was beyond comparison The staff is very friendly and if you have children they will well entertained while stuffing their faces with amazing food From the freshly baked bread to the main coarse every bite was like a new adventure for my taste buds They have a wide variety of food but I highly recommend the pasta dishes Your mouth will thank you the moment you take your first bite
5,So after finding out I didnt have to be a juror today I decided to go to Treehouse to celebrate  I got 12 different cupcakes intending to share with my husband and friends at work of course and wasnt disappointed I love the caramel chocolate and peanut butter chocolate ones best The only ingredient I hope Treehouse considers adding is avocado since it makes vegan cupcakes decadently rich  One of the sisters who coowns and is a cobaker was a doll We both are hoping Phoenix continues to build up a variety of veggie conscientious healthydelicious places to frequent
1,"I called The Town Dump to ask if I could come in this week and interview them for an English paper about a small local business and the owner was just incredibly rude She didnt even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else When I explained that Ive heard wonderful things about their business from friends and that that sparked my interest she said Well go somewhere else
Ive never even been inside and I sure as hell wont go now Maybe its just me but I dont like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers"
5,Ive eatin a lot of pizza and can say without worries that Mama Mias is the Best Ive had  Consistency value and great service sets them apart  They also have the best take out wings in town
5,"Matts Big Breakfast is a wonderful place in the morning to feel the life of downtown Phoenix  I have eaten there 5 times in the last year and each meal was worth the 10 to 20 minute wait out side on the sidewalk  

At 930 am on Wednesday July 3 my wife Marie and I ventured downtown and decided to have breakfast out  Matts was on our mind  We waited outside only 5 minutes before getting a table by the window next to the kitchen entry  Busy place but the service was great  Quick with the coffee for Marie and ice tea for me  Marie ordered an omelet with cheese and mushrooms while I decided on the special eggs benedict  We both had the home fries 

When everything arrived the meal was very yummy  Marie in her delicate way snarfed down her omelet with a smile  My eggs benedict was on a fresh English muffin topped with ham poached eggs and a yummy hollandaise sauce  Calories be damned

The whole meal cost 2253  400 tip

Yes the place is small and youll most likely have a short wait for a table but get over that because the experience of eating good food prepared by great people is worth your time"
5,The message I received was drip is toast I dont drink coffee a terrible character fault I know but Gina and her partner are wonderful hosts and have made a cozy little space to serve delicious food and drinks I get the chai tea with soy milk I like that computers are no where to be seen only happy people eating and drinking and enjoying conversation This is a lovely little place a gem I enjoy every visit It is especially nice to bring new people in that havent been before so invite a friend to brunch because it is a nice surprise The service is great the food is made fresh and everything Ive tried is delicious even my five year old loved her nutella on toast Good things come in small packages and toast illustrates this perfectly
5,I recently tried vietnamese food maybe 3 years ago  I especially like the pho soup and spring rolls  Since then I have been trying every place I can that serves pho  Out of every place that I have been so far this place is always the one I come back to  Its a little hole in the wall type place  The kind you would drive by and never even notice if you werent looking for it  The pho has some of the best tasting broth and is a good portion  Its about average price if not closer to the cheapest I have found  It comes with a good sized plate of sprouts basil mint lime and jalapeno  The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size  The peanut sauce that comes with them for dipping tastes almost like fresh made peanut butter and has fresh ground pieces of peanut in it  The service is fairly quick and very friendly even with the fact that there is some language barrier  I was actually taken to this place for the first time by an excoworker of mine who is an old vietnamese guy  He told me himself that this is probably the best place he has found to eat pho at and based on the fact that it is usually packed with asian people during lunch time I am very inclined to believe him
5,"With a few hours past and a few tasks accomplished the next stop of my day would be at Pane Bianco  the sandwich shop from the Valleys most celebrated Chef Chris Bianco  Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunchonly hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website httpwwwpizzeriabiancocom and seven day 11a3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior

Arriving at the surprisingly large space especially when compared to Matts and JoBot from earlier that day  and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well shortly after 1130 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dinein or togo was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take any seat I wanted and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard  almost all sounding appealing but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even halfempty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity

Having debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason Id come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an appetizer which I was told would be just a few minutes and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia cans of tomatoes dried pasta and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly  the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Biancos delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego at 450 probably the most expensive Grandma Slice Ive ever had yet at the same time also probably the bestor at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre

Moving next to the original target of my desire a sandwich of Biancos House Made Mozzarella Tomatoes and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was wow  that is a lot of cheese while my second after a bite was wow  that is a lot of flavor  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing special about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works  a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper

Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans  another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch  Delicate and smooth flavorful without being overly sweet and almost thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding Ive ever had  but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt  a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Biancothough to be fair if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant and honestly that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months"
5,"I loved this place A bit pricey but excellent quality

Been here twice and havent had anything we didnt like The meat is great quality and theyll cook it how you desire as opposed to places that wont cook something below medium well

Great toppings for burgers fries and shakes Although everything is so big and filling I certainly cant have all that in one trip

Definitely a decadent tasty treat"
1,"Ok im not getting the great reviews on this place I FINALLY made it Lamars before they closed for the day and tried a couple donuts I have a few problems here The big one can we please list that only the donuts with holes are 549 for 6 Its a bit deceptive to just list the price of 6 and ring up the donuts and have them turn out to be well over 7 Makes me want to buy my donuts from someone else 
   Second these donuts are WAY over priced and they are average at best The maple bar tastes like you are eating spoon fulls of sugar they are so sweet And the rest of the donuts I tried were pretty stale This will be the first and last time I will be going to Lamars Give me Krispy Kreme or anyone else for that matter Thank god for Lamars we dont have Spudnuts in the valley because they would be out of business"
5,"I am disabled with MS The heat of summer about does me in esp in the car Because of this and because the best thing Ive ever done for myself was to buy an electric HamiltonBeach water kettle I drink TEA All day Loads of it Teavana is MUCHO EXPENSIVE though I adore it I learned of the Tea District through somebodys ad and like them very much as well But I had no idea we had a genuine tea company in Phoenix And because of HomeRun I was allowed to buy THREE vouchers And because DragonFly is so awesome they let me use all three to buy tea online and have it shipped to me all at once to avoid huge sh fees It should be here any day and I cant wait to try their Cabernet against Teavanas Opus Rouge I love red heavily tart fruity teas It doesnt matter to me if there is no white green or black tea in it In fact I prefer it to just be the fruit I drink it hot and then as it cools all day in my tea pot I keep refilling and either warm each huge travel mug with lid in the microwave or drink it room temp or even add some ice if it is particularly strong I can EASILY drop 150 at Teavana or 120 at Tea District and just touch on what I most want With your three vouchers worth 60 I got to try two bags of every flavor I most wanted except Peach as they are out of it but Holly wrote me several times and made recommendations based on what I had in my cart
 
I know I will love it and go back to order the Peach when it is in stock again Thank you so much for finding a local treasure and making it accessible

5,"Do you like trendy shitmusic and half dressed plastic surgery queens gyrating all around you while you pay twelve dollars for your appletini If your answer is yes dont bother coming here 

Dive bars are plentiful in Phoenix but the Bikini is in my hood Its a dirty unassuming place with a couple of nononsense bartenders and a good jukebox 

There are a couple of rules to follow when visiting the Bikini 

1 Bring cash Cards arent accepted the atm machine is there for decoration only as it hasnt worked in at least two years 

2 Dont make fun of the guy in the overalls and farmer hat Hes my neighbor 

3 Dont piss off the bartenders Tip them well treat them nicely and dont order more than three dirty martinis If you are nice to them they will be nice to you This includes but is not limited to the strength of your drinks the price of your drinks and whether or not you get a drink at all They take no shit 

If you cant handle it stay away The place gets crowded enough as it is"
1,"I have nothing more to add but I dont want anyone to think only a few people had  complaints about this poorly planned festival 

Oh wait I do 

I was there with my 4 year old granddaughter and my daughter since there were going to be kids attractions as well as the food trucks I thought it was nuts that 3 minutes of jumping around cost 3 But I guess it was consistent with the 4 water and 7 beers

And it would help if there was some roadway controls andor temporary signage By 11am traffic backed up down Pima from the event to Indian Bend and over towards the 101 Cars were skipping ahead and cutting into line further delaying entrance 

If success is measured by interest the festival was a success If by performance and customer satisfaction not so much And how can a vendor commit to showing and not have enough food to feed the presold ticket holders Why risk your hardfought reputation"
5,"Im so sad I didnt discover the Herb Box sooner I went for a girls lunch and was blown away  by the decor the vibe the view and the food  and this was during the winter I cant wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend goto spot for me The salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips  holy moly Theyre amazing and youll get tons of them The decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and I could seriously move in 

If you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of Arcadia Farms give Herb Box a whirl Its got the same feel but more modern Love love love it"
1,"Its been a few months since Ive been here and what a change not for the better I usually get the same thing to start with ceviche and pollo asado Both are usually quite delicious not this time

The ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least Now for the tacos Stale taco shells dried and overcooked chicken slopped on guac and no pico de gallo The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo since they did not put any on and then I was charged 100 extra Of course no manager was anywhere in sight This place simply doesnt care On the bright side the margaritas and salsa are still good but the chips were stale

Not only will I not return but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food and Ive always said Cien Agaves No more"
5,There is something for everyone on the menu Its more than pizza The service is great Get a table on the terrace and you get the view of the park and fountain I will keep going back
5,I cannot say enough good things about this place The food is amazing and the customer service is probably the best Ive ever experienced Every time my boyfriend and I dine here the owner visits with us and asks how we are etc Ive only had Pho at a couple of places in town so I cant speak to the authenticity but it tastes amazing and fresh every time Places that make good food and offer the kind of customer service these places do and family owned is always a plus for me are just priceless UnPhogettable is always worth the drive to Mesa
5,"Delicious salad pizza and wine We got the Padre pizza which is not on the menu but fig prosciutto arugula and ricotta so delicious The crust is perfect 

The best part is they have several BOTTLES of wine under 12 Yes you could usually barely get a glass for that amount Sold  We had the Four Vines ZIn that was amazing for only 1099"
5,"I go to Pros Ranch Market often for lunch sometimes several times a week Ive had the street tacos chile relleno burritos and some other tasty treats Im a huge fan of the agua fresca stand my favorites are the strawberry pineapple and horchata And the bakery oh the bakery They have everything sweet you could want including individual servings of flan and tres leches cake 

The store itself has the cheapest produce in town a giant meat counter and a great assortment of cheeses Ranch Market also has super delicious tortilla chips and salsas This is one of my favorite places to go if Im on my way to a BBQ or party there are so many options"
5,"Love this place A must stop for anyone downtown needing a snack or a drink Very good happy hour and unbelievable flavor combinations
On my last visit I was pleased to try some happy hour toasts and fish and chips Zero disappointment"
5,I have only eaten here once but i cannot wait to go back the service was phenomenal the potstickers huge and delicious the orange beef  just as good as a pf changs  I had a restaurantcom coupon purchased 10 gift card for 80 cents  Highly recommend
5,"I am not one to hang out in Downtown Phoenix before or after an event because quite frankly its boring  However when I visited Copper Blues on 2412 prior to the comedy show next door I will definitely be hanging out after events

Heres Why  They have a live band and over sixty beers on tap  Its a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside  Budweiser drafts were only 5 and soda was only 3  We didnt try their food but I hear the same owner owns both Copper and Stand Up Live so I am sure the kitchen is the same so I am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at Stand Up Live

Happy hour is 4PM to 7PM SunThurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days

On this Satuday night people were having a good time  The draft beer was perfect and fresh  The music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully

We had such a great time that me and my wife are going back to Copper Blues on 22312 to hang out and drink with friends prior to our comedy show next door

This is a nice spot and you have to check it out especially if you are going to the show next door "
5,"Its just a terrific steakhouse  One of the most upscale all around dining experiences in Phoenix 

Its expensive  Very expensive  But probably worth it  Figure 150200 for a couple

I had the double filet medallion with blue cheese melted and a wine demiglaze  Absolutely outstanding amazingly tasty meats  Equal or better than Mortons or Ruths Chris or Capitol Grill thats on the menu for tomorrow night  Smashed potatoes were very good but nothing to write home about  Veggies were pretty good

Started with the ceasar salary with a big pile of anchovies  Perhaps the best Caesar Ive ever had

Desert was the mouse cake  Good but not to die for

Their happy hour is also an excellent value  Come before six and drinks are half off and they serve little mini steak sandwhiches which are very good

Hint  If you have kids go to happy hour and have a drink or two  Cocktails are in the 7 range happy hour price  Cucumber cooler was quite nice for a cocktail  Let the kids eat the sandwiches and then head to the dining room for a couple of filets  The kids are pretty full you are nicely primed for a great steak and the complete lack of a kids menu doesnt matter  

Honestly otherwise there really arent any good kids options  I know its not a great place for kids even well behaved but sometimes you want to celebrate a special occasion with family  

It would be nice if they offered a minifilet for 12 and under for like 15 or a burger and fries for 10 for the kids  Just a thought

Anyway great experience great food  A really upscale while linen old style steakhouse kind of place to have prime beef"
5,Cozy place great amounts of food for little money they serve koolaide  Its all great I loved it both times so far once in 2003 when I went to review it for the school newspaper and again 8 years later when I drove by it and the nostalgia made me try it again with the fiance
5,Great food and very friendly service  Happy to recommend
5,Yes please This place is AMAZING I brought my family here after coming many times and everyone LOVES IT The wasabi mashed potatoes are KILLER I HIGHLY recommend I really dont know if there is anything to avoid at this place Just love it every time We have tried many dishes and they are always flavorful and fabulous
5,"Theres a reason theres a banner that reads Food Network Challenge Winner hanging in their farmer market booth Ive had Pastry Chef Chriss gingerbread cookies biscotti coconutchocolate cookies and their carrot cake and they have all been really really reaaaaally good 

But today at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market I was knocked out by what she calls Lemon Sunshine  Words can not describe how delicious their lemon and cream  graham crust tartpie is

Lemon tartspies are among my all time favorite desserts I thought that the ones I had from TKs bakeries and Veronique Mauclerc were as perfect as a lemon tartpie could be Slice Cake Designs Lemon Sunshine pie is dangerously perfect

A must try"
5,"This is my favorite breakfast  lunch place in Ahwatukee The food is excellent The service is friendly and they do what they do perfectly This isnt a place to go for elegant sit down service Its the perfect blend of selfservice meets top restaurant quality food 

Have the Croque Monsieuror add an egg to make it a Croque Madame You will not be disappointed The bread and the baked goods are so good you could make a substantial meal off them alone

Finally this is a small local business that truly cares about its community They have shown up at two community fund raising events with huge boxes of warm freshly baked cookies to donate Im grateful to have a place of this caliber in my neighborhood"
5,"I was impressed with this place I had the Mongolian Lamb and an Asahi beer It totaled 1400 before tip which I thought was reasonable for dinner and especially for a lamb dish The portions were very generous and even though I was starving when I stopped in I ended up only eating about half of the meal before getting full It was delicious Tender lamb and a great sauce

The waiter was very polite and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly It was very comfortable inside and the decor was tasteful I did not expect that one of the best Chinese restaurants of course in my opinion would be located in Avondale I feel bad for frequenting the Pei Wei on Dysart and McDowell so often when a nonchain place of this caliber is right up the road"
5,Therere times when you eat something and you want more Then there are times when you eat something and you instantly know you will never have anything quite like it For me I experienced both of those at Pizzeria Bianco My buddy and I drove almost 500 miles from Santa Barbara for a GiantsDiamondbacks game and thought wed try this place I had heard about We arrived fairly late so there was about a one hour wait but man was it worth it We ordered a Biancoverde and a Wiseguy I was a bit skeptical at first because they each didnt have tomato sauce like I was used to but I realized I dont care much for tomato sauce in the first place and Im always up for trying new things BEST DECISION OF THE DAY The Biancoverde was my favorite It was so simple 3 cheeses arugula and olive oil yet so amazing It has left me wanting more to this day The staff was nice and friendly not to mention a few cuties I will definitely drive 500 miles for it again In fact Ill be making my way to Phoenix in a few weeks JUST for the pizza
5,"i know i know this gelato is a bit on the pricier side especially when you consider that phoenix now has a bajillion gelato shops that  each offer a million and one flavors for a few washingtons HOWEVER arlecchino is definitely the BEST its worth theprice worth the drive and worth the parking hassle 

the owners are super nice and accommodating and although there is a sample limit the workers have never said no more the flavors are classic inventive fresh and authentic plus its such a cute tiny little holeinthewall shoppe that you cant help but love it in all its quaint glory"
5,"I first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the Hawaiian festival at the Tempe Town Lake a few months ago

Big deal I thought How can a Hawaiian festival be fun

Well the food was amazing And after having half a rotisserie chicken I was craving for more

A few days later I finally began my search for the perfect or near perfect Hawaiian restaurant in which I can satisfy my Hawaiian cravings

My first stop was Mai Island Grill located innear the Arizona State University campus Parking was a bit of a challenge this is especially true during the lunch hour

When I finally found a parking spot I went in and ordered I had the short ribs plate The plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice

After placing my order for the short ribs I ordered the Spam musubi

The guy preparing food replied with a laugh

Is it good I asked

Jay  the man who operates this restaurant  replied Yes its good 

Then he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs or something like that

About 10 minutes later my food was ready

The food was fantastic just what I was looking for

The prices are very reasonable Plates are about 10 and less

I also suggest that you try the fish beef grilled chicken and pork katsu

And finally I hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions Also I think it would be cool if Mai Island Grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice just a fantasy of mine

Additional Notes

 Cash Only

 Opens late in the morning and closes early in the afternoon call for exact hours

 There never seems to be any Lumpia "
1,"They added broasted chicken to their menu I love me some broasted chicken so in I went to investigate

I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken

To me it tasted rubbery and had a strange odor and it was so salty that an hour later I could still taste it I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted

I cant speak to anything else on the menu Their garlic knots for what its worth were fine"
5,"I really dont like these types of Mexican food places because I feel my mom makes better Mexican food Just a note Not all Filibertos are the same Food taste wise

This Filibertos is BOMB though They make great Spanish rice and beans All the food is great But I recommend the rolled tacos if its going to be your first time here I think its combo 8 haha They also have some old school arcade games Thats a plus for me haha 

Please stop going to Macayos they have the worst fake tasting Mexican food"
5,"Please give this place a try when youre making your next stop at Pita Jungle This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked We went on a Wednesday night around 730pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed Just the two of us on the patio which was very nice The interior and atmosphere are great Nice tables  chairs candles shelves with wine bottles and art and a very nice bar

An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves Thats the first sign of a highquality establishment They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed They gave us some good suggestions like their Iced Black Tea which is fantastic It has a few other elements to it including Lavender They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking

For our appetizers we tried the hummus and the tabooli The hummus was very creamy but a little plain We wished there was more flavor or spice to it Not a big deal That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars but 4 stars The tabooliridiculous Ive never been a fan of tabooli It usually has too much parsley But their version was balanced perfectly

For an entree I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron A huge plate of rice with great seasoning The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture The Shawarma was fresh and delicious The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely

For dessert we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava The ice cream was some of the best weve had Great flavor The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great

So in summary great atmosphere great owners outofthisworld food and very affordable Everything we had came to about 32 We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant which it definitely is not"
5,"Elmer I love you

I have since I was a senior at Chandler High Back then I was broke so I could only get a bean burrito and stripsand they were dang good 

If anyone wants to complain about strips just being chips and cheese they can suck it

Now days I am a little less broke so I always get the green chili burro And it is always so good Spicy enough to burn a little and the tortilla is always freshthanks man

And bless your little Mexican Heart you serve corn dogsso I can even come here with my crazy picky kids 

I love you Elmer I always will"
1,this is a business located in the frys grocery strip mall on mckellips and recker I wont say much but dont bother the waitless girl was about as pleasent as a hemroid the beer selection sucked I belive the owner was there at least the guy looked like the owner its always amazing to me how the service can be so horrible wowner in house
5,Did I ever write about the time I left my ipad here  Didnt realize for a couple of hours Heart racing I called emailed hoped it would be recovered What gracious responses I got an email early next morning lots of reassurances help for when how to pick up Ok so Ive reviewed this place before key words are wonderful creative dishes a light touch for subtle flavor right now Im having a delectable plate of greens shaved herbs summer squash wrapped around burrata who woulda thought but most amazing is the heart warming genuine service of all who care for you here  Oh And theres mightly fine wine on tap Heh heh
5,The food is EXCELLENT  We have been 5 times now and everything we have had has been delicious  We will continue to dine w Bill and IL Bosco  The Caprese is AWESOME
5,"This is my favorite Sushi Spot in Phoenix I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time 

The prices are very reasonable and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers

The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store It is topped with pork fish cake bamboo and seaweed I highly recommend

They even have a fried salmon skin roll which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased it was absolutely perfect

They also offer Takoyaki which is like an octopus dumpling ball You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive You have to try these during your visit

The last time that I was there I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream It was green tea ice cream surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way

If you like Sushi and you think that RA is cool hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about Your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing

Cheers and keep up the good work at the place

FYI Bring your own Saki if you need booze with your meal I say just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel"
5,"5 stars isnt enough I love the whole Briggs family I have been going to this dentist since I was 8 years old and they have always been so amazing to me I love that I walk in the door and they make me feel right at home They are so sweet and everything in that place is actually super comforting

They use the most high tech things I have ever seen and its good to know Im getting A care for my pearly whites I recommend them to everyone I know"
5,"Can not say enough good about this place  I love it  I love it  I simply love it  We have always had really great service and the food  Well the chips are thin and salty yumness and I love the salsa  They keep you filled up and arent like other places which try to ignore an empty container

Number 16 Combo is my guilty pleasure  I have had it many times the way its intended  Chicken enchiladas with red saucebut lately Ive been getting it with Fundito sauce and Ive gotta tell you  Im hooked  Try itits a little more  but SO worth it

I havent had desert since Im gluten free but the size of the fried ice cream is Gigantic  My daughter swears by it

Man I wish they were open right nowcravings have begun anew"
1,This location was a Groupon find Wont be back The girl behind the counter was nice but even though I had the groupon right in front of me she had to read it several times and I had to explain to her what I was supposed to be getting with it The red light therapy is a nice idea But the room the bed was in was lacking They should hire an exterminator not leave sticky bug traps down with dead bugs all over the floor where people generally have bare feet Yuck
5,Best Vietnamese food Ive had and Ive been to some very good Vietnamese places Very fresh and delicious
5,"I Felt a sin coming on 
 if i could give 10 stars i would 

Let me set the scene for you of this Kazilicious Sunday night 

We enter through  a solid planked door set in the rear oh yes the
truth is inside candlelit passageway leads you into a sexysultry
stone interior that is softened by the plush seating  dim lighting
wine barrels  i give his hand a squeeze and smile because we have
hit the mother load within this sinfully sexy speakeasy The Tuscan
colors coupled with the stone deep rich decadent  His hand on
the small of my back as we approach our seats as the intimacy and
ambiance takes hold 

A bowl of olives 3 cheese fondue with apple the Tuscany pizza

firmdipbite yesssss SO beyond sexy here

Oh and the wine nectar of the gods sign of fertility  here in this
setting it is like Ambrosia and your inner God or Goddess will surely
blossom and romance will bloom 
It seems like thousands of labels here  we went with the  M
Chapoutier Le Sizeranne 98 Heady earthy smoky deep sweet and
ripe the smell of currants and berries lovely texture full bodied
DIVINE  let the flirting begin coy toying of the glass stem
sweet smiles love words escaping on a whisper  between sips

We spent around 200 worth every penny in my opinion 

Prior to the Kaz  the Rokerij was just about the sexiest spot to me

So to recap  SEXY SULTRYSEDUCTIVE  poshswank 
Good Service  lush wine selection yummy tidbits 
Ambiance up the wazoooo 

A heady experience this is where lovers go a prelude to the
interlude of love "
5,Went today for the first time The quesadillas were the best Ive ever had My husband had the Cuban sandwich which of course I triedit was equally delicious The atmosphere made me feel like I was back in the Bahamas And not to forget the staff We sat at the bar and the bartenders were wonderful and so nice
5,I dream about their chopped saladI too would use it as my screen saver if I didnt share a computer
5,This is the best restaurant chain EVER  I love EVERYTHING there and the service has always been A  The fried zucchini strips appetizer are the best in the world the Caesar salad is the best I ever had even their croutons on the salad are better than any  Olive oil herb dip is Fabulous the warm bread is like no other  Most of the dinners that I have tried have been excellent but the Chicken Bryan is magnificent  Waiters and manager the best
5,"Fun little place to just explore and TRY so many different samplings    The staff was great and super friendly  The lemon cupcakes were AMAZING  

Little tip  buy a baguette to try all the great olive oils and tapenades"
5,"Melrose Pharmacy is my goto pharmacy  Not only is it in my neighborhood it is independently owned and operated by Teresa Stickler  Her and her husband Kurt are people who care about the community  The fact that they provide a level of service that their chain store competitors can only dream of is a is the icing on the cake  They are also lightening quick dispensing most prescriptions while you wait

Moreover they are a FULL  service pharmacy they also offer delivery handy when you feel like you are on the verge of death and useful recommendations on the pros and cons on a on nonprescription drugs and vitamins often recommending the lower priced generic brand  In addition you can find a wide variety of homeopathic products as well as a selection of snacks books and small gifts

Even if you dont need to get a prescription filled its worth a visit to check out the retro interior and grab and grab a vintage bottled pop and candy  Better yet stop by on a First Friday when the pharmacy features live music and frequent art shows in the studio in the same complex"
5,Loved this place Was searching for a great authentic BBQ place and this is it
5,"Wow If youre into ownerdriven husbandandwife run casual and unpretentious yet upperclasscomfortable fine environs food service wine and music acoustic live music 3xwk with no cover the kind of place where everyone talks towelcomes everyone yet no one is nosy or cliquish where the whole place cheerfully claps when Mrs Owner breaks a glass and someone calls out its earlier than that normally happens  free wifi where you have a nice patio with heaters and a frontrow Fountain view wine by the bottle from their extensive retail collection or yours  with just a 5 corkage as well as a decent 79 reds and 79 whites selection by the glass for 710 a great craft beer selection Union Jack IPA couches nice hightops an lshaped bar great local artwork also for sale this will be your new favorite place

If you like stuffy overpriced boring seetobeseen places with angry or no music this place isnt for you

Second time here and Mr Owner greets me by name  Are you kidding Does that happen anymore And when I say to him thats cool someone else in the bar comments about how I must be new because thats just how they do it here

You can order anything off the menu from next door Euro Pizza Cafe for no upcharge Amazing Get the Dr Oz Sautéed Veggies Trust me 

This place has a great vibe and one part of me hopes these positive reviews dont result in oppressive crowds but on the other hand something tells me theyd handle it with a smile and 5 star service

Get here Just get here"
5,This is a great Thai food restaurant My husband and I have been here a few times and have been very pleased with the food as well as the service We usually order a few curries and of course the pad Thai The food is always consistently good Good Thai food is sometimes hard to find you definitely wont be disappointed here
5,"I came here for the first time ever on Mothers Day They were packed the line was out the door and down the path Still they managed to get everyone seated and quickly attended to
We were a party of 10  our server was so great and i am sorry to say i do not remember her name She had all 10 drinks refilled continuously Brought us lemons and cleared the table with amazing speed as well as taking care of a completely full restaurant packed with Children that were running under foot   The only down part was that they had plastic dishes but with all those people what are your choices
I loved the food I had shrimp and fish and vegetables  Nothing fried       The best part for me was the Chocolate fondu  Although there were many different choices You could never say that you did not like what they were serving  have seen a million adverts for this place and i am happy that i finally got to go"
1,"I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday nightSaturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv

I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy The waitress was pretty nice did everything expected for a waitress and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to However those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant

I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE The flavor was very bland and half cold The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well

I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made Needless to say I wont be eating at Hooters anytime soon"
5,"The best 

From my first shredded beef taco almost a year ago  i have been lovin this place
I also love the number 13 combo platter Mini beef chimis Gauc rice and beans 

The tacos are 5 star fresh and yum   AND reasonably priced"
5,"We showed up out of the blue on Valentines night looking for food We got a seat at the sushi bar right away but the place was otherwise packed I guess we were lucky We passed on the Vday prixfixe menu and decided to order as we ate

Our waitress was visibly perturbed by my wifes order of tap water to drink and vegetable tempura to start Judging by her expression she took us for deadbeats it wasnt offensive but hilarious were old enough to be confident in our own opinions of ourselves Anyway the vibe at the W was definitely people trying hard to be cool and ofthemoment

In any event we struck up a conversation with the chef behind the bar where we were sitting We initially ordered some basic sashimi dishes but when I asked the chef for suggestions he started rattling off a series of custom creations he could make So we let him do his best and he turned out a great collection of sashimi dishes none at least as far as I could tell on the menu 

We had a great meal and we would definitely return at least if we didnt live in San Diego

The waitress eventually warmed up probably thawing as she watched us eat through plate after plate of sashimi"
5,I didnt know what to expect from this store It was over 105° so I wanted something cold You get samples to help you or confuse you in to many choices I went with the basic cookies cream mixed with vanilla carmel Do yourself a favor  get the large so you can mix plus go on Thursday for double stamp day
5,Absolutely unbelievable This is so worth the drive from Scottsdale to Tempe But get there early as they close early and run out of food Its so delicious my mouth is watering just thinking about it I love French pastries crepes and desserts The macaroons melt in your mouth I will be returning soon
5,Best Ice cream sandwhich I have ever had
5,Took Maddie here for a quick nail trim was super impressed Friendly staff prompt service and light on the wallet What more could you want My dog is with me always so I wont need the boarding services but will definitely make this my new pet vet My coworkers have gone to the vaccination clinic they have where they were also impressed by the service and low price Thumbs up for this place
5,Wow this place is still here I went there as a girl 15 years ago with the family on a regular basis If its still around then it MUST be good
5,"This is my favorite venueweve held two events here and Ive attended another four
As an attendee its clean bright FREE parking good food constantly refreshed coffee and beverages and good layout  I love it  As a planner its a good deal for what you get and its a well managed event end to end  Conference staff are easy to work with flexible and they are there to support you  IT works and it works well its a great facility food service and staff  Good open expo area too if you have vendors advicedo not use a separate room if you have a lot of vendorsput them in the main ballroom andor the vestibule not in any other room  Vendors like to be showcased and have traffic not shuttled off to a low traffic low visibility area regardless of any price savings"
5,Rarely give a 5 but truthfully We set out to go to Giuseppes and stopped herethought we were thereIm sure Giu is good but Arrivederci is the bomb We will keep going on every visit Reasonable and really really authentic Bueno Sera is your welcomeand they mean it We loved it   reasonable too b
5,"The pool area was very nice  Every chair had a towel on it ready for you  The pool service was great  Greg Badger is the most hardworking waiter there  He was out in the sun in upper 90lower 100 degree temperatures and was very helpful to all the guests  I ate at Elements the other times I visited Arizona but the poolside menu is great too I preferred the orange chicken bento box  Although edamame was not on the poolside menu our waiter was able to get it for us  That is great service

The bed was very comfortable nice and soft  I also liked the wallmounted flatscreen LCD tvThe valet service was great as well  We were greeted everytime we drove into the Sanctuary complex  

The tennis courts were very nice as well  I played during the morning and made use of their ball machine to warm up"
5,We recently moved nearby Pho Ao Sen and dine there often I love their food the service and also the atmosphere My favorites are the bun dishes I always order the no 26 with chicken instead of pork and they have a delicious vegetarian lemongrass beef vermicelli that I would highly recommend Pho Ao Sen is a great place to dine with friends mine have always enjoyed the experience
1,"Read al lthe hype so decided to give Cyclo a try  What a disappointment  Portions were small and overpriced owner thinks shes the next best thing to sliced bread  She needs to go back to Vietnam to remember how real Vietnamese food is prepared

Give this place a miss"
5,"I was in Phoenix for three weeks on a business trip and luckily found this spot on my 3rd day in town  I ended up eating here 7 times in 21 days  I brought my coworkers here and they all ended up eating here at least 23 times  Its just that good

So how good is it  Lets just say that their tortilla soup was the only thing that could cure my horrible hangover after a long night in Scottsdale

Ive eaten the fish tacos fajitas enchiladas nachos and tortilla soup  All were exceptional  They also bring out chips with salsa as well as beans which was a nice touch

The dining area is fairly small but they do have an outside dining area as well  The wait staff is very friendly and they will get you drinks as soon as you sit down which is something that more restaurants should do  The food comes out very quickly and they do have 2 TVs one on either side of the dining room which are usually tuned to a sporting event

Ive been out of Phoenix for 3 months now and I miss Mi Pueblo  Ill definitely be going back the next time that Im in Phoenix"
5,"Ok so us 5 hot chix got all dolled up for dinner at City Hall it was about 7 when we arrived on Saturday The service was top notch from the get go starting with the valet We were seated by a pleasant hostess in the large main room Our waiter was an entertaining gentleman thats one huge plus I have to say about Mastros is they usually have seasoned wait staff they really know their product

They brought us the great basket of warm breads we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some 06 Sauv Blanc that was mighty tasty It was impossible to have an empty glass this night

Everyone had fillets but me of course I mainly had apps sides wine and desert  I did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok I wasnt too impressed with it though Beefsteak tomato  mozz see pics very yummy The creamed corn sauteed asparagus and mash were all very good I couldnt talk anyone into the lobster mash or any caviar boohoo me   Everyone loved their meal

My gf was coming back from the bathroom and missed a step or something somehow she lost her shoe but there was a busser or someone right behind her he picked it up for her and even put it back on for her Now that is what I call 5 Star Service

We had creme brle they served it with various fresh berries and a huge bowl of their fresh made whip cream yumgasms were had all around While Mastros is not my top choice since I am not a Steakhouse kinda girl it was all good stuff They always play some  Michael Bubl and who doesnt just love him It was about 3 bills total and we went home with doggy bags and full tummys

PS  I had their sweet potato fries they were good but I like the ones at Fez betterjust sayin Oo"
5,I love this place My girlfriend and I go here to celebrate special occasions and the staff is so friendly We sat at the bar last time and the bartender Jesse was so great The happy hour menu was amazing too 5 Mark West Pinot Noir The manager was super friendly and came over to make sure we were doing okay Great experience Definitely recommend the calamari too
5,"I can only vouch for the chicken salad as its the only thing Ive ever tried in the 20 years Ive been coming here Its THAT good I always think about trying something else but why mess with perfection

Walking inside gives you the sense that youve stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70s I personally find it to be awesome Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare And yes the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards Besides whatever money theyre not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad"
5,I would order silvermine over Jimmy Johns ANY DAY They have the best meatball subcompared to Jimmy Johns it is GOLDEN never mind the fact that JJs doesnt have hot subs They are always fast to deliver and the food is always great My go to sandwich shop  MUCH LOVE TO SM
5,"Put it in the baby book  Babys first AJs  And youll always have a special soft place in your heart for your first  

I love that while this location is in a nice part of town its not quite the same level of froufrou as many other spots  That means rather than dealing with the Scottsdale types who have to dress up to go to the store  youre dealing with a greater range of folks  but they are all willing to pay a bit more for the good stuff  I will say youll pay less for a box of cereal or box of triscuits at a Circle K than you will at an AJs And I dont think Ive ever seen anything on sale  

But there is just nothing like their fresh food  Be it produce or the meat section the colors are brighter the items are bigger and you just know its going to taste better  Their chicken breasts and pork chops are so amazingly good and so large you want to eat them all at once but you just cant  You have to try some of their preprepped meats  My fav is a pork loin with apple stuffing  Wow 

And of course great premade foods too if you just want to pick up something to go  Ive been suckered in to their desert section far too many times  And they are always good  But dang they can be pricy  so it really has to just be a special splurge  

If you havent tried an AJs yet I suggest this one to ease you into things   There may be quite a few Lexus in the parking lot but there wont be too many Hummers"
5,"Thanks to everyone who put up with all the closed roads and driving detours yesterday for the marathon  As one of the largest marathons in the country it was really cool to see all the spectators volunteers and bands supporting and encouraging the 34000 runners I finished the half marathon yesterday and the war wounds arent nearly as bad but I am sore as hell still 

It became clear at the startline  that we really have to do something about the Capitol complex That area is a disaster  Thanks for all the carbheavy food and drink at the start and finish  I have never enjoyed spilling hot coffee all over myself up until yesterday morning Thanks to the UPS drivers who hauled our stuff to the finish

The halfmarathon doesnt run through the most attractive parts of Phoenix but McDowell Road is definitely a step up from Van Buren  Thats for sure Could you imagine thousands of runners trying to dodge hookers on their way to the finish line

And also thanks to the guys in my running corral who dressed up and ran as the Super Mario Bros Mario and Luigi  You guys rock"
5,"I have been going to Cartel for a while and their coffee has absolutely spoiled me I can hardly drink coffee or esspresso from anywhere else I even buy their beans and brew it at home
Most of the bartistas are stellar but expect to wait for your specialty drinks not only because they are almost always busy but also because making kick ass coffee drinks takes time
I suggest either the Honduras with cream an iced agave latter or a cappuccino which you have to drink there"
1,"So theres no negative stars too bad Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it  good thing you couldnt pay me to eat here

The only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price 10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings Whered they get their chef Chilis What a disappointment All the reviews say  a lot of food for who an infant

I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well Didnt know deep fried greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called cookies Good grief the bakery wasnt even good Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling 

The only good thing about Chandler Chompies is Jasons Deli right next door"
1,"I am totally baffled why this place gets such good reviews I have been there a few times because its close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday Unfortunately after the last experience I cant go back  Although they are very nice and have great prices I have to reveal the ugly truth 
1 They dont put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done not spray soap nothing
2 Reason 1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed  I had to use peroxide neosprin and bandages for almost a week to get it heal 
3 They water down their nail polish so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries 
I hate to bash a business with good customer service but these practices are simply unacceptable  I obviously wont be back "
5,If you want a deal for your buck this is the place to go Youll find Dewalt Makita Oster Cuisinart Farberware Keurig and many other banded items for a fraction of the original retail price Yes some items will be out the package missing a manual or may have a scratch or a dent but I rather pay a fraction of the price versus paying full retail at a department store I rather save money and get a ridiculous deal for the same exact item I would have paid 10X more at a well organized and clean shop From what I know this store has been open for nearly ten years the owners are one of the nicest people Ive met they even offer free delivery with the furniture or any other large item you purchase Stop by Youll get a kick from just walking down the unorganized messy aisles but once you get to the register to pay youll be happy Get more for less
5,"Hip hop sandwich shop  Not a traditional dining experience  Food was great and prices were very great  Everything on menu was under 10  Mac and Cheese is worth ordering as an appetizer and the BLT was rediculously delicious 

I look forward to going back again and probably again"
5,"Had the best BEST time here tonight My mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and I insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me Ive never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in 

The restaurant is beautiful we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice The bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it ala the Ocean Club bar We has 2 rounds including the Vitamin C martini White Chocolate Martini Flirtini and Black Cherry cocktail they were all really great We also got the colossal shrimp appetizer which technically werent all that colossal they were just normal the sliders the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing and the AZ Eggrolls a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour The tab was only 65 it was happy hour and the prices averaged about 6 drink and app The service was also extremely good 

Its been a long time since I felt like raving about a restaurant it was great"
5,Love it here  Always unique and slightly dark art  Definitely a go see if you are in phoenix
5,I never knew this movie theater existed I mean I dont frequent paradise valley mall that often and when I go I have tunnel vision as I go straight to the stores I need to go to and get the heck out of there So when Travelzoo had their movie special  two tickets 1 large popcorn and two large drinks for 15 I couldnt pass it up The theater is small but very quaint The seats are EXTREMELY comfortable and they kinda recline How cool is that Plus the best part the staff are super duper friendly A huge win in my book I will definitely be going back to this cute little hidden gem of a theater
5,UMMMMMMMMcan I just say that this place needs to get more action  The pizzas here are FANTASTIC  I discovered this place because it opened above SACKS  It is around the corner from my house and I am so thankful it is  The whole restaurant is openI wish it had a little more space but that is ok  First the Tuscan Pie is to die for  It has prosciutto Gorgonzola apple arugula a fig marmalade and balsalmic vingerette reduction sauce drizzled on topat least I think that is what it isI need to check the menubut anyways its FABULOUS  I wish I could eat it everyday  I tried their Moroccan Pizza before they took it off the menu and it was awesome too  Every single salad is great and the wine and beer selection is great too  The staff is so nice and friendly  I get this to go all the time and bring it homeand I have shared this with my friends too  I love good Italian pizza and its great
5,I love this place they do the best job I even drive 45 min because I moved and they are worth it Im always happy with the results My nails dont lift or chip I have also had a facial their and it was amazing It was my first facial however I was happy and it wasnt expensive I would recommend this place to anyone Just bring cash for your tip they do take cards but not for tips
1,"My sister recently took her 98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale AZ for an overheating issue  Im normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was 600 miles away  She described the symptoms as follows overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason  Since I wasnt around to look at it she took it to First Class Auto

She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality

They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine20L 8V 4 cyl AEG code  Well a I personally replaced the timing belt water pump and serpentine belt about 10000 miles ago as preventative maintenance  Whats more is the car hasnt lost any coolant since the job  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely  I did not replace the thermostat though  Once she called me to tell me this I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out

I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans  I turned on the AC and the fans didnt come on at all  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse  Guess what that fuse is for  The RADIATOR FANS  Imagine that  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt  The coolant level was exactly at the max level right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10000 miles ago not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale didnt have to add anything  The car doesnt leak a drop of coolant

Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly  The larger strip fuses were still decent  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well so thats definitely not a problem  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like theyre supposed to  Problem solved

I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explaindefend themselves but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didnt recognize and no one at the counter  What great customer service

So she COULD have spent the quoted 800 and STILL had the same problem  She just got dinged for a 40 diagnostic fee for an incorrect diagnosis"
5,I absolutely love this sub shop Its the only place i will get a sub sandwich I have been going here for over 10 years and i NEVER get tired of it Mitch is an awesome owner and he really cares about the customer MUST GO
5,"Im one of those people that loves frozen yogurt  Anything that taste this great and is this guiltfree will get me every time  The Golden Spoon has a variety of flavors of froyo and each delicious flavor is only 88 calories per 4 ounces  This is good news my friends

On top of that the price is very reasonable  I got the mini which is 4 ounces and it rang up to 214  When I compare it to Desert Swirl your other choice of froyo on the Westside this is extraordinarily more affordable

The service was not overly friendly but just fine  The ice cream chick was happy to give us some samples

I highly recommend the Heath flavored froyo  Delicious"
1,After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else They also did a poor job I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them Dont waste your time here
5,"We saw a small door with a sign over it and were intrigued so we went inside  thats how we found Kazimierz  Once our eyes adjusted its dark inside like any good speakeasy I loved the decor  Its a wine bar with food that seems to be Egyptian flatbreads and then whatever the chef wants to make  We were there on a Saturday right in the middle of happy hour and enjoyed a ridiculous evening of items that were mostly 8  Wine flights flatbreads certain bottles of wine  8  BOTTLES OF WINE  Im sure they were just cleaning out old inventory since they have hundreds of listings but for these two wines until they ran out of bottles the bottles were 8  

We had the Northern Territory flatbread pancetta yukon gold potatoes rosemary crème fraîche and smoked gouda Yum We also had an open faced sandwich made with smoked pork belly apple butter and melted cheese with sweet potato chips on the side  IT WAS 7  Between the 8 bottle of wine and that I felt like I was stealing from these people 

The bartenders were great as so was the music  I will without question be going back"
5,This place is a lil bit of awesomeness The food was great the service was awesome and the atmosphere was very nice Whats not to like about a great steakhouse that serves great food and provides awesome service
5,They do a great job My old dry cleaner was always destroying buttons on my shirts Never happens at Titan Friendly staff too Also good place to have alterations  shoe repairs next doorin the back of a barber shop
5,We have had nothing but good luck at this franchise so far Weve been here probably a dozen times Its always clean and the food is fresh and the way it ought to be Yum
5,Was at Zinc again last night and have to say the place keeps getting better still  Started with the crepes again perfect again  Then shared the scallops and lamb shank for dinner  Im not usually a huge fan of lamb OR scallops but they were recommended and I was feeling adventurous  The lamb   AMAZING  Melt in your mouth wonderful  More like a stew than anything with classic fall off the bone tender meat over creamy cheesy polenta  Their bread is perfect French bread too  This time of year winter there is a festive buzzy energy with a good crowd but not TOO long of a wait  Make reservations though for sure  Oh and Bobbys across the way in Kierland is a nice spot for a predinner drink 400s Hollywood glamour meets The Jetsons with cool live jazz your parents or grandparents would have enjoyed back in the day
5,"Baiz Market is a Mediterranean type restaurant or Arabic type food Well you could get confused and call it that The fact of the matter is though that this place has a very unique touch This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries but also its food The owner is persian so you can tell where the tastes are coming from Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix but thats ok once you are there you will be glad you found it

This place is unique because they make their own bread Are you kidding me I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago and Ive been living in Phoenix for 20 years The chicken and beef shawarma have a special authentic taste because of the fresh bread One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste but the pricing is very fair as well I dont think I can stress this enough but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area Why havent the other restaurants caught on I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread but their pricing makes them a different story Im talking about The Persian Room in Scottsdale

I just dont understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away Good bread and Arabic bread are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives but they just dont taste fresh

If you like the bread head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread its baked throughout the day I think I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation Beware though the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days so you really need to use it quickly This isnt bad its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita

I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma but I decided Id get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus The beef kabob plate came with hummus bread 2 skewers of beef kabob and some pickles and onions Wow The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly and were EXTREMELY tender It was a tad bit on the lemony side but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender Perhaps some of the best persian kabobs I have ever had The hummus was definitely good as well I cant stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus

I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma and rightly so If youre weary of persian food just check this place out Its not expensive at all food for two is like 15 The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting"
5,The single best ribs Ive ever had at any restaurant  This place is brand new and off to a great start  The mac and cheese was delicious the bone marrow was great as usual and the staff and chef were friendly and helpful  Ill be back here
5,"Yum yum yum Mexican food has to me my favorite type of food and Arriba is for sure at the top of my list for Mexican restaurants This is a New Mexican style restaurant with lots of hatch green chilies in their dishes You can also buy them fresh from here by the pound during the month of August 

I have eaten here probably 30 times and they are always consistent The chips are always fresh and warm  they serve two different salsas as well as bean dip All three are the bomb My favorite item on the menu is the whitesands chimichanga Do not order this though if you cant handle spicy stuff but if you are like me the spicier the better then go with this 

Everyday they have good lunch specials I like to go on Thurs because they have chimis for 199 For an extra dollar they will smother it with the white sands sauce What a deal And on Sunday they have kids day with a clown that makes animal balloons And best of all kids eat free 

And if your a beer drinker they have a microbrewery too Im not a beer drinker though so I cant tell you how good it is But the margaritas are on point"
5,"LOVE the Four Peaks Can get crowded as hell and parking is a bit of a cluster F but Ive never ever not had a fun night there  The beer is excellent the service has always been attentive and the food is above normal bar standards

The fish and battered fries was very good the tartar sauce is good but ask for the cocktail sauce    its fantastic  Heavy on the horseradish enough to feel it in your nose  And the Rueben might just be the best in town

The happy hour is great  3 locally brewed pints  Sign me up

The location and the it being an actual brewery gives it extra points  I had family in town this week and I like to take out of towners to places that have a local AZ vibe  They definitely got a taste of MY Arizona  Next time theyll have to come during Pumpkin Porter season"
5,"A burger With anything I want FINEIll do it

I need no convincing for a burger fries and a coke Thanks Carls Jr 

Earleir this afternoon after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat And eat well

I stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall Not sure how long its been open Perhaps it was the grand opening

It was PACKED But I digress

As soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall youll realize that this is not your typical burger joint They have their own seating separate from the mallcommoners And their own bathrooms CLEAN

You get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating

Ordering your burger isnt a gong show Fairly easy All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE

My food was delicious Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings onions tomatoes etc 

The fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school when I held a girls hand for the first time Soft perfect and lovely Thats how these fries felt Ok that sounded weird Tough

Oh I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO EFFING AWESOME I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER 

Im really hoping this Kanye yelping phase ends soon since my reviews make me seem like a bigger Jackass than I seem in person

Ultimately I left this place happy satisfied and I will come back again

Ohthe answer to the one question in everyones mind YES BETTER THAN INNOUT"
5,Came here with the hubs and we love the place   We were able to eat here for significantly less dinero than you typically spend at any other sushi restaurant  The food comes by on the conveyer belts and the items are price coded by the color plate they are on  At the end of your meal you just add up the plates for your total  Each plate comes with 46 pieces of sushi and they also have salads desserts appetizers etc on the belt  If you are afraid that the sushi has been on the belt for too long or there is something else that you would like that isnt currently on display you can order direct from the bar  Win win 
5,"On top of how good the food is their customer service is excellent I went to eat there on Thursday the 16th and had the best server ever He was the bartender as well and still payed tons of attention to my table He was very nice and very helpful He had extensive knowledge of the menu He was also very personable He laid out samples of their various barbeque sauces while giving some details about each one He squirted them out onto an extra plate he brought to the table and he made the shape of a smiley face with all the sauces He made that dining experience so good that I wish I could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise I couldnt hear him when he stated his name over a large group that had just come in and was moving tables but he was wonderful
  Also one of the people with me is from the east coast and likes vinegarbased barbeque sauce They didnt have any of that kind in their current rotation of sauces and he actually went back to the kitchen and explained the situation A lady from the kitchen made a vinegarbased barbeque sauce from scratch just because one of us had mentioned how much we loved it
   Ive never experienced service like that and really cant say enough about how great this guy and all other staff I came into contact with was Great job to whoever hired him
  The food was delicious I love their fries Unlike anything you can get anywhere else I got the country roasted chicken great seasoning super moist and tender while still having that chargrilledroasted skin my favorite All of their sauces are so good its hard to choose just one And no matter how many times I go there I always sample each one again
  All positive things to say about this Famous Daves
Oh and I forgot to mention the corn muffinsbeyond words Seriously you have to try them Now Im craving one and Im pretty sure theyre not open at 300 am I wish I could order them by the dozen haha"
5,"I called several pool service companies before choosing Desert Gator Pool Service  

When we bought our house I insisted to my husband that we could take care of the poolall we needed was someone to come check the chemicals once a month  Oh sure  After about one week mustard algae a bad storm and a cranky pool pump we were looking for a pool guy

We called them on a Saturday and the owner of Desert Gator was kind enough to come to our home at 600am the following Monday to fit with our schedules  We had our service set up that week and have been very happy ever since  

They definitely got our pool under control and taught us quite a bit along the way  We still have them coming once every week  its so worth it  Our pool was in bad shape after a recent storm and they were incredibly responsive  I think they came two or three times that week without charging us more

85 per monthbut can be a bit more if you need parts and chemicals"
1,Im sad to report that we dined here for lunch and it was inedible  Chef Aaron please come by and monitor your staff  We had the eggplant sandwich and is was a disaster  It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate  The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality  The beer menu looked fabulous  So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be finebut if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied  We hope this turns around  The decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpfuland we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the hood
5,"Good rates
Great location near food shopping
Quiet area
Rooms have kitchens
Free Wifi and Breakfast

For a business traveler these are the big selling points its kinda basic but loads of features"
5,Doc and Edwards has been a place of refuge for 5 years for me  Hell most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there  It is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home  It is so comfortable and wide open  Even on the most crowded days I feel like I am on the cast of cheers  The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect  You can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge  The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks they waive the pool table fee Or you could go for some ping pong foosball UFC or big buck hunting  It has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist I have ever heard If my girl would only let me I would have my wedding there
5,Great gluten free Italian place Tell all you gluten free friends they will love you for it
5,"I cant believe some of the things Ive been seeing people NAG about in their reviews for this new restaurant I set my standards pretty high for Rice Paper and they did not disappoint 

I took my wife on a date here last night because she really loves beef pho and had been waiting for this place to open up The atmosphere was very bright and welcoming as well was our server He sat down with us and quickly went over what was good and what was popular with most patrons so far We took him up on a few of his suggestions and started with the fried calamari Im not sure what they bread it with but it was delicious and the squid was perfect not too soft not too chewy

For our main course I ordered the Shaking Beef which was cubed filet mignon served over onions on a sizzling platter in a special sauce with a side of rice and grilled zuchinni again on the suggestion of my server I HIGHLY RECOMMEND My wife got the beef pho at first I was a bit iffy on it because the broth looked very clear as if it were going to be somewhat watery but it was VERY well seasoned Our server told us that the broth stews for at least 12 hours allowing it to achieve the best flavor from the pho spices VERY IMPRESSED 

Yes it is much pricier than your average pho joint but Id rather pay a bit extra for a nice clean and slightly upscale atmosphere And the quality of the food is MUCH higher than the mystery meat youll get in your bowl of pho at some other places 

Well done Rice Paper we WILL be back"
5,"This is by far the best farmers market Ive been to in the Valley  Still small by comparison to LA and the Bay Area but is off to a great start with lots of potential and space to grow into

McClendon has a great spread of high quality mainly organic produce and is constantly restocking so its ok if you dont get there first thing  It was exciting to see beautiful Tuscan kale and broccoli rabe at prices lower than Sprouts  Meyer lemons and blood oranges were also available

Phoenicians outstanding loaves were only 3 Youre welcome to sample  we particularly liked the Olive Walnut and Dark Chocolate Cherry

We enjoyed Digestifs Frittata 4 made with thin layers of potato eggs pork belly and spinach  Other combinations available were Dandelion with Goat Cheese and Mushrooms with Garlic Confit Executive Chef Payton Curry is also there to demonstrate pulling fresh mozzarella which is served with a variety of sauces and toppings

It was fun walking around this bustling market sampling food like tamales which we intend to come back for next week  If I can get myself out of bed at a decent hour on Sat Ill be here for sure every week until the season ends in May"
1,UNBELIEVABLE  so enraged and appalled  i took my 91 yr old mom in to the salon for a manipedi  after the pedicure she had the manicure and she asked for french tips  the GIRL claims she asked mom if she wanted gel nails  shes 91 did not understand the gals english and cant hear so i presume she nodded  after mom paid the charge of 60 and i picked her up i had another appt  she told me about the charge and said she had never paid that much for a manipedi  i called and was told the normal charge is 30 w5 added for french and HE said to come back cause it was mistake  we did and the whole group of technicians said it was moms fault for saying yes and would not concede AT ALL  not in the slightest  i found that to be awful and mom felt very taken advantage of  i will NEVER return there and i caution any hearingimpaired customers to not use this business  TO ME and of course to mom it was such a slam on the elderly mom is a visitor from the east coast and at her age does not need to be treated that way  VERY BAD BUSINESS
5,Been here 4 times in the past 6 months  I love bringing outoftowners here  Excellent art and history exhibits specifically related to Native Americans from the southwestern United States  Reasonably priced entrance fee  Go on the tour  they will tell you really interesting things about each of the exhibits you otherwise wouldnt know  makes the visit much more enjoyable  A must see for visitors to Phoenix
1,As you walk in you are greeted by a sign that says Cash Only ATM inside alright times are tough I get it  Then you see the special board which read Good Food Takes Time and there is a clock next to that  Fine thats cool but the problem is that after waiting for our good food it came out and was awful  My wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store  30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away  The good news is that we went around the corner to the Breakfast Club and had an excellent meal
5,"This review is for the food only  If you care about parking and what kind of extras they sell that arent food related youll have to check out another review

I love LGO  The food is absolutely top notch and I love how the menu has both traditional fare and a few things youve never heard of like their Venice Beach Burrito which is filled with scrambled eggs tofu chorizo spinach and other goodies  It comes with a side of salsa which also fantastic  I eat breakfast here all the time and I have never been disappointed  Also if youre in a hurry grab one of their premade granolayogurtfruit parfaits Yum"
5,What a great little find especially for Phoenix  Ive been there on at least 4 occasions and have never been disappointed and just had to let everybody know about this little gem  Recently  I took my mother and we had delicious Singapore Noodles and Malaysian Rice Noodles which are kind of like Thais Rad Na but better  On another occasion my husband ordered Pork Belly Curry and really loved it  I wasnt as adventurous and had delicious Chicken Kebab Burmese style  Family owned quiet and very affordable  You have to really look for this place since its in a shopping centerits on the north side of Shea between 70th  71st St in Scottsdale Great early bird dinners as well
1,"Absolutely gross  Im just going to be bluntly honest who the F cares what the food tastes like when the place looks like a frickin dump  It was so disgustingly dirty inside Besides food paper trash resting among the carpet the tables were dirty the bathroom was out of service and I feared touching anything as I was led to my seat thats a problem

Ive actually never seen such a messy restaurant before Let me also say that the restaurant was empty when we arrived and was filthy when we walked in and was filthy when we left 

Obviously no one that works at this restaurant cares about cleaning up between seatings Theres no excuse for a place to be disgusting like this Its downright unsanitary You serve food Valle Luna youre a business Valle Luna keep the place clean for heavens sake"
5,I was in this area and went here for lunch today based on the Yelp reviews I had a molete and lengua fish and pastor tacos Washed it all down with a Mexican coke made an awesome lunch Everything was so good I ordered a shrimp burrito to go and shared it with a friend after I left Ill be back to try more things next time Im in the area
5,I love me some coffee The french roast brew is perfect for surviving a long day of work If you want something sweet order the iced raspberry mocha Just the right amount of sweetness without tasting like youre drinking syrup The muffins are moist and delicious The spinach salad here is surprisingly amazing yes they make spinach salad at this coffee place The best part about this place It is not full of hipsters and college students who hog all the decent seating and never leave I cant wait to go back to try all of the other drinks offered
5,"It isnt often enough that I get to dine at Carlsbad but last night I decided to have dinner there Ill be completely honest service is always a mixed bag But then you figure when theyre crammed to the gills which is generally how it goes you cant always expect Speedy freaking Gonzales to be your server However last night I dont think I could have sneezed between the time I ordered my food and when it arrived to my table Excellent is all I can say about this joint

If youre looking for some tasty New Mexican fare get over there And if its packed let the valet park your carCUZ ITS FREE Start off with a Dos Equis Amber get some nachosthis vegetarian WILL eat the niblets of chicken in them nachos cuz its just that tasty and kick back Preferably on the patiobecause theres a waterfall 

And if Jacobs working the bar expect nothing but the best in cocktails seriously"
1,This wendys is terrible I grew up going to Wendys but recently the whole chain has become disgusting This one is just a slow disgusting chain Blah rather eat pretty much any where else
5,"FANTASTIC little lunchbrunch spot Went here with the family while visiting Scottsdale and really enjoyed it 

We had the Tuna Melt which was delicious with their spiked cottage cheese 
The cranberry chicken salad made into a sandwich was DELICIOUS 

The omelets and scrambles looks great  I didnt taste but then again there was nothing left on the plate LOL 

Smaller place so could be busy during peak hours may call or try and hit an off time Service was ok wasnt anything special but the food was really cute and made for a really cute little lunch spot"
1,They wouldnt honor pet cos online sale prices  Thats the first time Ive heard about this
5,"Arai pastry is so delicious
ironically i come here not for the sweeties confections cakes cookies cremes not being my style but for their delicious savory treats The breads they make here are top knotch the various salty pastries are all worth exploring the red bean one and the curry filled ones being my favorites But the real deal the Coup de grâce the mamoth reason of what makes this little japanese pastry shop in my mind is their sandwhiches green tea shakes
that powerful one two punch of savory sagacity is what makes me want to live sometimes
yes yes
i find the world to be a better place with those items in my tummy"
5,I ADORE this place Matts has been a staple breakfast brunch whatever place for me since I moved to Downtown 5 years ago They just moved to a great place up the street where Verde used to be for locals with more room so now everything isnt so crammed Not that we all didnt enjoy their original house this one just says Im still awesome I just stepped up a notch Everything is delicious I love their 5 Spot the waffles are great and their lunch specials are always amazing If you like jelly  try their homemade stuff Try the bacon
5,"What can I say that hasnt already been said about the food or the view I know Ill share the best part about my amazing birthday dinner at Elements  meeting Executive Chef Beau Macmillian 

He didnt duck away when we made eye contact in the hallway instead he broke away from his staff and came right up and introduced himself He was so incredibly personable He could have easily ignored us Im sure hes approached on a regular basis now that hes such a TV personality But instead he chatted us up and he talked about how he was so inspired by Asian food and how he wanted to bring that influence into his food and to Arizona Before we knew it he was taking us in to see the latest renovations to Elements kitchen 

He proudly showed off the latest upgrades Sure there were new gadgets but he even included skylights because his sous chefs said they hated never seeing the light of day How cool is that

And to be revealed next month is an expansion to the kitchen that includes a table for 12 INSIDE the kitchen Not a new concept for restaurants but something Chef Macmillian is so excited about Theres no doubt that the food that he cranks out can be intimidating but his latest endeavor speaks to his desire of having his guests witness the artistry behind the kitchen doors This new addition promises to give you a full sensory experience BEFORE the plate even reaches your table   from seeing smelling and hearing whats happening in the kitchen to finally tasting the finished product Talk about mouth watering    

Heres hoping that I will one day get to sit at that table"
5,I love the lakes  Yes its a lake in the desert  Dragon Boat Outrigger and Marathons  Its the place to do it  Not sure about the fishing part but I do see people fishing there  What are they trying to catch hmmm  I enjoy running there on a nightly basis and so should you  South side is probably the most scenic but not to say the North side is bad  If youre a fellow photographer I would definitely recommend this place during the evenings 
1,"I would give this place NO STARS but Yelp wants me to give at least one 

I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo Scottsdale experience I have to say this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences The service was so bad we didnt even get to try the food 

True Yelper that I am I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner I saw all the reviews about the bad service  but I paid more attention to the Cheap and  Delicious Pho reviews because after all you cant knock it til youve tried it Yes the place looks as divey as any food dive gets yes the place isnt as clean as it probably can be but hey all the best pho Ive  had Da Vang Khai Hoan Pho Thanh has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town  I was excited 

It was around 6pm and the place wasnt busy there were 5 other customers besides us and 3 of them were on their way out so we went ahead and sat ourselves down The server gave us menus and made her way back behind the cash register 

After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes I usually go for the spring rolls  everything pho whenever I visit a new spot we were ready to order I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the preteen sitting behind the counter with her I finally made eye contact with her she looked at me and I looked at her and she turned back to her conversation For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order  no luck But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more I wasnt about to give up because I was determined to try some of their wellreviewed food but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us my boyfriend and I had enough The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant 

We are never going back to this restaurant and I suggest you dont either Just as it isnt acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff it also isnt okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review I dont care how delicious and cheap your food is you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals 

Thanks but no thanks Pho House I dont need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food I have plenty of Vietnamese friends who have moms who can probably cook better than you can and will treat us a million times better than your staff did last night"
5,"Okaytalk about coincidences
The other day I was complichatting with fellow yelper Jarvis about hard to find music
Today I run into a past acquaintence while out and about
How do either of these tie into a review of Boom Boom La Rues
Okayfollow along if you will
So I run into this past acquaintence whos apparently had a bit of a rough weekShe tells me about finding this store in the middle of a bad day and it immediately turned her frown upside down
Shes raving about itThen she tells me she has a yelp account and has added a review
I tell her I too have some reviews on yelp
Today Im in that neck of the woods and so I stop in
Holy hell
This place is a drag queens delight
Its insanely glitterific and there are beaded dresses and sequined accessories everywhere
Not anything I can personally do anything withbut I did manage to pick up a few things as gifts for friends
And none of it broke the bank
What does this have to do with my convo with Jarvis
A day or so ago we were discussing hard to find music and I brought up Nina Hagen
The sales girl in this store was a DEAD RINGER for Nina Hagen
Flame red spikey hair and clothes right out of 1978 pure punk rock
That took me back to the good old days for sure
She knew the stockwas able to make excellent suggestions by asking specific questions and wasnt the least bit pushy
She was able to attend to  several customers at the same time and created a very social atmosphere for everyone there
For someplace I didnt expect to feel comfortable init was a pleasant surprise
While there wasnt anything there I would feel the need to buy for myselfI could see going back again and again to get gifts for friends
A great experience"
5,We took our grandson Sebastian to the park for a thoroughly enjoyable visit  Sebastian wasnt too sure about the carousel but the train ride put a smile all over his face  The visit to the Presidential railroad car was fun and educational for the adults  Sebastian liked it too
5,"So After 8 years of owning a Ford it left me stranded on the road one to many times 

So I bought a 06 Hyundai Elentra from a different location Ive never owned a foreign car this car appealed to me because of the low miles and still had a warranty 

Wellit started to act a little funny So I called up Discover Hyundai as they are miles from my work I spoke to Tim in the service department and he was more then helpful 

They had to keep the car for 2 days because they couldnt get it to do what I was telling them it was doingbut they were persistent and finally were able to duplicate my issue 

Everything was under my warranty I was back on the road by the end of day 2 

I will for sure be going back here for all normal maintenance and if any other issues arise Thanks Tim"
5,"I honestly wish I could give this place 0 stars just to keep people out of here thats how much of a gem my bf and I think this place is The not only have a more spacious theater a bar food beyond the typical nachos and sour patch kids crappy but its there and basically just a bonus in my opinion but they have 3 flavors of popcorn3 Holy bajesus we go for the Carmel popcorn alone I dont even think we have had the regular or the cheese ever maybe once We go out of our way to go there just for that This place is never that busy which I dont understand Oh and another plus its not the Tweens hangout on Friday nights I will admit we buy the living social or grouping every time we go there 15 for 2 tix and 1 popcorn but they already have our business

You idiots who review a place after going to a highly publicized premier like the Hunger Games that you bought with a Groupon are just thatIDIOTS No one wants to listen to your nitpicking go to a useless site like Yahoo Local that no one reads so you dont have to make society dumber for listening to your complaining"
5,"My dad and I decided to try Great Wall because he had heard many reviews about the place and everyone insisted that you had to come try the Dim Sum  Since I was in town visiting it gave us the perfect excuse to go

Im happy to report that the experience was most excellent at Great Wall and that it lived up to the hype  Upon getting there we were given a number to wait as the restaurant was completely full there were probably 150 people there dining however we were seated within 15 minutes  As soon as we  sat down the carts started rolling by with various plates of items to try

The pancake shu mai shrimp duck and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended all were excellent  I did have a bit of trouble taking the shrimp out of the steam container because their rice wrappers were sticking a bit but that does happen

I would advise that if you have an allergy to shrimp that you make sure to ask the server what is in some of the items because they do come with shrimp including their egg rolls  Since my dad has a shrimp allergy we did have to watch for that  I did want to try their egg rolls but I would have been the only one eating them and they were big enough to make a meal in itself

The sliced duck was one of the best I have had at a restaurant well cooked with crispy tasty skin and not too many bones to get in the way and very reasonably priced at 625 for a plate  Most other Dim Sum plates are 225 or 315 so you can end up eating a lot for a very reasonable price

If you love Dim Sum and are willing to wait a few minutes for a table but you will get fast service afterward this really is the place you want to go to  There are still so many more dishes to try as well but that will be for another trip"
5,Carlsbad Tavern is my favorite Mexican restaurant I love the dark and cozy atmosphere inside and I love that they have Hoegaarden on tap Ive had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing They serve New Mexico cuisine here The only difference I noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans I have a lot of friends from New Mexico and they all love this restaurant The food here is delicious and flavorful if you dont live in the neighborhood its definitely worth the drive
5,Very consistent food Definitely a second best to PF Changs
5,My wife and i just dined at this restaurant I am a chef and must say that Chef Chriss concept is one I have not experiencedThe food was outstanding service excellent and the decore was creativedown to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on  Our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice  What really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course Being a chef I had to share a neat appetizer that i recently found using a baby corn shoot  Chef keep up the suberb Cafe Monarch Bravo
5,I am very particular about where I go for sushi  I can name ten places I will not go to and have struggled to find a place to frequent until now  I have only been here about 5 times but every time was a great experience  Great food staff pricesand atmosphere
5,"My trip was inspired by Adam Richmonds visit and while I couldnt do the 12 slider challenge I knocked out 5 and was close to taking on a 6th

The GM stopped by to check on us and the waitress was great Be sure to grab some fresh baked deli treats before heading out"
5,"Wine booze and cigars And friendly staff Theres not much else that needs to be said Oh and great prices

The selection and prices they offer are great The aisles are wide and clearly marked The cigar room has a great selection as well and the prices are low"
5,"Any time I have out of town visitors who want real Mexican I take them here The chips are fresh the salsa is divine and after downing two baskets you realize you need to eat an entree Ive eaten a variety off the menu and nothing has disappointed me The burros are stuffed full the crisps are mouthwatering and the enchiladas melt in your mouth
The ONLY downside is the location Just not a great part of town though they are trying very hard to revitalize it Go there anyway Just try lunch time first"
1,"Okay did I say bad
WORSE
Negative five stars

From San Diego

5,I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii  Everytime I come home our first stop is Wongs  I love everything about it  Wongs is my comfort food
1,"An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me I planned my visit for a quieter evening and reviewed the menu again and again 

However upon our arrival I thought twice immediately The parking was iffy and the place didnt seem to stand up to the signage Perhaps the art was not to my liking honestly not a piece stands out in my memory 


We were seated immediately 

Our waiter seemed a little off not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen where he disappeared for 1015 minutes at a time He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is 

Halfway through waiting for our food which took 45 minutes easily the lamp above our table went out We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls 

When the food finally arrived we were too tired due to having finished an entire bottle of wine so we left Unfortunately we took our grub with us
I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce Its no coincidence youre taken aback by the combination it didnt go down too easily Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal though we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand 

Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right but since I am recommending that you not go there why bother"
5,"This is the ONLY place my wife and I will buy furniture from absolutely fantastic

My wife and I spent a better part of a month looking for a TV stand for our living room Everything we came across was cheap and prefabricated We stumbled on Sweet Potatoes while on our way home from another local store The owner was extremely friendly and helpful  We found a couple things we liked but not the size we needed  The owner told us the pieces we were looking at are locally made and offered to call and see if they could custom make one Not only did they agree but the price we were given was 200 dollars less than anything else we were looking at  We have since received the piece and could not be happier"
5,"My brother from San Francisco was in town and missing the sushi from the bay area I decided Id let him choose where wed go out even though Id never ever heard of this place before It was definitely in a notsoglamorous area tucked on the side of a dinky shopping center sorry shopping center When we walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the quaint atmosphere and setup Its definitely small but everyone working there and eating there seemed to be genuinely having a great time 

We sat at the barlong table in front of the sushi chefs which was a fun experience We started off with sake and it was pretty darn smooth We ordered a variety of different dishes including sea urchin eggs yellowtail shashimi and the king crab roll They were even accomodating to make my brother dishes that werent on the menu The chefs are so nice and fun and the prices are pretty good

My brother was extremely impressed coming from a top sushi city I look forward to coming back and trying more of their extensive menu especially for happy hour"
5,I love Taste Of China I eat here at least once a week Their menu is pretty big and the prices are small Also they are incredibly fast If order for pickup its ready in 5 minutes Should I order delivery it only takes 1015 for the food to get to my house My favorite plates are the crab puffs and the General Tsos chicken
5,Have been there several times Im quite fussy about where I eat and quick to condemn so my continued custom says it all
1,Youll feel like you stepped in a time machine and landed in 1987  The decor hasnt been updated in at least 20 years  Looks like its falling apart  The TVs are mostly 80s style TVs as well although there are a couple flat screens as well  This is where the trash hangs out of all colors  The pizza was greasy which I like but also chewy which was gross  The wings were drowned so much in sauce you couldnt find them  Might as well get a glass of honey bbq sauce and drink it straight  Service was interesting  The guy that worked there was wearing capri pants and had a higher voice than my girlfriend  The price wasnt bad I think it was like 22 for a large pizza wings and 2 sodas  Id rather pay a little bit more and just go to Upper Crust pIzza down the street
5,"First Im sorry this review is lengthy but i really want people to understand how far a little kindness can go 

I entered Mimis Cafe at the end of possibly worst day ever I came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out i waited not 15 seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named Danielle She gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before i looked at the menu for some time unable to clear my mind enough to decide She told me i was welcome to take a seat and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley wheres the fire take your time can i get you a glass of wine while you decide wine was a perfect idea I finally ordered and sat drinking my wine i waited and then waited a little longer Danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread  and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine When she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news Somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help It was just the olive branch i needed Just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion finally my food was ready She boxed everything with care for the drive home All this time smiling i couldnt help but notice Danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange She had brightened my day and it was clear she is a light for others in Mimis Cafe This is the kickermy bill was 30 and some changei gave her what i thought was two 20 dollar bills but in reality was a 50 and a 20 The young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir Im not sure these bills are right i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no i thought they were two 20s but the difference would be her reward for honesty The food was tasty and just what i needed Mimis Cafe is a friendly place worth the wait for food or a table and if Mimis Cafe reads these reviews know that you have a superstar in Danielle"
5,This is quite literally the best burger I have ever eaten The rocket bacon cheeseburger with 3 patties of meat on a 10 in sesame sub roll and is nothing short of amazing It could easily be shared The cheese fries and onion rings are homemade We love the casual environment and the huge selection of glass bottled soda To top it off the prices are amazing This is our first time here but we are hooked We would love to see this place on Diners DriveIns and Dives DDDinfomaccom so if you love it here nominate it
5,A real gem
1,Unprofessional disorganized and extremely low end care
1,"Should be called The Bad Egg Bottom line the hotels free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there 

We arrived around 945am on a Sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated The staff was pleasant enough We were seated given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special loaded potato skillet We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor Our food arrived about ten minutes after that The skillet was supposed to contain sausage bacon onion scrambled eggs grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream Mine had no bacon two tiny chunks of sausage no cheese and the potatoes were so soggy they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce The waitress never checked on us once during the meal She came back by the time my husband was finished I told her the meal was horrible in a nice way She offered me something else By that point I was not feeling like eating anything else I felt kinda sick My meal was comped and we did get an apology The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled The cook obviously didnt try my potatoes Blech Even with the comp the total was over 15 for one special and two coffees Very hight priced for nasty food poor service and louduninspiring atmosphere"
5,We went on a Friday night and even though it is off season here the place was packed Never the less the service was impeccable as always This is our third trip here and we have never been disappointed I had the 14 Oz NY strip and my wife had the prime rib Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned ever so  wonderfully My wife tells me the horseradish is the real deal and not the runny stuff you get elsewherecant vouch as I hate the stuff  From the bread to the desert every bite was worth taking The old time ambiance with the dark wood and red leather booths are welcoming Its pricey and if you can ignore the geek with khakis no socks and deck shoes ever so gently cradling his wineyou KNOW the guy and he is everywhere in the middle of a Phoenix summer it is worth every single cent
1,"So not following my own advice ahem NEVER RETURN I returned here for a friends birthday dinner a few months ago I super love this person so how could I say no HA Big mistake Also fair warning there are severalaCAPSLOCK ahead

The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group 15 people And of course because we were celebrating a super special person

Ill keep this update short and sweet

3 for a CAN OF SODA Get real I knew itd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something But a can COME ON You bought that in bulk and paid 03342 cents for it FAIL

Your servers IDIOTS First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders Then shes back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again Did you forget Were you not paying attention the first time we around Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them FORTYFIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD Very very bad 

Also not taking food orders until after weve been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD VERY VERY BAD Seated at 8 oclock we didnt receive our food until almost TEN OCLOCK TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY VERY BAD Do you hear that St Francis BAD

Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer and add on a 3 can soda Funny that our bill was still nearly 30 for the both of us Excluding tip BAD

Also server If you say youre not going to split a check stick to your word or dont even try Now IM glad you didnt stick to your stingy I dont split checks because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a 700 bill with 13 people I didnt know so well Lucky for us when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check you split it for us A couple others caught on and did the same but the remaining 78 people were not so lucky 

Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore or sweet for that matter Im ending it here NOTE TO SELF heed own advice and stay away from St Francis"
5,"SOOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN The 3 of us went to Superstition Farm for their tour last Saturday No we didnt have any kids with us but we may have had a better time than most of the kids

The beginning is a bit dry Youre in the classroom for a while learning about random facts related to diary cows  Moo  After that its a hay ride  Girls let me give you one tip  Make sure you wear long pants or shorts that are long  Hay is very uncomfortable under your butt if there isnt enough padding  Anyway the hay ride was entertaining but the best part had yet to come

Once the hayride was over the tour was officially over  But everyone stuck around to check out the petting zoo The animals were all so friendly and we got to feed them as well  There was a hodgepodge of creatures from a young cow to sheep to rabbits and even a turkey  Yumjust kidding

In addition theres a black lab on the premise that was amazing  This dog would make an incredible soccer player  His reaction time is unbelievable  any team would be happy to have him as a goalie

After the animal bonding we went to try flavored milk  Mine was butterscotch flavored and it was just ok  I was disappointed that the milk wasnt fresh from the farm but I guess its not legal to serve unprocessed milk  Since we had a Groupon we also had a chance to try Udder Delights ice cream At 250 each I would never pay for them individually But seeing that it was included in my deal we enjoyed them a lot

Dont be embarrassed if you dont have kids  Trust me adults can enjoy Superstition Farm too"
5,I love going to this store whether its for just for the latest copy of guitar world some strings or a new guitar the guy johnny is my main man lol he always gives me good deals and generally makes me and any one else i take there feel like we are the only customers in a good way every one remembers you and asks you how your day is going great mom and pop feel
5,"95 reviews Guess theres nothing I can say about this gem that hasnt been said We ordered the cheese pizza which is a really inexpensive but delicious tasting Margarita pizza sooo good 

We also had the vodka penne with tender big pieces of rendered bacon tomatoes and fresh basil The vodka sauce was creamy and seasoned very well They included a ton of grilled french bread and cutlery because they knew I was staying at a hotel They were really sweet and very fast at getting all that food ready for us 

It says on their website and on the yelp search engine that Pizza A Metro delivers but they dont Not a big deal though the food is totally worth going to get yourself"
5,"Love love love this place  Tasty with great prices who can beat that  My newest thing is to order a gyrotogo and enjoy it at home  Im a mom now so eating at a restaurant is a lot harder than it used to be haha

See ya there"
5,When I get the urge to eat out Im normally drawn to more laid back restaurants where I can sit back chat and enjoy my meal  With a relaxing atmosphere and fun menu Chicken  Waffles and Smores for dessert I definitely enjoyed this place  My first time here was for a Yelp event so I was able to try just about everything  My favorites would have to be the mac  cheese and the beef brisketboth delicious  Id say theyve got their BBQ technique mastered at least where the brisket is concerned  And the cornbread is probably the best Ive hadso happy they handed out the recipe at the event  The service was great everyone was friendly and very helpful  I was satisfied with everything here and definitely would come backand probably leave with tasty leftovers
5,"The place did not disappoint The moment we stepped through the archway my friends and I were bedazzled by the ambience throughout the area

 It really DOES feel like a tavern almost like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean Well kind of

But yeah the portions were overwhelming and best of all The food was spectacular I sat outside but honestly I think the place is pretty both ways so dont be too stingy on the location 

Jus go"
5,They get 5 stars for the only thing I have ever had there Every single time I have to get the Pizza Nortena It is out of this world It is meant to be an appetizer but we get it to go and have it for dinner
5,"This dude claims he steals souls for a living and is the best photographer In the world Ever  

httpwwwflickrcompeopletysoncrosbie

I promisethere is nothing at all vain hacky narcissistic overpriced or arrogant whatsosever about Tyson Crosby or his work

Phoenix should consider itself fortunate to be home to such a phenomenally overtalented artistic genius  Big art cities like NYC Chicago and LA would never be able to fully appreciate the photographic brilliance of the one the only the premier best photographer in the worldTyson Crosby

Humble poetic and unpretentious as he may be I cant argue with him The fist time I saw a Tyson Crosbie image I jzzed in my pants Really his work is that good For real No joke Im serious Totally serious  I love his work so much I want to marry a Tyson Crosby print

Where is the button for 5 million stars"
5,VegetarianVegan south Indian buffet  Guilt free conscience What more could a girl want I am in LOVE with the dosas  I always wish I had a larger tummy to accommodate all the delicious food Udupi is proof that being veganvegetarian can be tasty and crueltyfree Humble ambiance no fancy decorations
5,Wood fired pizzas scrumptious pasta dishes and bacon wrapped shrimp  How can you go wrong with a place that wraps things in bacon  Cmon even  veggies admit that things wrapped in bacon are good  Has a smokey atmosphere and a slight bar crowd but the food is outstanding
1,"I give this location no love  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place  the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way  your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us sushi took forever and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet  
When paying the bill we present the voucher to the waitress who says she cant take it  The manager came over with a bitchy look basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes  certainly NOT appreciated  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it taking ANOTHER 10 minutes and finally gives us our bill back  only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously

Dont bother with this location  you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn  

And for the sake of all that is holy  STOP WITH THE CRAZY IMTOOSEXYFORMYSELF SCENE  YOURE NOT THAT COOL"
5,Dr Norton and his staff are friendly and professional They have made my 3 children feel relaxed and comfortable I highly recommend this office
5,This speakeasy was kickass The staff is super down to earth and the menu is great The drive thru is an awesome touch I got the Turkey Club and it was reallllllly good We received 2 randomly free samples of a shake and smoothie and had some good conversation with the guys behind the counter It gets a little noisy if theyre makin shakes in there and the seating is pretty limited I wish they were open later but so far Im loving it
1,Qverpriced substandard food  Never met a cheeseburger I didnt like until now NOT a 12 lb   Small portions of tired room temperature frypieces  burnt bacon chicken tenders so hard they couldnt be penetrated with a fork  Mediocre service  didnt bring kids meal cookie  Waste of 
1,"What was Dunkin Donuts thinking when they took out the selection of donuts and now only offer a choice of 10  It used to be you couldnt decide which one to get now you just have to settle for what they have  This new and improved Dunkin Donuts is the worst  I will return for coffee when I get the urgebut never for a donut  
Oh and another thingmy Dunkin Donuts used to have Baskin Robbins insidethat is gone tooagain WHAT WERE THEY THINKING"
5,Love the food here  Been here a few times and got the peanut curry twice and been delish  Thai iced tea was great as well  Only been there during lunch and everything seems pretty good so far  Went with coworkers and family and they all loved it too  Service was fast prompt and nice  Will be back again to try other dishes
5,Unique selection of antiques linen and assorted pictures and estate jewlery along with new timeless designs Located in downtown Gilbert worth the trip
5,"Honestly the best part of this place is the unbelievable deal you can get on pet related products Because they are one of the primary income sources for HALO Animal Rescue people that have pets tend to make donations You can almost always find pet carriers for under 10 They have dog crates for training and you dont have to shell out a fortune for them They have fish tanks that will allow you to let little Johnny get his feet wet in the world of pet care and the associated responsibilities without breaking the bank If you are a person that shares your life with animals you understand the rarity of these kinds of deals

Yes they have clothes furniture tchatchkies etc but the real deals are on the pet products

As a side note HALO recently leased the MCCAC location at 5231 North 35th Avenue It was the previous Maricopa County run cat adoption center So if you are looking for a companion cat or dog check them out and support one of the fastest growing nokill efforts in the US

5,My wife and I went to Harris Dental for a few years when we lived in Scottsdale  We moved out of town in 2009 but we have never forgotten the superb dental care that we received from Dr Joe Harris who had come highly recommended from our Austin TX dentist as a person who keeps up wth dental research  Nor have we forgotten the fabulous and uniformly cheerful staff  So it wasnt really too surprising that we received a call from Harris Dental a few days ago  more than three years after we moved away  asking for permission to archive our dental xrays and asking where they might send funds from a credit to our account  Who does that
1,We bought or second Jura Compressa coffee machine from Sur La Table  It was an expensive model priced over 3K  After 25 short months it stopped working  The only  option they offered was to send it in for repair  When I asked to have it replaced I was told the turn around was 48 hours  Its actually 4 5 weeks when all is said and done  I high priced item and thats the kind of customer service Not to mention an expensive product that cant make it 90 days  Extremely bad customer service on this one
5,"Im completely impressed by The Mission and I cant wait to go back and try more of their amazing food  

My husband and I chose The Mission for our 8th Anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time  the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable and very warm  welcoming  Yelp steered us in the right direction as per usual so we split the cheese plate with manchego to start the pork shoulder tacos for dinner and split a pumpkin bread pudding for dessert  Everything was expertly prepared and delicious  The bread pudding was EASILY the best Ive ever had  We usually dont order desserts and Im glad we did because I cant stop thinking about how amazing this was  

My husband had an Avocado Margarita and an Estrella beer Awesome that they have this available  and it was even served in an Estrella glass  impressive  Since Im pregnant I asked if the bartender could make me a virgin version of their Sophia Loren with fresh strawberries  mint  score  It was delicious and Ill certainly be back to try it with the proper amount of booze 
  
Lastly how amazing is that Himalayan Salt Brick wall  I NEED this in my house"
5,"a G Spot is a myth  and Dr Graffenberg was a mad scientist

So its no surprise that I couldnt find the Gelato Spot either  Shannon spouts I love gelato so much I would bathe in it  Hmmm thats interesting

I drove in and around the dirt road
 and went up and down Scottsdale 
 explored the box
 looked south of the landing strip at Scottsdale Airpark
 manually googled it
 orally asked the passerbys

Road several times and I couldnt find it ANYWHERE

Maybe I need to do more research  Perhaps some field researchOr a targeted focus group

 UPDATE  
Its on Shea Blvd  No wonder I couldnt find it
I was looking down the wrong road

 UPDATE  
Thanks Jake P for Yeah it is on Shea in the strip mall area east of scottsdale rd near the Harkins Theater and Pita Jungle and such 
BUT the point of this review was sarcasm  ie g spot is hard to find

 UPDATE  
Now I have a girl Shannon W telling me where gspot is  She writes 
Its on 74th St and Shea in between Coffee Plantation and Pita Jungle
Shannon W  The point of this review was sarcasm  ie gspots are hard to find"
5,THis place is great I need an adjustment every now and then but I live in Scottsdale and my regular Chiropractor is so good that he is always booked up ahead of time so if I tweek my back unexpectedly I cant get in soon enough quite often So now I have a place to go seven days a week that is every bit as good as my normal Chiro I have only gone to the weekend chiro but my wife and one of my employees have seen Dr Brian and they love him So if you need a good Chiro go see these guys any day of the week Try em youll love em
1,What are you all talking about This place is awful Theres a reason why these sandwiches are 3 I cant believe so many people like this place although the place was filled with the Chinese people and they have been known to have different taste buds  You get a 10 inch piece of bread with a bunch of stringy cheap vegetables From what they said there was meat on there too  however i forgot to bring my microscope to verify if there was any on there This place is like a middle school cafeteria smack dab in the heart of Tokyos slums i dont know any Vietnamese cities Please homeless people save your quarters youre too good for this place They have good milkshakes but if you really are homeless as you should be if youre going to Lees you shouldnt be buying rich people milk shakes anyways stick with the dollar menu

5,"I LOVE this place From the moment you walk up to the door it is spotless Sometimes you will be approached by an employee asking if you need assistance majority of the time you wont talk to one employee which is great I just want to go in get what I need and peace out until next time without the small chatter 

Their hummus is AMAZING along with a few of the prepackaged meals Their Creamy Cilantro Salad Dressing is OMG AMAZING
Sweet tea LOVE IT"
5,This place is great for a big group of people We originally thought we were going to have 6 people We ended up having 11 by the time everyone showed up The staff was more than happy to accommodate us The Kota Athenian chicken is very good The price range is moderate All in all a fantastic place
5,Dr Natalie is a compassionate empathetic caring DC She listens takes her time with you and always strives not only to make you feel better but to keep you feeling better Her new location is adorable I highly recommend her
5,"I must hand it to them at Olive and Ivy First rate atmosphere and food
The pesto is the most flavorful I have ever had and that includes pesto I have eaten in Italy
Wine selection is terrific The breakfast lunch and dinners are wonderful The bar feels a bit like a meat market but that is the only down side
It is beautiful clean and worth returning to again and again"
5,"OK Where do I start

This place is AMAZING I love the food here especially the fact that you can eat and watch a movie at the same time Forget about the movie theater popcorn you can get a rack of ribs here while enjoying your movie

Before the movie starts a waiter walks around with an iPod touch taking your order usually during the previews During the movie you can press the Service Light to add more things to your order About nearing the end of the movie you will get your check so make sure that if you want more food get your orders in before the movie is over

Pricing is good it costs about the same as  a dinner and a movie separately why NOT kill two birds with one stone and get it all at once The seats are REAL COMFORTABLE as long as you get the love seat or leather seats just dont get the office chair seats as those are likesitting in an office chair for 3 hours watching a movie "
5,"Ive been in a handful of times and last night was also no disappointment After looking for a place to have a glass of wine late I ended up here as 3 or 4 other places in Old Town were either closed Napoleons and Tapas Papas Fritas both closed at 11 PM Well Napoleons closed forever so I heard but wont believe or dead Citizen had a multicourse private affair they were finishing up Kazimierz had some kind of themed jazz party going and was raucous and demanded a cover charge But good ol cosmopolitancool AZ88 was next on my list where I had a fantastic Pinot Noir and Tempranillo cheese plate their kitchen stays open till 1230 every night and warm and friendly convo with spoton bartender Steen Another bartender came in later and was relating his favorite summer drinks in a bon vivant fashion They do have a killer Moscow Mule which is served in a copper tankard to keep it cool 

Ive been coming in here on average maybe once or twice a year since around 2007 and let me say at AZ88 the good things dont change They still have a tantalizing food menu they are a full boar upscale restaurant and a drink menu that together rival anything else really in Lower Scottsdale and in much of the Valley Not to mention the atmosphere that for me has the perfect combination of sophistication decor music 4 more stars for the DJs mellowambient rhythms service and vibe that indulges all the senses wonderfully Im now making this place my default destination for treating myself or a date like VIPs as theyve shown what it takes to to be among the best at what they do"
1,"This place is pure crap The players are subpar and unentertaining  especially Mike Clement and Julie Martinez   and the door men are ridiculously cheesy and rude 
Im a regular at piano bars all over the country when Im traveling Petes Piano Bar in Austin Howl At The Moon in Scottsdale and The Big Bang in Tempe is a terrible destination Save your tips and bar  for the aforementioned places and take my word for it"
1,If we hadnt arrived after a tiring day and prepaid online I would have checked out  Furniture missing  Security bar sheared off  Faceplates for wiring gone  Furniture handles missing  Bobby pins and scraps of things on carpet  hadnt been vacuumed  Two remaining chairs badly stained  You wouldnt want to sit on them  No uniforms or name tags on staff  Pick another chain  The reviews for the other Ramadas in the area  which I read after the fact  reflect the same things
5,WOW  This places is incredible  I can honestly say that everything on the menu is wonderful  Its the perfect date place since you can order booze to cure the date jitters  Also you can satisfy your dieting girlfriend and still order a big plate of man food  The best part about their menu is the fact that it is SO TASTY with being HEALTHY  The extra care in picking ingredients grillingcooking with little fats and unique spice combinations truly makes PJ stand out  The decors nod to local artists also helps make the dining room an enjoyable place to be  For a perfect healthy and satisfying vegetarian lunch I recommend the following  A small Greek salad with an order of the jalapeño or roasted red pepper hummus PS  theyll let you order the hummus half and half
1,"Still a place that is unacceptable in my bookespecially when a server there goes out of their way to message me privately on Yelp to complain about my punctuation and signing offevery so sincerely i might add with  love the Btchy waitress from AZ88

Way to keep it classy over there"

5,Umm this place is awesome I got a bike basket for 25 cents 25 cents Too often these days I run into thrift stores that miss the thrifty part but not this one Its fun to shop and you may end up finding a truly good deal
5,"I work right down the street from Press and have been a huge fan from my very first visit The staff is unbelievably friendly and extremely passionate about their craft Everything from the food to the coffee is first rate They always accommodate my special requests a little more of this none of that and always make good suggestions when Im looking for something new
 I love the yogurt and granola parfait strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola for breakfast with a white chocolate latte Also the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling For lunch my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad
 Also worth mentioning is that they have the VERY BEST iced coffee around They call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee I just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick
  My favorite part about Press are their delectable desserts The berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like youve won the lottery And the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies warmed up are a weekly addiction of mine
  Starbucks is a thing of the past Im lucky to be in close proximity to Press but I think I would even make the drive just for that mascarpone cake"
5,"I have used Sandellas on three different occasions for catering lunches to business offices 
Jeff  owner does a fantastic job at not only running a great business but also with the quality of food he prepares for customers and excellent customer service and catering as well 
My offices that I bring lunch to love this food fare It is a healthy alternative that many of my offices are craving after having so many lunches brought to them that weigh them down and make them feel like going to sleep after lunch As a part of our healthcare community this food is something I feel confident about bringing to my colleges and offices that I visit It taste great it is made with only the best ingredient personally selected by Jeff and it is best of all  healthy"
5,"I stumbled across this place after missing my usual Light Rail stop on my way to pick up a Zipcar at the downtown ASU campus

First I tried my usual caffeine fixa nonfat double latte Excellent

Second trip back I gave the breakfast burrito plus bacon a try Delicious The tortilla was as good as everything inside

Third trip a beet salad and a bacon chocolate chip cookie Bacon and chocolate for the win

Ive been here three times and have not been disappointed The decor is modest but functional as it should be at a good business with honestly good food The barista is not only knowledgable and skilled but is also a genuine sweetheart

Its just a couple of blocks from the Jefferson and First Street Light Rail stop East bound so Ive been stopping by on my way to work"
5,great wine selection except they are always out of greg norman and ive never got to try it
5,Great fruit and vegetables Bulk items like nuts and cranberries are a good value Check out the meat and deli Cage free chicken and grass fed beef Salmon and Tuna are fresh They do have some good values here The cashiers are good and give the nickel bag discount
5,I like their seating area It has a nice sized inside area and also a bright outside area that is tucked between a walkway and another store One of my favorite locations
5,"As a real estate investor I need contractors that I can truly count on to get things done for me  This means that my calls get returned in a timely fashion work is done properly quickly and competently but most importantly that I get quoted a fair price for a good job  

Dont give me drama and definitely dont give me any bullshit excuses or sales pitches

Im so glad to have found David and Tracy  They run a tight ship they are extremely professional and I sensed their sincerity from the word hello and I talk to contractors and real estate agents almost every single day

Thank you for a job well done  You have definitely made the cut as part of my go to crew not only for my rental properties but as a highly recommended vendor to my Sonoran desert friends colleagues and neighbors

Cheers"
1,I understand Im not dude and so Im not there to state at your twin peaks however that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer Im over it So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time Fries were soggy and our server disappeared We all decided were not going back Just because your a good looking server doesnt give you an excuse for sucking
5,"Its 1961 and were having lunch in the courtyard of our Miami Beach hotel Parker House rolls sweet and salty an openface meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy Theres a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers But wait  somethings wrong Theres no humidity Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy I work to orient myself in time and space and find what a relief that Im actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and its 2010

 The Valley Ho Resort which houses the Cafe is such a wonderful period piece It opened in 1956 and was renovated in 2005 by a very wise design team that left the midcentury architecture and spirit intact Cafe ZuZu is at the far end of the lobby and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers The decor is late 50s If youre as old as we are youll recognize it instantly The menu consists of Flavorful American comfort food Familiar favorites with a contemporary twist There are goodies like warm Maytag blue cheese fondue 750 truffled grilled cheese 9 beef stroganoff 17 and gross tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly

 While waiting for our entrees we received a basket of Parker House rolls These are the nice squishy white bread treats that if you can manage not to eat them all make wonderful toys You can mold them into sculptures or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw My meatloaf sandwich 1125 was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese then the meatloaf then the gravy There was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside They were so smooth Ken wondered if they were made from instant but they tasted much too good for that The portion was huge I took half home of course I knew I was going to have dessert Ken had sauteed liver beautifully prepared atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon sauced with a Madera reduction He loved it I surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart 6 for us to share There were several chocolate desserts that sounded good but I had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood The tart had only modest swirls of meringue but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy as opposed to foamy and it was really goodThe lemon custard was the star I remembered a gelatinous filling but this was smooth and velvety with just the right tartsweet balance The pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust and stood up well to the filling

 This was not an inexpensive meal but the portions are large and quality is excellent Plus we had joined an organization called The Lunch Club which every weekday emails its members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code So one of our entrees was free The discount coupons differ some are 20 off the bill others merely are for a free drink But to pay Cafe ZuZu the ultimate compliment  Id come here and pay full price"
5,Love the carne asada
5,"St Francis gives the impression you could be dining in one of the finest cities in the world instead of the 5th largest cities in the USA

Start with their cucumber gin drink and then order another  Goat cheese on crostini follows  Insist on extremely memorable whipped potatoesa side order to accompany your salmon on red quinoa  Dessert MUST be the chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato accompanied by carmel sauce trailings and carmel corn garnishes

Try dining at the bar for an uncluttered view out the picture window opening minus the glass

Loved it  Will happily return

They split our entree for us AND were gracious about the extra trouble we causednot a wimper  Truly superior service "
1,"No  

If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai that is what I will say 

0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson  

0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it

In this case I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo and both in Tempe  The other half was in Tampa and since he does not care much for Thai I get the chance to try one  

The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 517 PM and connected me with another limo at Broadway With traffic getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes  On exiting the limo 550 PM I walked back about half a block to the restaurant

On entering the restaurant I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me  He asked me where I wanted to sit at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tankor the next table which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant  

There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you  Then again your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED

When I was seated staffperson offered to bring water  The phone rang and he was off as he offered another version of I am the only staffperson here  I looked at the menu and made my decision In the menu there is a 2 charge listed for sharing  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served  Because of my proximity to the fish tank I was quite up close and personal with the fish The water probably isnt filthy but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception 

6 PM as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order 601 the staffperson comes bearing a pitcher of water and a My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned smile  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom the Thai name for the green papaya salad Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items  The phone rang again

Staffpersons attention was no longer on me  The phone his Pavlovian stimuli had taken him away  I asked if he had heard me  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone  He asked if I minded waiting as he was the only staffperson  I said I would wait  Off he went in pursuit of electronic interaction  

610 PM staffperson returns apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen  The phone rang as he left the table  his pace quickening as he approached the phone  

618 PM the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons  

620 PM staffperson returns He brings the salad and a bowl of rice  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad  Som Tom does not have cucumber shredded lettuce or cilantro  On sending back the initial preparation staffperson returned with the original preparation advising the chef stated This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish  I sent the order back citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation

625 pm  As I empty my water glass the salad I received previously is returned minus the cucumber  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original he replied that he did not know  I stood and left  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have The Best Curry in the Valley   they will get no second chance to prove it to me  For all the phone activity there was no one who came to pick up a carryout order  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business"
5,"My wife called to have our vent cleaned since our dryer was taking over an hour to dry an average load Our appointment was scheduled for 8 am not for 812 as most places He showed up at 8 and had the vent clean and working well Excellent customer service and very friendly
Thanks again
Gary"
5,"WOW I had read and heard alot of good things about Smeeks and I thought It must be too good to be true and while out shopping for a few items today I was proven wrong 
I walked in and I instantly felt like a kid in a candy store They had candy fun novelties and I swear everything I looked at it made me think of a friend who would love to find it in their stocking on Christmas day 
The store was packed it is 3 days before Christmas but the staff was friendly helpful and went around to make sure everyone found what they needed or if they needed a basket 
Guys Ill be back here throughout the year and you should check it out If it doesnt make you smile or make you want to sift through all the goodies you probably kick kittens for fun and thats not cool"
5,"My husband  I are addicted to Cherryblossoms ramen Mr T is Japanese  I lived in Japan for 4 years so take my word its authentic

The mix of foods is not so strange if youre familiar with restaurants in Japan The ramen is Hakata style made with a pork broth  may be heavyoily for some people so why not please everybody Be sure to ask for Cha Shu Ramen to get a few more pieces of pork extra 

The salads are also fantastic warm lightly fried 10Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing  Shanghai Duck salad and the Chicken Caesar was perfect not heavily dressed like some roadhouses 

Mr T  our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce  even the California Roll was good

Its said Japan took the best of each countrys cuisine So there are French pastries German beer Italian pasta and Indian curries Save the banana bread for dessert if you can or get one of their pastries Ive never have enough room

If you like good WHITE bread buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago

I think its too small for groups over six

Maybe well see you there

Added 111807
I think that their menus are not all alike so if  ramen isnt on the menu you receive you can still order it Its posted in Japanese on the wall For the basic ask for Hakata Ramen For extra pork ask for Chashumen or Chashuramen
Either way theres really not much pork in it Thats why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad"
5,"Went here for lunch after riding dirt bikes in the desert We have had Mellow Mushroom in Georgia and Florida but this one was top notch  Very clean staff very friendly  and food OMG to die for 

The garlic cheese bread is fantastic and the calzones are my favorite"
5,Once you buy a steak from von hansons you will never buy steak anywhere else again  This is the best butcher shop I have ever seen  Also great sausages chicken cuts of lamb I also get my thanksgiving turkey here
1,ok let me be straight with you i hate paying full price for anything yes im one of those people i love a coupon i love a discount and i absolutely love a bargain but i dont like to feel dirty when i leave a store i felt really really dirty when i left this store ewwwwww this is a yucky ross dirty dirty dirty the floors and clothing racks were filthy i couldnt have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross  i got black stuff on my hand after touching a clothing rack the floor was so discolored im not sure what the original color was parts of the stores floor were sticky many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them presumably from the dirty hangars and racks they are stored on selection was meager there wasnt a single shoe bag wallet sock or home decor item that caught my eye the trip was a waste of an hour that ill never get back never ever again
5,Please know that this place is WORTH the long wait  I come to Phoenix once a month for work and I make sure I have dinner here  There is NOT one thing I can complain about  Remember good things come to those who wait  I HIGHLY recommend waiting in the house next door and having some wine  The bartenders are very friendly  The main restaurant will call the house when your tablebar seat is ready  The pizza is baked in a stone brick oven  Real firewood is used not like California Pizza Kitchens gas oven  The owner himself makes the pizza  Every employee is genuinely nice  With each bite you have a subtle taste of smoke not overwhelming  The crust is thin and crispyAND MOST IMPORTANTLYyou can fold the slice  for all you NJNY natives  My stomach is churning and mouth salivating as I write more  I am going to Phoenix this Thursdayguess where Ill be  PSGuys phenomenal eye candy
5,You know for a goodwill this one really isnt bad  They have a ton of clothes that are actually displayed to make them look orderly and clean instead of the usual crammed heaps and stacks you see  I love the books  a great selection of books you have always meant to read and I dont mean the old classics though they have those too like James Patterson Anne Rice and all those gooey Twilight books  Looks like they moved out most of the furniture recently but perhaps they will be getting a new shipment soon  Lots of knickknacks and vases and about 25 printers to choose from  Check here first if you are looking for one of the above stated items  they is a good chance you will find it
1,Im not sure what all of the buzz is about because this place wasnt that great I had the grilled cheese and it was hard and dry  There was this nasty drunk guy who sat across from our table and it was quite sickening I will not be going back
5,"As far as sports bars go this one cant be beat You wont find one in the East Valley with better food beer selection happy hour or a friendlier staff This is handsdown one of my favorite places in all of Ahwatukee and the surrounding areas

Ive been here bunches of times and the only one bad experience I had overcooked burger they took care of the situation above and beyond

I cant say it enough go eat drink see for yourself Public House is the best around"
1,"This place is the whitetrash Chipotle The food is mediocre at best I mean seriously how can you just up and steal Chipotles idea Theres no creativity there The Habenaro Salsa is flavorless and not hot at all Seriously I asked for HOT not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who cant handle real salsa  At least Chipotle has hot salsa not too hot either but much better for a fast Americanized mexican food Of course I much rather have the real deal but I do like Chiptole for what it is Not this crap that Qdoba tries to serve up 
The chicken is over seasoned and highly spicedherbed you can barely taste the chicken The Fajita veggie were the same The product looked of very low quality Oxidizing Guacamole and Lettuce The meat looked unappetizing as well Just not at the level of Chipotle Although I have been here twice this is the last time for me I have been to one in Denver and for some reason thought it was better So maybe its management but I can say the food is less than good I much rather go to Chiptole than this wannabe Employees were dumber than a bag of Frijoles
This place has the worst Mexican Food I have ever had next to a pre made burrito from 711 or a burrito from Taco Bell Just disgusting food"
5,"I see Jenny Strebe who cuts and Veronica Peebles who colors They are AMAZING I am so glad they opened Salon Stylush it is the perfect size not too huge and crazy and it is so modern  cute 

Jenny is an amazing hair stylist with the accolades to prove it she styles hair for fashion shows magazines television etc Jenny has been cutting my hair for years and she is super sweet and super talented I trust her with my hair no question and recommend her highly Also she has a talent for mens hair as well She cuts my husbands hair and that is one of his best qualities Id say There are so many men out there with bad hair  Jenny knows how to make it work for men

Veronica has colored my hair for years  and she is hands down one of the best in the industry I never loved my color until I found Veronica Now I trust her completely and know shell make my hair look great and natural which is important to me Shes also super sweet I highly recommend Veronica as a stylist and colorist"
5,Love this place Wish we had one here in CA Great vibe once you walk through that door Fantastic drinks and goodies
1,Price reflects quality and service  52010 purchased wedding gown brides maids and mothers bride and groom mothers and grandmothers dresses  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding
5,The folks here are the best
5,After unsuccessfully attempting a walk in gel at the posh looking Sundrops nail salon with my two year old in tow I was drawn to a half deserted strip mall just down the street and a small space in the center labeled Andys Nails I Yelped the place and saw the decent reviews so I walked in and was immediately attended to by the friendliest faces Ive seen in a while Despite the fact that I was short one babysitter they began work on my nails right away and when my toddler got restless one of the very nice owners picked her up and carried her around for 20 minutes  Not only do they now offer Gelish gel manicures but they offer more colors than many other ArcadiaBiltmoreCamelback Corridor nail salons AND theyre cheaper by anywhere from 520 Im definitely going back and going back soon My toes are lonely
5,"Ever eat at a Steak n Shake  Thats what Freddys is a Steak N Shake kind of burger and its delicious 

I liked the fries too very thin perfectly hot not too much salt

Nice people the manager made it a point to get me my meal hotoffthegrill even though I came ahead of the call and again he met me while he was cleaning tables  See my review of The Habit their manager never greets customers cant solve problems from behind a door always hiding in his office  Freddys Manager was OUTFRONT ALL THE TIME WORKING HARD  

Great burger  Next time Ill get the frozen custard  I was too full from my triple cheese CALIFORNIA STYLEBABY"
5,Romantic quaint amazing We were referred here by a couple of long time Phoenix locals and we were so happy we took their advice We ordered a white pizza a antipasta appetizer and bottle of Chianti We were able to get a table outside and loved the atmosphere Perfect date spot
5,"Another vacation that started and ended with US Airways 

We arriveddeparted on time both ways My normal sized butt still fits in seats so no issue there I enjoyed my free drink and chitchat with the flight attendants Brought my own snacks and read a book All in all a good beginningend to a relaxing vacay with the man friend"
1,First off I would like to punch the dip Shit on the food network who said this was the best chicken he ever ate Yeah the place is filthy but how they operate their business is redicolus Service sucks 49 minute wait for the food sucks waiting 20 minutes from the first  entree being dropped off until the last person luckily receives their food sucks being told on the 59th minute of a hour wait for your food that they are out of your side dishes sucks spending my hard earned money at a place that is Ass backwards in any kind of business sense sucks At first our group thought it was a joke then the reverse racism theory was brought up then we noticed that every table was experiencing the same lack of service Black white purpleorange They just sucked
5,I love this place People are very friendly and very clean restaurant I come here with co workers for lunch on a weekly basis I order a gyro pita and side of Greek fries so delicious The salads are huge and tasty as well The Greek fries are amazing with feta cheese and a lemon butter sauce they put over the fries I can eat here everyday
5,"Awesome

So much better than parking on site

Safe and good prices keep me coming back

Flying during a busy time go to their website to make a reservationthats right a reservation Also print out a coupon for a couple bux off per day"
5,"My family and I ate here Saturday nightbased on the reviews of Yelp
We were not disappointed as a matter of fact we were pleasantly surprised with every aspect of our evening  When you arrive at Bobby Qs the outside makes it feel as if you are about to walk into a dive  However when you turn the corner and walk in the door that is not the case  Very nice ambiance throughout the entire restaurant They had wonderful mood lighting I love low mood lighting  Our server was very friendly and helpful  Our meals were excellent  My husband got the Chicken Fried Chicken and I got the Top Sirloin  We started with the corn bread which was delicious  I dont care if it feel apart at least it wasnt dry  My top sirloin was cooked a perfect Medium and seasoned exceptionally well  I really loved it and I love steak  Surprisingly the roasted corn was one of my favorites of the night I dont usually gobble up corn when I get it with dinner but man this was some heavenly corn  My husbands chicken fried chicken was perfect  Pounded thin with a light crispy batter I hate to say it but it might have been better than Texaz Grills chicken  It was tasty  My son got the oven cooked pepperoni pizza and it was a large portion for the 400 price tag he even took some home  Our food was excellent there wasnt one thing we didnt like the food was hot the service was great the atmosphere was great we will return"
1,The staff at this location was rude and unfriendly Also the store itself was not the cleanest I have seen
5,Stephen G hit the nail on the head  You buy a peaceful experience I was looking for a resortspa but also wanted to take advantage of horseback riding as much as I could This resort definitely exceeded my expectations  the staff is AMAZING friendly accommodating etc the food was delicious the resort is beautiful and the rooms were also clean and wellmaintained Everyone I encountered went the extra mile with regard to service I came back to NYC completely rejuvenated
5,"This place is great A coworker and I stopped in for lunch this afternoon and was blown away by both the food and staff

You get a large bowl from the cashier and can personally stuff whatever meat veggies and garnish you want Then mix a neat selection of sauces Finally watch the entertaining chefs cook your meal on a large heated stone

Everything comes out fresh hot and delicious Want a tip Use the wax paper next to the chicken to stuff your bowl Everything will shrink when cooked and this will allow you to have a bigger meal for the same price"
5,Great food and drink The traditional margaritas are the best Sara was our server and she was very knowledgable about the menu and was quite entertaining The cheese enchilada that I had was one of the best ever
5,"I love this location and I love this product  

I think the prices are reasonable considering the quality of product you are getting  If youve only been to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location and hate it give this one a try  Its got a much better vibe and is a lot less packed  

Walked right in was helped she grabbed what I needed and I was off  It took all of 15 minutes even with picking out a totally new foundation then I used before"
5,"This place is as good as Id heard  We came here for a daylate birthday dinner for my middle daughterFathers Day dinner for her husband  She and his sixyear old daughter ordered a Hawaiian style with pineapple and ham he and I  got the Margherita Pizza with garlic tomatoes olive oil fresh basil mozzarella and romano cheese  Both were so delicious  He also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all dipped in either of two great sauces ranch or marinara  The pizzas were about 13 each for the larges  I usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the  flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good I couldnt resist taking a third piece at this place 

The decor was pretty and the service was greatthe server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything

 I would definitely be a regular if I lived near here  


On a side note next door is the Aloha Kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good

5,"Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist  Its epic  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off  Basically every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years

Enter Dr Marcia Blazer  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale  I literally googled dentists for anxious patients and her name popped up  Her website appeared too good to be true  They offered nitris plus offered non invasive options for dental procedures double plus and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear

I went in for my first visit a cleaning and exam and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel  They were warm and friendly and put me at ease immediately  During the cleaning my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapypointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool insteadfelt like a cool stream of water on your teeth and BAM theyre clean  They were so calming that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities I didnt even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in

Fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment  I had requested nitris hey I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in  Now heres my favorite part  As I sat in the chair the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvds and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedureWhat So I picked a lighthearted comedy 50 First Dates  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use goodbye horrible drilling sound nitris hello happy gas and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth  And we were off  She didnt try to maintain conversation soooo annoying when dentists do that and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasnt quite over  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie

I have had several interactions with this office since then regarding billing and follow up and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them  I highly recommend this office to anyone"
5,"Stinkweeds shaped my formative years  Really

I started shopping at the now gone Tempe location when I was 15  I had a few older friends into independent music who introduced me to this record store  I begged my parents for rides and when that wasnt happening hopped on the bus for the hourlong trek  Totally worth it  100  I cant tell you how many awesome bands I began listening to just because I would browse the selection endlessly for something that looked interesting  If I needed something specifically Stinkweeds would order it for me if they didnt already have it in stock  The staff was always welcoming and helpful sometimes offering their own suggestions

But its just a record store right  Wrong  Stinkweeds is the jewel of Phoenix as far as I am concerned  Now that its out in central Phoenix I make it in far less  Total bummer"
5,"Three cheers to Yelp for helping me find where in the Valley to go for real beef jerky  The fresh stuff which has more beef than chemicals  The convenience store packages just were not doing it for me After checking out the website I emailed good friends in Las Vegas who used to live in Minnesota asking if they were familiar with Von Hansons  They have 21 locations in Minnesota  and ONE in Chandler

My roommate and I went on July 2 They were running a special for NY strips  buy one get one free  so that was added to the plan in addition to the jerkySCORE  We picked up a half pound each of the peppered jerky and the cajun spicy  18lb  The NY strips were if memory serves 1499lb and the steaks were averaging a little over 34 lb  so super yay for the BOGO sale  it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices I have to say  the quality of the meat is amazing  Just looking at the cuts in the display case I can declare Von Hansons makes AJs look like Frys  These were GORGEOUS  Quite possibly the prettiest steaks Ive ever seenI also grabbed a couple pigs ears for my dog and the roommate picked up a package of her favorite kind of sausage linguisa

Admittedly I am not a sausage expert  Plus I live very close to Schreiners  so while I would have no problem buying sausage from Von Hansons I wouldnt make the hike to Chandler just for those  The selection was quite impressive though

Overall  this place has everything for carnivorial happiness  Hey  if you understood the context its a word right  Great selection of beef chicken and pork products  Tons of spices sauces rubs and marinades  Nice selection of unique beer and wines  Fridge and freezer cases with more meats sides and desserts Yes its pricey  but the quality is certainly there to justify it

Once home we grilled up the steaks using our favorite rub  OMG amazing meat  Probably the best steak Ive had in YEARS  and NY strip isnt even my cut of choice

The peppered beef jerky is full of YUM  and this is so strange to write  but the Cajun is a bit spicy for my taste  And I adore spicy  Its amazingly good and addictive  but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat

The Vegas via Minnesota friends emailed back Monday  they know Von Hansons quite well  and are grateful there isnt one in Vegas  it would KILL the weekly grocery budget with how often theyd be in  They love love LOVE the place  and I am now under strict orders to bring them care packages from here whenever I come up to visit

Oh  and Layla my pooch was pretty stoked about the pig ears  so in addition to my five stars please add two paws up  I didnt tell her they have a whole dog food and treat section  I am on a budget after all"
5,How could you write a bad review about a mountain  Great sight to see
5,Business takes me out to Mesa yesterday  After chatting with a friend about possible lunch locations he tells me about Georges Gyros near University and Country Club  I decide to give it a try as it isnt too far from my destination  Situated right next door to Sun Devil Liquors Im surprised I hadnt been there before or for that matter even noticed it  I guess when I hit SDL Ive got tunnel vision  First thing I notice is there appears to be plenty of parking even at 1230 for lunch  Outer patio stuck out into the parking lot not overly appealing might be nicer in the evening I guess  The interior is clean plenty of seating a small bar at one end and a counter from which you place your order  Never having been before I ask the counterperson for a recommendation  Whats good  He suggests the Original Gyro served with fries or a greek salad  Sounds good Ill take it with fries  With drink under 9  A few moments later actually I saw three other tables get served so it seemed like a longish wait a ginormous gyro arrives with a huge helping of fries  The gyro was huge overflowing with umm meat gyro meat I guess white onions diced tomatoes and cucumber sauce Tzatziki I think  The meat was well cooked artfully shaved and tender  The sauce was also very good  The pita  Warm soft and tasty  The fries Crisp and golden brown and piping hot about 34 times the size of Mickie Ds or about 12 a steak fry  I was very impressed with the quality of the food the cleanliness of the dining area and the presence of a bar  Most folks were eating gyros or good sized greek salads  Other items on the menu include several different gyros burgers sandwiches a decent selection of pasta dishes and all kinds of Greek and nonGreek appetizers  I plan on coming back perhaps before a foray into Sun Devil Liquors
5,YOWZA I love this place I had heard great things about this place before and actually received some of the olives and olive oil as a gift last year I decided to take my mom and try it out for lunch The food was pretty good but the best thing for me is that they have Cerignola olives This was music to my ears when they told me they had them I have been looking everywhere checking every grocery store gourmet shop in Chandler and Tucson and nobody has them I cant wait to go back and try the rest of their menu Oh and expect a little off roading the parking lot is loose gravel 
5,Let me preface this story with the fact that it was not my little guy who I had to take in I am dog sitting my friends dog They are on vacation Dr Alber and his amazing staff were unbelievable I called at 515 They got me in at 530 Dr Alber spent 40 minutes with me Explained everything to me thoroughly Little Rusty just has allergies and an eye infection but it was making him miserable Dr Alber gave me a plan of attack to care for it EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE 70 out the door RX in hand and a tube of eye drops I am in awe I will recommend this clinic to everyone I know I just cannot say enough good things about these lovely people THANK YOU PRESTIGE ANIMAL CLINIC YOU ROCK I will now be taking my own little guy there You guys are now the only vet I will ever use
5,"Where I had the most delicious thing I ever put in my mouth

This is a favorite of me and my friends especially for sunday morning brunch I would say we go at least one time a week Their Quiche especially the Goat cheese caramelized onions and wallnuts is the best you will ever have and their salad dressing which is made in house is equally delicious The most delicious thing I have ever eaten in my whole life was actually a rose macaroon I have never had an emotional reaction to a food item before but I swear I almost cried and had flashbacks of my childhood being at the botanical gardens Any way if you havent been here you HAVE to go Its one of Arizonas few authentic cultural treasures"
5,"Gosh Darn It They had to be good I was hoping since they are so close to my home  and right next to where I shop for groceries most often Fresh  Easy that theyd be horrible Then Id never have to go again But alastoo good to not go back thats for sure

Ive said it before Ill say it again if you dont like a lot of frosting just wipe off the portion you dont want Heck if youre sitting next to me and my kids theyll eat it for you

I didnt think I was much of an frosting fan either so I wiped off most from the Chocolate Chip Caramel only to find that the milk chocolate frosting covered with a caramel drizzle was UHMAZING Scraped that heap right back in my mouth where it belongs Yum Equally impressive it the dense moist cake as opposed to light and fluffy texture these puppies are HEAVY The White Chocolate Raspberry was chockfull of white chocolate chips and the frosting was not too sweet It was the prettiest one as well with white sprinkles and raspberry sauce drizzle Thoroughly enjoyed the two other chocolate selections Texas Milk Chocolate  Midnight Magic as wellYes I had four but only cut them in half so I could save the rest for my husband later

Bonus points for presentation the box is adorable and variety"
5,This place is an experience  I cant stop thinking about it  I love the weird odd flavors Basil Lime  and everything tastes so fresh and organic  Its nice to have something like this close by our house  A true guilty pleasure
5,Being from Sweden you just like salmon and at Le Chalet you can get a delicous Nordique Crepe with salmon Never had anything like that in Sweden Besides the great crepe and friendly service from the owner Alain Keller I was also treated to a laughing experience They have a comedy show twice a month Great place to eat and have a nice relaxed evening
1,Very nice location but food was awful  Had a chicken salad yuck  Service stunk big time
5,"This is a quaint little airport which is very convenient if you are travelling to the TempeMesa area or already know people who live there  I say its convenient if you are flying in from Grand Island or Grand Forks or Rapid City or East Bugtussel since the only commercial tenant at this decomissioned air force base is Allegiant Airlines which specializes in flying you from nowhere to somewhere Phoenix Las Vegas Orlando that sort of thing  

But from landing to sitting in my rental car it was maybe 20 minutes tops and I was heading out to lunch in the Phoenix area dont bother with purchasing the snacks on the flight just make sure you are prepared beforehand"
5,I just have to tell you that this place is amazing Not only is the food top notch so is the service It is a rare find to get awesome food a comfortable environment and excellent service at a reasonable price all rolled into one The homemade sausage is excellent the pizza is perfect the choice of deli meats is extensive and homemade side salads red potato dill is my favorite and everything on the menu is fantastic I have read that people say the wait is long which I find unfounded but when you are considering what you are getting the wait means nothing I have waited longer for Sysco reheated food in a restaraunt bleh and had worse service I would take a 10 min longer wait for really good fresh food any day If you cant appreciate that then maybe chain restaurants is where you should stay We really do our best to stay away from those and finding places like Defalcos is really tough We will continue to be loyal customers and spread the word of one our favorite places to eat Dont pass the opportunity to try this place
1,"I dont expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall but I expect better than this  The seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment the rainbow roll was barely worth eating  the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy the fish was mealytextured and the rich was soft and too sticky  The yellow tail roll suffered from the same and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi  The miso soup was served barely like warm  The tea was served barely luke warm That was when we finally got service which took a veritable eternity  Tea refills  Good luck on getting someones attention for that

The inside is a dismal cavernous sportbarpool hall sort of feel  Basically no redeeming features here"
5,I went here for my birthday this year The best part was my friends picked up the tab The food was fantastic When I found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club I knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice The only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubswell maybe that wasnt a bad thing after all
5,Wonderful place to hangout with friends small and cozy Hoegaarden white ale with chicken tikka masala pasty is my usual
5,"I dropped off a ton of things here when I was liquidating my life in this town and it was a terrific experience

Their donation program is quick and easy just drive around to the back of the store and put it in a bin and really helps out people by selling things at affordable prices and the profits go to provide assistance to the community

Such great people at this location especially"
5,"I Love Lolos Chicken and Waffles and you will too 

Recently my fiancé and I went to Lolos I had heard about Lolos and Mrs Whites for years but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations When this south Scottsdale location opened I made it a point to go and try the food 

The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent Forget about it But dont forget about it the MACNCHEESE is a most try The chicken is FANTABULOUS the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid Yes I said Kool Aid I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID Before this the last time I had Kool Aid was 1968 

This place is very popular so you may have to wait for a table but it is well worth it This place is so popular that Sports Music Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie He did the song Just a Friend back in 1990  

The only down side  although the service was generally good it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like 

BOTTOM LINE I LEFT FULL HAPPY AND WITH A KOOL AID SMILE TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT"
5,Love Belly Rubz At first little Oscar was timid about me dropping him off but when I came to pick him up he didnt want to quit playing He has really bad separation anxiety and hates kennels so it is always worrisome when we try a new groomer He loved playing and came out looking so handsome We will be returning to Belly Rubz this week for some more play time and grooming
1,"Wish I could rate negative stars With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst

Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friends birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early We finished our last call drinks and started to head out The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving friends still in bathroom but was quickly cut off I watched from the patio as the two bouncers both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment pinned him down with their elbows and hit him At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request He swiped my friends phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive The police arrived and took down the bouncers information and stated that they would be recording this incident

 I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening non physical patrons of their establishment Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law"
5,"Beautiful country setting in Phoenix on an old farm Watch closely because it is easy to miss as it is actually an old farm near the Legacy Golf resort at South Mountain 
Very good home made breakfast with fresh ingredients from the farm 
Orange juice was fresh and tasty 
Eggs and bacon were very good Biscuits and gravy were excellent 
The setting was the star of this breakfast
I would recommend  You wont be sorry "
5,"We ate here to celebrate our engagement during a weekend getaway to AZ My fiance had coordinated with the restaurant beforehand to have rose petals and 2 glasses of champagne set for us before we arrived The rose petals were fresh and a mix of red yellow and pink beautiful colors

I ordered one of their fish dishes that came is a REALLY hot skillet and I accidently burned my hand on the skillet We saw one of the employees walking by so we asked if he had anything for the burn and he ran off looking for burn spray and bandaids He was back in no time with everything I needed to treat the burn  amazing service I THINK his name was Nick but I cant remember

Good job T Cooks"
5,"ive never had a problem getting assistance here except when its busy usually on a satsun its not that far from the house maybe a mile so i if im in a real bind i come on by here to pick up some stuff 

theyve offered groupons here and with those ive bought some power tools and hardware ace brand is cheaper price but the quality seems to be just as good"
1,"This place used to be amazing  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents  Its not the same anymore

We went for my wifes 30th birthday  My dad decided to join us  My wife ordered steak and shrimp my dad ordered steak I ordered a crab stuffed lobster  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before  I was craving it

We got our appetizers  Dad got snails wife and I shared steamers  My dad was happy with the snails  But then again how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers  I wasnt about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams

The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it  It looked dry and over cooked  I told the server Ive had this dish many times before and this is not the way its supposed to be  He told me this is what its supposed to look like and begged me to try it  I took one bite and I couldnt even swallow it because it was so dry  Of course the server was gone by this point and didnt come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was

While I was waiting for the server to return I told my family I was just going to get the steak  They just shook their head and told me not to  I took one bite of my dads steak and spat it out  How do you screw up steak this bad  It tasted like beef jerky and butter  My dad and wife would have complained too but its my wifes birthday and I am already stealing her thunder  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster  How do you screw up a steamed 1 12 lobster  Fortunately that came out fine

So we left hungry and 300 poorer  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now it is not worth it  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down"
5,"Fantastic meal     Fantastic experience     

I am a vegetarian    I cook a lot and am very conscious of food preparation starting with sourcing    I dont just patronize Farmers Markets I patronize CERTAIN Farmers Marketsthat sort of thing    Long story short if I am going to dine out I want something very special  VERY special 

Quiessence exceeded my expectations at almost every turn    I dined there with my son and daughterinlawboth truly expert cooksmore knowledgeable than I     

All of us were BLOWN AWAY by our meal    We got the Farmers Feast without the wine pairings so we could choose our own wine     I got the vegetarianthey got the carnivore or ominvore or whatever they call it     Truthfully labels are irrelevant      Its all in the tasteand the tastes are sublime

I was impressed by how much variety was in each plate      Theirs were similar but each a little different      More importantly there was a marvelous progression of very carefully crafted flavors      

The most impressive thing   The chef clearly wanted to offer his own interpretations      That he did so while letting the fabulous ingredients speak for themselves is truly remarkable

The setting is beautiful     The servers are unpretentiously proud of their community and the work they are doing and seemed to enjoy our enjoyment as well

Our only criticism and it is minor  is that although the desserts were beautifully crafted we felt that they did not reflect the intentions of local sustainability    There is so much wonderful local fruit used in other courses I might addperhaps adding some to the desserts would carry out the theme more completelyIm sure the chefs creativity can conjure more ideas than I

That said I will return    As often as possible    Quiessence and the Farm at South Mountain are an unparalleled resource for the Phoenix communityeasy to get to from any part of the Valleyno excuses folksGo"
5,"what can I say  were CF regularsjust love the place I guess we are lucky because we have never had to wait more than 1520 minutes for 3 of us  We eat here at least twice a month and we always start with the avocado egg rolls  they are to die for and the dipping sauce is yummy  I usually get a Glam burger  the only time I eat red meat   and so far have not had one I did not like I  often take 12 home so I can save room for some cheesecake an absolute must when at CF We have never had a bad cheesecake and try a different one each time This is the only hamburger that I have liked the next day  usually hamburger is the one food that is not a good take home food as it just does not taste good as a left over  but I have actually eaten it cold because I took a bite before heating it and just kept goingyes weird I know

If nothing else go there for some avocado egg rolls and then treat yourself to a cheesecakeIm totally addicted Absolute divine decadence D"
5,Had some amazing cuisine at Milagros The chef is truly an innovative genius Our food was so unique and delicious Plus the weather was so nice that we sat out on their beautiful patio and watched the sunset on the purple mountains I highly recommend the PB  J appetizer Its nothing you have ever had before I can assure you I would also highly recommend the swordfish dish and tacos
5,Decided on a whim at the last minute to go here for dinner tonight I guess thats not the thing to do here  Worked out perfect though arrived at just about 4pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didnt open till 5pm  After a short debate we decided to stay it helped that there was ample shade  The wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order  40 seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town  I also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of 6 to 10 and only 3 reservations per night  Reservations are usually 1 12 to 2 months out  Luckily for us there was only one reserved table for 10 ahead of everyone  5 oclock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after  Service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course  I could not have asked for much more from my food maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad everything was amazing including my Mexican coke  We ordered 2 pizzas both wood fire baked to perfection  I could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads or for 2 on its own  None of our food was greasy or soggy the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering  I will go back again planning on getting there an hour before opening  Although the food is amazing and well worth an hours wait in the Phoenix sun and heat I would not wait for 4 to 6 hours as some people do  So for me this was a win and a lucky last minute dinner decision
5,Great time great location ability to park in garage behind it Beautiful decor candles white furnishings trimmed in wood Excellent vodka choices that will have you dancing on that raised table all nite which gives you a cool panoramic view of the place See if you can spot the dj booth Hes cool friendly door staff The bartenders kind of ignore you and theres a brunette girl bartenderstay away from her Downer attitude and she will charge you for 2 drinks even though they have a 2 for 1 special But its a cool club and its 99 certain youll have great time
5,We drove in from LA for spring training  Had a free evening and the old Pizza Hut remake looked interesting  To our great surprise we had one of the best Thai meals in a long time  Once you get inside youll forget this used to be an old Pizza Hut and youll be transported to a bit of Southeast  Asia  Good food good serviceand the price is great  I loved the eggplant with beef and the Pad See Yew spelled differently  Was going to go again but they close on Sundaysboo  Dont know if its consistently this good but for our one night in Phoenix we were pleasantly surprised  Definitely worth a try if youre looking for good Thai food  You dont necessarily have to have a lot of heat in your food because they have plenty of dishes for chiliadverse people like me but its there for those that need the heat  The food presentation and description will remind you of Chinese cuisine but the flavors are unique and deliciousand definitely NOT Chinese  The Thai fried rice is definitely more than a side dishits a meal in itself  Try this place and you wont be disappointed
5,Beef gyros are always good here
5,My daughter and I really enjoy eating here We tend to order the same thing every time because its so good She gets the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo and I get the grilled salmon nicoise salad They both rock Its cafeteria style all the way up to the point you pay then you are served the rest of the way by a waiter who brings you your food and takes care of you The food is always very fresh and delicious And by the time were out of there it costs no more than eating in the food court but the experience and quality of the food are miles beyond Highly recommended
5,"Found the Tuck Shop on my Urban Spoon AP and what a grand surprise it ended up being  
In the heart of Coronado this little house has been transformed to a true Phoenix jewel
The food was amazingwe had pork with a pasta and broccoli  The pork had two amazing sauces that my boyfriend I argued over which was the better  The pasta was okay a bit of a cumin flavor but great once we mixed it with the porks sauce  The broccoli was a great fresh touch  
The manager came over and spent some time talking to us more about the menu and plans to open another place with a different menu soon  A must try if you are a down town kinda person  
The crowd  was a mix of tshirts casual to formal and the patrons ages ranged just as much  The menu changes with the season so go check it out  Only complaint Ive heard from people Ive recommended was the lack of choice if you are a vegetarian"
5,"For a sub shop great place

Delivery is freaky fast for sure  I order delivery half the time

Pros
 fast delivery
 quick service if ordering onsite
 staff friendly
 food is good

Cons
 No WiFi  Would like since ATT service spotty near this building 


Good spot  Glad there is a location here"
1,"Maybe I ate at a different restaurant than the other people or once they got through the soft opening  they gave up because this place was not good

The service was mediocre at best they seemed scattered and unfocused took five minutes to get water  I gave up on ordering anything else after that

The food  Bland hamburger that was cooked perfectly in the center  Too bad that outside of the center inch it was completely overcooked and dry  Soggy duck fat fried and average sweet potato fritters  

Lets talk about this coal oven  While the burgers are cooked in a coal oven you could tell by the smoke hanging over the restaurant they are cooked in an iron skillet ie pan fried  The coal adds absolutely zero to the burger

Overall if I am going to spend 10 on a burger with no sides it better be perfect and this wasnt  I would also hope 5 would get me more than two fritters"
5,"Dining at Roaring Fork was enjoyable The decor is warm and cozy with an upscale vibe Our large group was accommodated for on the patio and since it was happy hour we were quite a demanding bunch  The service was a little slow but all drinks and food came out perfectly 

I had trouble deciding what to order because everything looked so good I split the Big Ass Burger a huge ground chuck patty with cheddar cheese peppered bacon thickcut tomatoes pickles and onions and a kettle of fries with a couple friends I also had the mixed greens salad field greens with candied walnuts and feta with some sort of vinegarette The ahi tuna looked really good as did the fish tacos I also heard raves about the green pork chili 

So many amazing options  a great atmosphereIll definitely be back soon"
5,Amazing food Great date night place with an impressive wine list  Definitely come her again and more often
5,"NEW LOCATION FOR 2012

5,"I am a huge fan of this restaurant I love their locally grown fruits and veggies I love their healthy options I had their brown rice with curry sauce veggies and organic chickenit was incredible Cant wait to travel to Arizona again and return to this wonderful restaurant
PLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA It would be a hit"
5,My daughter began taking classes at Encore 6 years ago  At the time she had a bit of an attitude and didnt do too well with other girls  She instantly fell in love with Regina and took numerous classes from hip hop her first choice to ballet jazz and lyrical  I watched my daughter blossom into an amazing young woman as well as an amazing dancer  Regina involves the girls and boys in the competition experience so that they have more opportunity to learn confidence and self esteem  My daughter has had the opportunity to travel to California and Las Vegas with the studio to participate in Nationals and Master Classes  Encore is not JUST family owned it is a family environment  I checked other studios but found a less than friendly welcome to new participants  I couldnt recommend anything more than Encore and the skills that your child learns  My daughter now works at the studio as well as dancing and my youngest daughter is taking her first classes now  I am looking forward to another 6 years or more with the Encore family
1,Ugh  My tipoff should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good  But I was craving Chinese I work near the COFCO center and it was threatening to rain  I scanned the menu found Kung Pao chicken and ordered up  They told me 5 minutes and they were accurate  Price was reasonable  Waiting area was comfortable and welldecorated  Food was inedible   I got the lunch special which include soup egg roll entree and fortune cookie  I couldnt eat any of it  The soup hot and sour was way too sour  I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it  I couldnt order the fried rice because it contains peas Ive learned to askchildhood trauma  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meatso much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken  I watch too many movies  The egg roll was just gross  It seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deepfried  The fortune cookie was stale and the fortune was even lame  I wouldve done better to get soaking wet and hit up Panda Express
1,"Good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle First of all you have to leave your purse at the counter I am not comfortable doing that anywhere Who does that The only place I have ever seen this before was ASUs bookstore 

Then you walk in this warehouse that has NO air conditioning I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day 111 degrees out yikes Then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes 

If they had ac it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning IN ARIZONA Madness"
1,Heres a thought dont post on the door to your restaraunt Up scale Mexican Food unless you can prove it  This was not upscale it was barely passable  as decent  Didnt help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong  Will not return
5,Great service great food highly recommend  We had the scollops and they were to die for the scotch beef and mac and cheese were also amazing  Will definitely go back and recommend to friends
5,"The Montelucia Resort is home to Crave Cafe and the fact that I was blown away by how beautiful the resort is has nothing to do with how impressed I was with Crave

What are you craving at the moment  Perhaps a cup of coffee  a scoop of gelato  an empanada gourmet pastry  homemade tomato soup  perhaps a panini sandwich filled with turkey cheese  grilled eggplant and cranberry compote red wine magazine fresh fruit Diet Coke

Whatever your craveing  Crave has it all

In addition to pretty much anything your heart desires Crave also has an extremely friendly staff and offers limited seating in and outside with gorgeous views of Camelback mountain

After a full tour of the resort we were hungry for lunch and decided to have a quick bite at Crave We shared a sandwich slice of quiche and tomato soup  all of it was delicious  I am sure Ill be craving a return trip to the Montelucia sometime soon and when I do Im sure Ill pop into Crave for whatever I need at that time"
5,Please excuse this review as I am writing it as I come to from my food coma We just moved to Phoenix and at the time of dining we were not familiar with the Fox Restaurant Group We happened upon CD on accident on a Tuesday night I must say the place was pretty hoppin for an early week night We ordered the pretzels with fondue the fried chicken and the steak It was so good we didnt even speak to each other through the entire sitting It was the kind of meal you dont mind having indigestion after because you get the pleasure of re tasting the deliciousness Gross I know but you know what Im talking about The server we had was as good as a ghost We never wanted for anything but he left us alone I wasnt super crazy about the monkey bread but my honey ate it like we hadnt had a ridiculously large meal 15 minutes before Id kinda like to shave off like a 14 of a star because the staff was ultra trendyIndie as were a majority of the patrons They looked like HM and Urban Outfitters threw up all over them but if thats the gimmick Im ok with it since the food was so amazing
5,"The people at this title company are as good as it gets
They are eager to do a really good job for the agents that use
them  Bill Risser and Paul Guenther are techno pros regarding
the Social Media techniques and readily share their expertise
and time to teach the skills of Twitter Facebook Hootsuite and 
other aspects of Social Media which agents can utilize to serve their clients in a diligent and efficacious manner  The buyers and sellers of  property will really gain by using them because their handling of the transaction will be efficiently and quickly finished"
5,prepare to spend a few hours here and really have a romantic experience the food is divine the service is laid back in a good way the chef runs the whole show and plays all hats the menu is forever changing and when you make a reservation he will ask you questions so he can tailor your meal and experience to your needs probably not a good first date place because if the date goes wrong you will be stuck for a while perfect spot for an anniversary or something or even just to have a nice meal with people you know and care about
5,Hands down the best pizza in the East Valley Tastes like Im back in New York City thats how good the pizza is They do all sorts of combinations and toppings Mmmm mmmm good The hero sandwiches and wings are good too Located in a strip mall next to AMC movie theaters its a great place to go before or after the movies And they deliver too Much better quality than chain pizzerias
5,"If your day is lacking a good decision this place will change the course of your life  at least for an hour

I have only ever ordered the Oggie Im a one pasty kind of guy but most of my friends have had their way with the rest of the menu and it doesnt disappoint

Easily one of my favorite spots in Tempe  Its also a much larger version of its former self so you no longer have to gladly wait an hour for a table"
5,You speak Italian to me and provide mouth watering soul lifting coconut gelato with microchips of chocolate in them  I only wish you werent 30 miles awaybut I would walk in 116 degree heat to get there  for real
5,The place is a hole in the wall right behind the PHX car rental center Arrived at dinner time and had the best Mexican food I had the 5 Machaca Plate wrice beans  one of their homemade tortillas burrito style It was just amazing and so cheap 565 The only issue I have with this place is that its very well used and looks very dirty I did find it a bit sticky Maybe this is a better place for pickup  If you want a clean restaurant their North restaurant on Cactus Road restaurant is much cleaner
5,"Ill be back 

Laura certainly doesnt need my review for help but all of these people are correct  She is meticulous easy to be around and takes joy in her work  When I read all of the 5 star reviews I sort of thought they might be written by friends because they were so gushy  I found her via Yelp and loved her 

20 eyebrow wax takes credit cards"
5,Awesome Mexican food fast service at drive in or sit in and eattry the new fish tacos theyre great and authentic too
1,"I only ask for two things when Im flying To land safely And to not fear planes while on them

US Airways only delivered on one of those and Im still undecided on the first one
Took a flight late from PHX to SFO Two hours isnt too bad Unless of course it was the longest two hours of your life and you could hear people in the cabin praying for their lives
I understand that turbulence is normal But I would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives
Oh and when you finally do land and are thanking your maker that you are in fact still alive its probably best that you dont have to overhear the pilots saying Wow that was scary Im surprised we landed alright
Morons They should pay for the trauma Ill have for the rest of my life"
5,"This my friends is THE place to get some very authentic Chinese food 

The servings are HUGE for what youre payingshucks they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers Who doesnt like leftover Chinese food anyway

My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein You will not be disappointed

Youll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of 4 bucks or so You will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowlit can feed at least 6 people She will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table Give the hot and sour soup a try

As for the service it depends on how you look at it Dont be afraid to get up and refill your own water Shoot the waitress is the only one thats there give her a break already She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop So get your own water and your own take home containers if you want She doesnt have a problem with it

Yes the place is a little worn but you dont go there to look at pretty stuff Its not dirty just broke down Youd be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers Who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies  The lobster crab and fish are fresh and cheap Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound I dare ya 

So head on out just dont go on a Wednesday thats their day off They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though You can call in your order and pick it up if you dont want to look at the place

Oh yeah and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid its not the place its a popular dish that some customers order called Salty Fish It stinks to all heck If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food giggle and finish my meal at home I dont mind one bit thats just the way it is

Oh and the waitress does speak good English however you wont find many Caucasians frequenting this place That means the food is pretty authentic"
5,Two other AC companies were going to charge me double for the same fix  Accutemp has a new customer for life  Highly recommend
5,If you are looking for TLC in very unique pet products and family style customer service Posh Pet Boutique and spaW is where you need to go They have retailed my collection of Decadent Digs there for going on 3 years since the first day she opened her doors I have seen her business blossom and become the destination and extra sunshine of the Troon Area Her loving warmth sort of Doris Day way makes you feel like you are in her home and makes want you to come back often She carries a huge collection of class act merchandise from cute clothes to a killer Kitty highrise and offers excellent grooming She is worth the trip
5,"MMMM THIS IS A TASTY BURGER  Jules Pulp Fiction

I like this place my siblings like this place and its the best thing Ive got to remembering better times back home in California 

Its a quick fix for people who want good burgers at a decent price It always hits the spot when Im feeling like a fatty 

Even considered biking all the way here from my house when my car was dead and going through the drive through Coz the cool kids did it back then In CA anyway haha And employees didnt care
I agree that drive thru is an atrociously long wait during the afternoon after school 
Peeps who work here seem pretty chill since I always ALWAYS ask them for the hats and throw dozens and dozens of ketchup packets in with my togo orders Biiiiiiiiiiig plus"
5,"Fresh  Tasty  Interesting  Good People Watching

Love everything I have tried here  The Happy Hour tapas are excellent  My daughter could not get enough of the garlic chicken one

The 3bean plate is delish  kinda like meatless chili but you dont miss the meat   

The fruit salad is massive and the fruit served with it is completely topnotch

Wait staff is mostly cute college girls which is hardly ever a completely bad thing  Never had a problem with good attentive service which CAN be a problem sometimes

I go eat there as often as is reasonable  Highly Recommended"
1,"I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here I had been to Johnny Rockets before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want 

We get in and I ordered a burger that wasnt the Streamliner 1st mistake and just ordered it with the BOCA burger The waitress takes our order my husband also ordered his with a BOCA 

About 20 minutes later the food comes out The patty looks right I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day but I ignored it It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty over a year so I THOUGHT it looked right 2nd mistake

I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution I immediately start to freak out We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA why does it say Turkey She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey I say no that doesnt sound right So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened Im upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey I mean really I know some people might think how did I not know the difference And I thought that to myself as well but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldnt have And it hurts me every time I think about it I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again if any of them ever again because of this experience 

All I can say is if you are vegan or vegetarian and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets make sure that your waitresswaiter knows that a BOCA burger isnt meat Stress that to them Because obviously they arent trained to know what the difference is"
5,Quality sushi fun ambiance and the chefs there are a blast to talk with Definitely worth a visit
5,Best customer service you can find I buy all of my reptiles and feeders from these guysJames the owner is awesome and very eager to answer any and all questions you havehe will even probe your snakes for freeEvery animal i have bought from them has been in tip top shapeTheir prices are great and the employees are awesomeI suggest them over any and all shops in the east valley including az reptile center and predatorsGive em a shot you will be glad you did
5,"Fantastic restaurant Service was great Food was excellent Their happy hour from 37 is great 300 entrees  Everything from a 12 pound burger to margherita flat bread pizza is just 300  

Amazing appetizer is the shrimp and eggplant in black peppercorn sauce"
1,"Dont know where I should start Grand opening was on September 17th 2010 We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30 off

When I got there the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular Chinese restaurant So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall It just looks too tacky I thought they shouldve went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel California

Upon checking in with the hostess they dont even issue numbers they only call you by name So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things Totally not efficient at all

Once we finally got a seat things got worse

Our Har GowShrimp dumpling was raw The skin was thick and clumpy the shrimp was severely undercooked We asked them to exchange for another one and it was still raw We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food Okso how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food That was probably the lamest excuse

The trademark beef internal organs that I always love to order was pathetic They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon 

The BBQ Pork bun another staple of Dim sum was not that great either There was barely any char siu in the bun and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked

I understand that it is their first operating weekend but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesnt fly in my opinion They even offer wedding banquets here too 

I dont think Ill be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food The idea is definitely novel but will be a hard sell"
5,If you have never been before you should really try harder Your mother taught you better than that Go and buy a smoked pecan paleta
1,We ordered  I had to return my chicken tenders  Undr cooked and rubbery  My wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up  what a horrible experience  We have been huge fans and now this  I called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me  Still waiting My wife is in bed looking so sick  We will never return
1,"Hot BreakfastNOT Again cold food when it supposed to be hotpeople beware of this over price place and lack of care for the customer it seems that this is the way of doing business

 Again a nice place to visit but DO NOT EAT HERE And DO NOT CARE"
5,"I absolutely LOVE Club SAR I joined back in 2010 I think At first I just went there with my ex who lived in So Cal and had been boxing because I have always loved the sport of boxing and wanted to get into it myself maybe even join the boxing team  Sadly I exceeded the age limit to join the boxing team by a few years  
But at least I could still learn and get fit  
We just walked up to the entrance and just took one quick look around and it seemed crowded and small so we were not impressed So we left
I found out this used to be just a boxing gym before but eventually they added other classes and equipment for others to enjoy 

Glad I went back later on my own and found out how affordable it was
I checked and tried a few other Fitness centers and gyms nearby but when I decided to actually try one of Club SARs boxing classes I was hooked For a mere 3  a day dropby fee I was able to get one of the best workouts I ever had I joined after I found out it only cost 75 for the whole YEAR which includes ALL the classes I can take Boxing boxing conditioning Yoga spin class kickboxing weight training MMA Yes MMA too which I personally love    Jonathan  Carlos are great and so is Tom Theyre funny friendly and they actually remember you after only a few classes 
The pricing has gone up this year but it is still by far the BEST possible deal you can find anywhere in the Valley

If you are serious about getting fit staying in shape and getting a good oldfashioned workout without all the posing and pretentiousness of other gyms which are more like meeting places and meat markets for the young Scottsdale wannabes this gym is definitely for you

Personally I recommend the boxing classes because they will kick your butt they are fun get you fit and in shape 
They just got new heavy bags so there are 2 heavy bags 1 hooks bag several Bob bags 2 doubleended bags and 3 speed bags in the main workout areas Plus a bunch more standing weightedbase heavy bags in the other kickboxingYoga room And in case you didnt notice from the picture a fullsize boxing ring 
Yes I am totally endorsing this gym 

PS This is a no frills serious gym 
So no whinnying and crying Suck it up and do some pushups

5,"I had an awesome experience here and highly recommend Dr Dachs He is here to be a good dentist not just to get rich His hygienist was a rock star So nice and very gentle I nearly fell asleep during the cleaning

I found my way to this practice after a horrible experience at another dentist just half a mile away see my review of Belmont Dentistry on Raintree Dr Dachs was just so helpful and reassuring while still maintaining a very high level of professionalism I am very thankful that my second opinion quest led me to him I now finally have a topquality dentist in Scottsdale I can trust

I definitely recommend selecting this practice It may take a little time to get in but its worth it They also work well with insurance"
5,Woohoo is right My hubby and I have gone a few times for happy hour and always enjoyed ourselves Last night was the best so far We were enjoying a few Left Hands and ordered the Tuesday night pizza special It was 2 for 1 basically so we each ordered our fave Apparently the GM thought my pizza was too done so he brought out the  burnt one and already had another one cooking I actually like my pizza that way but hey I could understand where he was coming from The second pizza was beautiful a work of art My husbands pie was great all he kept saying was how great the crust was I wil definitely bring all my friends and clients here Special service too  thanks again to Dan the general manager and our delicious server Reina  sorry there isnt a better wordis there            Linda and Ron
5,"Roka Akor has a classy atmosphere and a slightly formidable menu to pick from Everything looks so good and in a new environment I want to try it all But my date and I after much deliberation decided to go for broke as it were and if we couldnt finish at least we had a good sample of the menu 

 For an appetizer we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad These were yummy little tidbits that disappeared off the plate quickly The butterfish was delicate and the salad was great  the greens had all sorts of different flavors and not that generic clump of lettuce flavor I hate

 From the sushi menu I was feeling adventurous and had never had raw red meat before so I ordered the wagyu gunkan My date saw the amount of green onions piled on top of this dish and ohsochivalrously gave me his piece Its true that you needed a healthy appreciation of green onion to like these as served The wagyu beef is ground nearly to a puree  which I wasnt expecting and I thought the onion was a bit much

 At for the skewers we ordered my date liked his sweet potatoes the best but I was partial to the crispy BBQ These turned out to be two large ovoid and solid shapes of rice run through with a skewer Pure white sushi rice in the center the outside was caramelized with what tasted like the sweet BBQ sauce that comes on eel sushi which gave the whole thing a nice crispy shell

 At this point I got to what I consider to be the crowning achievement of the meal the yuzu marinated black cod The cod cooked on the robata grill in a leaf was meltingly soft and delicately flavored It was an effort to be share fairly I believe my date said after our first taste of it Just eat what you want and Ill finish   I looked up from my chopsticks  you know what Just cut me off half

 I wasnt sure that I could handle dessert after eating so much but we finally decided it wouldnt be fair not to give the dessert menu a looking over right So we ordered the baked green tea custard and it was a perfect pick after a gutbusting meal Light and airy it also had some carbonation to it that tickled my taste buds and made me giggle a lot as I was eating it 

 Our sampler of shochu ranged from impressive to harsh at least to my taste buds In order starting with least harsh pineapple honeycomb raspberry and apple I didnt like the last two but the pineapple was in my mind a fairly dangerous thing to drink when youre not paying attention Smooth

 Thats it for the food and as for the service it was swift and considerate glasses were kept full and empty plates whisked away There was however one glaring exception that nearly overpowered the entire evening with its oddness The waiter who had up till this point been very nice and chatty helpful about menu items and generally a pretty cool guy handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying 

 What am I supposed to do with this Are we going to call our waiter up and say  well what It flummoxed me"
5,"I love this place My gf and I go every time we visit her parents in north scottsdale 

Pros
quick and easy good service clean good food good management not too expensive they also post nutrition info on their menu that alone is laudable 

cons

the salad dressing is quite sharp"
5,This is my favorite restaurant in Tempe The food is great with many vegetarian options The atmosphere is usually pretty quiet and the servers are all nice Highly recommended
5,"This place is everything a sports bar should be Lots and lots of TVsfor one I love being able to watch 4 different sports and play trivia all at the same time

The drink specials are pretty decent Theyre not a dollar or anything but the big beers are cheap on happy hour

The food is great So far Ive only tried the spinach dip wings and their allyoucaneat fish  chips All of them were seriously delicious These types of food are pretty standard in sports bars but Ive definitely had my fair share of unfortunate food items from other places These certainly surpassed my expectations

And last but not least their star of the show Debbie One of the best bartenders Ive ever seen She runs that bar like a champ knows nearly every face that walks through that door and pours great drinks And by great I mean a good stiff drink thats not so strong that you cant taste anything else in it

We frequent this place quite often and for good reason Do yourself a favor and stop in"
5,Sam Sven and all the vendors here make the market special
5,"I am being generous with my review I am biased since this place has been one of my favorite restaurants for years I love it in Georgia and this place continues the tradition of rocking faces off  Italian style 

I went to this locale for my birthday party with about 20 friends unbelievable I know This place was more than accommodating The waitress was fantastic even though we were a pain in the butt come check time I took her suggestions for our family style dinner and not one disappointed I highly recommend the Rigatoni D and Chicken Prosciutto Both were fantastic entrees To top it off we finished out with killer tiramisu 

There is nothing bad I can say for this place The atmosphere is what you would  expect from a large italian restaurant I personally love that their waiting area is also the bar That is just good thinking It truly is a killer place that is perfectly nestled in north Scottsdale I am in love"
5,"I searched hi and lo and had only been able to make good on the very lo with regards to good Chinese food in the Valley  I am VERY picky and I rate most Chinese food places based on the thickness of the membrane of their wonton soup and the colour of their fried rice  Having passed my non doughy and not yellow test  yup people some places give you frozen dumplings versus fresh and yellow Spanish Rice in a Chinese restaurant I was able to look into the quality of their other food items
When you can deliver Mei Fun Singapore style noodles perfectly seasoned with no greasy residue I feel you deserve that illusive fifth star  
Service was pleasant and there was a lot of foot traffic for take away items  I also note that they offered iced Thai tea with cream  My buddy got a plate of broccoli tofu and a wonderful  Kun Pao sauce  Sorry but I think he created it himself and they make everything to order just for food snobs such as we

Hmmmm  I am getting hungry I think  I will go  there now  Wonder if I should get their pepper steak"
5,"So my friend and I went first to Yasu because we heard it was great We were traveling on business and therefore using company plastic So we show up and the kid working the door says in a very Spicollilike voice uh our credit card machine is broken tonight So we replied that we were on expense accounts and would there be any way they could manually run our credit cards The guy replies dude youre outta luck

Funny considering that I am a guy who eats out a lot and am not afraid to spend a lot of money in a place when the food and service is good I wont be going back in there

So we made our way to Hiro We were pissed and hungry after driving around and dealing with idiots all over town Hiro was just what the doctor ordered We sat down and were greeted and served drinks right away We put our sushi order entirely in the hands of our chef who did not disappoint He brought out order after order of fresh delicious sushi and sashimi We had beer sake and a great night When it was said and done we spent about 250 for the two of us which was a lot but well worth it Im sure you could go and have a great meal for much less but we were going big and NOT PAYING  Morale of the story is that Yasus children working that night ran us out and straight to their competition where we will be spending money in the future Go check out Hiro"
5,Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience Definitely go soon
5,This subway is one of the cleanest and most efficient subways I have EVER been to  Ive only been in the evenings but I have to say every time I walk in someone is always cleaning something  Their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins  Sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck Thats what makes this Subway so great Everything is in its place and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work  Absolutely I will go here again and I cant say that about many Subways unfortunately
5,Its not a standard restaurant as it is in the middle of a grocery storebut thats just what it is get over it  The food however is fantastic  I ordered the samosa chaatA samosa covered in chick peas and other sauces and chatney  A delicious Punjabi snack  The portion was very generous and the price cheap  I also recently ordered a dozen samosas to bring home and serve at a dinner party  Very convenient and good service  I will be a regular from now on
5,As one of my fave restaurants in Scottsdale the Herb Box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch At dinner the atmosphere is subtly romantic with string lights illuminating the patio Other than the ambiance the food is some of the best fresh local food Ive tasted A personal favorite is the Free Range Chicken with Goat Cheese Can you say tasty My mouth waters just thinking about it Walking in the crew at the Herb Box is some of the friendliest youll ever meet and the funniest When you go make sure to save room for dessert the cheesecake of the moment is always a win
5,I was referred to Jones Family Dentistry for an emergency procedure I cannot express how incredible the staff and doctors were I appreciate all the time and help they gave me The follow up phone call really showed how caring they are AMAZING Dentists My family has a new dentist Thank you
5,Being from San Antonio I missed Rudys so much This Arizona location is similar but different The BBQ is definitely a winner but their now commercialized packaged BBQ sauce is horrible Bring back the other stuff in the Styrofoam containers I will still keep coming for the brisket when Im in the area
5,"Sunridge Canyon has been one of my very favorite courses since I first played it 6 years ago I have to admit I did work here for a twoyear span several years ago but it was one of my favorites before during and since then

Its not as hyped as Grayhawk Troon and some other courses but its just as great of a layout if not better than some of the more popular highend courses in the valley definitely better than the overrated Grayhawk The course has the rare distinction of being very playable yet very challenging at the same time Youll be toast if you dont hit it fairly straight on most holes but you wont be punished for hitting it where you intended like some of the blindshotheavy courses ie WeKoPa here in the valley Ive shot in the 70s one day and in the 90s the next out there

Besides the superb and scenic layout I also like the simplicity of the overall complex Its not at a big resort there arent multiple courses and there is no grand clubhouse not that all those things are always bad Its just the 18 holes pro shop and a restaurant that serves up some pretty solid food The staff is friendly and helpful too Its like a neighborhood course albeit a highend one 

They have some great summer rates for locals this summer Any day any time for only 35 I recommend all valley golfers to enjoy that rate while it lasts I played yesterday and the course was in good shape teetogreen and outstanding shape on the greens Its been awhile since Ive seen greens roll this well on a 35 course here in town

One last but important note It gets WINDY out here As in it gets windy every day The course plays through a canyon and the winds are swirling all the time An early morning tee time is best since it gives you your best chance to take on the uphill backnine without the wind gusting in your face"
5,"Inside the Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix Gallo Blanco has quickly made a hit for themselves with hipsters and urban dwellers alike They offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants with lively ambiance and great food and drink

Gallo Blancos tacos are surefire hits Theyre served individually and come lined up in an appealing silver taco stand Weve ordered the carne asada and shrimp soft tacos and wow theyre really mouthwatering The shrimp is flame grilled and seared bringing out a nice full flavor The guacamole is slightly sweet and chunky and paired with outstanding tortilla chips this is a mustorder appetizer Even the sauces I prefer the red chipotle one are addictive either to accompany the supreme tacos or to be enjoyed alone on chips

This restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown Phoenix foodie scene and with prices extremely reasonable you get a lot A good sized meal for two sans drinks could ring up at 3035 which is a good value for great food Try Gallo Blanco bring friends and get a bunch of items Although I havent explored the rest of the menu I sense that Gallo Blancos items dont stray far from excellence"
5,"I love pueblo pediatric also  And also surprised there arent any reviews
There staff is always friendly and helpful Rooms are always clean
 I take my baby to Dr Salek He always answers all of our questions and never makes us feel stupid for asking He also takes his time and even asks us how we are doing Most physicians these days are in and out of the room before you can even feel like your questions are answered but Dr Salek really takes his time 
I went in during a very busy dayflu season actually  My baby had a fever and I called the office to fit me in They did surprisingly and I saw Dr Salek He examined my baby and reassured me his fever is fighting off infection and not to worry  Well as any mom I was worried and continued with my questionsI was there for 30 min with him and not once did he make me feel rushed I even thanked him for squeezing us in and he replied we would rather stay later to see all our sick patients than to send you to urgent care because we are overbooked 
Now thats what I call serviceif only MY doctor would fit me in and not send me to urgent care
I havent seen the other physicians but am sure they are just as good Also they are a private practice from what I know so each physician owns part of the practicemeaning they take pride in what they do"
5,"In a never ending quest to find new lunch spots me and a coworker stumbled upon this place Hearing it from another person we were originally looking for somewhere else

Overall I thought the food was excellent A generous portion and a price you cant beat A little difficult to order but got exactly what we wanted Only problem I can see is no where to sit So you have to take it to go Still worth it"
5,"Move over Jacques Torres Angela has come to town and just might be the next big thing for Phoenix and the confectionary world 

I happened to find this place just on a whimI was reminiscing the other day about all the wonderful chocolatiers in other big cities and it occured to me maybe there is a chocolatier in Phoenix  Sure enough there is thanks yelp and shes GOOD 

Angela is as sweet as her candy is She explained how she just started this business in October of last year she is a selftaught talented and creative as authentic as it gets chocolatier She uses all organic ingredients including fairtrade organic chocolate You will find many whimsical truffle flavor creations like Raspberry Rose Mudslide Strawberry Balsamic Lavender Lemonade Madras Curry Avacado Wasabi MapleSmoked Bacon yeah I KNOWand like a million more AND the best news of all is that she says she has perfected a dairyfree recipe for trufflesI CANT WAIT I hope Im the first to order that batch Besides beautiful flavorful truffles she makes her own marshmallows in various amazing flavors as well Chocolate Bark which is always dairyfree and even different hot chocolate mixes 

The most amazing thing of all isnow get ready for thisall of this magic comes right out of her home kitchen THAT means everything is made with love   So if you happen to yelp this like I did the map will actually take you to her business which is located in her house in a neighborhood a little confusing at first but it IS LEGIT She said normally its by appointment only I was not but she gladly had me in and I got to see some of her gastronomic creations anyways yay However she says that she normally sells her stuff at the South Scottsdale Farmers Market Wednesdays and the Tempe Farmers Market on Warner and McClintock on Saturdays In fact if you go to her website you can customize a box of chocolates and pick it up at the farmers market of your choice cant wait to do this

Needless to say this made my dayno like my week SO excited to have a real gourmet chocolatier right in my own neck of the woods Woo hoo"

5,"Just went to this theater last night and it was great  Started with friendly staffevery one of them not common these days  Went to get a popcorn and the nice girl suggestedwhy dont you press your button at your seat and someone will come serve you  Take advantage of the service  We went to our seat and after we pressed the service button someone came within a few minutes  There was a full menu at our fingertipsincluding alcohol and specialty coffees  Our seats were comfortable leather or pleather roomy we could stretch out our legs without touching the chairs in front of us we had 3 cup holders between the both of us and the seats leaned back  Not a bad seat in the theaterwe got to pick our seats BEFORE we went into the movie on a touch screen computerpad  

Im really impressed with the prices too because for just 2 more than a regular cramped loud teenagerinfested movie theater we felt like we were getting First Class treatment all night  The snack food and drink prices are typical for a movie theater but not more than it would be elsewhere  Pretzel was about 450 and Hummus was about 650 for example  

Im sad to read Ruth Anns review because it sounds like an isolated incident and it also sounds like they did a lot to take care of the issues she hadan experience cant be absolutely perfect  In my case there was a little bit of stickiness near my cup holder but thats not something that will bring my experience down an entire star or 3 

Go to this theater  Its really a great night out As long as you like the movie you pick which we did "
5,House special chicken is a must This is not a fancy schmancy place so you know the food will be good Never have had to wait for a table The banana thingies they give you for dessert are awesome too I give it 5 stars because of the huge selection Pei Wei and PF Changs are ok but they have a limited menu And a LARGE wait
1,"Some of my friends brought me here last night and the first thing that came into my mind was that this was a set up for To Catch A Predator I was ready for Chris Hansen to pop out and grill me with What are you doing here If you feel like Kubricks Lolita really speaks to you as in it mirrors your life then youve found a place to feel comfortable in your pervert skin

If youre of age to consume alcohol theyve got a bar here The thing about this bar though is that theyre really sloppy about pouring drinks ie a Manhattan should not taste like a barbers cleaning solution The decor and set up of this place really needs a face lift

A few pluses though If youre under 21 I could see how this would be appealing Ill admit that the under21 clubs that I went to when I was under 21 were fun but now that I think about them they really suck It seems like an alright experience if this is your first step into the clubbar world The DJs here spin pretty much straight hiphop which is fine its very mainstream though and nasty bumping music

If you go here youre one of three types of people

1 You were dragged here by your friends
2 Youre under 21
or 3 Your usual excuse is a heartfelt plea complete with waterworks that goes something along the lines of I swear Officer I thought she was 18"
5,These girls know how to make working out awesome and fun Quality instructors will not disappoint Lots of variety
5,As a Massage therapist I really need to get worked on to make up for all the massages I give  Kristi is my goto massage therapist   With over 20 years of experience in the healing arts shes got amazing strength and sensitivity   ANDshes a great listenerits kind of like getting a counselor and therapist all in one shot  Its the best hour of my week  
5,We made a last minute decision to go out on New Years Eve  The restaurant was very busy but after just a few minutes a couple of seats opened at the bar  our favorite place to sit and the bar tenders Blake Kennan and Clair were ON IT  They were very busy but did not miss a new face at the bar or a glass writing for a refill  The food was excellent My husband had the baseball steak with twice baked potato and I had Prime Rib  with lobster tail and twice baked potato Everything was cooked to perfection Oh yes Start with the garlic cheese bread as it is yummy
5,"Greatness in the form of food just like the other locations 

The service was particularly good at this location We sat at the barand while the other customers were mildly annoying the late night bartenders were up beat witty and very personable

The atmosphere was par for the course

All in all if you are reading this review get your directions to this location close the browser and go eat"
5,"Awesome delicious lunch or dinner takeout place Quite a dive in terms of decor so dont expect anything fancy There are folding tables and chairs if I remember correctly

Anyway I had jade red chicken and emperors chicken quesadilla and both were SO GOOD The idea of Chinese  Latino food sounds odd but Id heard of it before and just never had the chance to try it They have all sorts of combos mostly with beans or rice as a side get it chinese and latin food both usually come with rice So before you knock it if youre in Phoenix and looking for a place to eat this is it"
1,in addition to sucking its also expensive
5,"I cant believe I havent wrote a review for Teds yet By far one of my favorite places to go You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price I normally get a hot dog with mayo onion hot sauce and a pickle I also like the corn dog and onion rings I can always get a satisfying and fulfilling meal for 57 Love it

Can get a little crowded on the weekends but generally all the people are pretty fast and nice"
5,Great place to go before heading to the zoo Not a lot of seating if youre with a big party
5,These guys know their stuff  Professional staff and great location
5,"From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like celebrities I wish I was one after leaving here The food was some of the best Thai weve ever had and I live in Chicago and have tasted dishes more than a dozen different authentic Thai restaurants 

We never were without a glass of water or a full glass of wine I wish I lived here so I could make this a regular stop during my weekly Thai and Sushi cravings 

The Tilapia was out of this world  topped off with a delicious medley of mint onions and lemon leaves I highly recommend the Spring Rolls  very fresh and tasty Give this place a try  you wont be disappointed"
5,Visited this great place last week with my parents and sister and we all had a great time  The service was a bit in the weeds but everyone was friendly and nice and the food was very good  The tour is worth the 5 and then some very informative and our guide was very funny and knew her stuff  products for sale are lovely and the  drive is worthwhile  It is a bit way out but it was different and a great way to spend Sunday  GPS do not like the address so try google maps and your phoneipad it will get you there
5,This place is great  All the food is fresh and always good  They have a great happy hour daily with a very knowledgeable staff  I highly recommend this place
5,Attention all parents nannies guardians etc  Koko bees is tons of fun  The kids are all smiles  full of laughter  Terrific environment  oodles of play houses  dress ups costumes toys themes  settings  The little ones imaginations can run wild  They even offer fantastic dance sports yoga and tumbling classes for the children  This is a great place to come with the kiddos
5,"I split the veggie platter with a friend and we only got just over half way through it  Got the rest to go  I couldnt wait until I had room to eat again so I could eat the leftovers  Sooo much good stuff  Im usually not a glutton but there are a precious few places where I lose all self control and beach myself and this is apparently one of them
We were there for an hour and half and asked all sorts of questions about how things were made and what they were  The lady that waited on us may have been the owner  She was cheerful and happily indulged our questions
Its a large restaurant with plenty of seating for large groups but it also seems to be an authentic family outfit  They have a few beers in bottles and apparently authentic music
Im sad that Im moving out of this neighborhood right as this moved in  If I werent leaving Id probably give up cooking entirely and just eat here every day or try to get takeout
If youre downtown or on the east side of Phoenix its worth the trip  Really good ethnic places outside of the ItalianChineseMexicanAmerican mold are a treasure here in Phoenix  If youre from somewhere more metropolitan you know what Im talking about   West Bring friends dates clients and employees here and impress them"
1,"Our bartender was rude and impersonal to start When my wife ordered a diet coke you could see her disdain We saw her once more when she took our food order after which she sat in the corner and ate The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word and never came back in fact I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out The food was sub par My wifes Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side Also my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce 

Poor food awful service overpriced beer Visit the Kyrene location or dont go at all"
5,Bruce saved my day my computer crashed this morning and I gave him a call and he was able to come out same day  He went through my whole system at my office and even updated my antivirus with a free AVG instead of paying for that crappy Norton service  He was able to go through and recover all my files and found out the operating system was corrupted  He saved my day and completed everything same day  Thank you Bruce
5,"went down to Scottsdale for Spring Training Go Giants and we decided we wanted to have a nice sit down meal instead of bar food or ballpark food every daynight  Eddies House fit the bill perfectly
Food  excellent  Tuna Tartar nachos were great  I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked  Also had a size of Fiddlers Ferns which Ive only tried once before  they were excellent  Berry Cobbler for dessert also excellent  
Service  excellent  very nice waiter who was very attentive
Location  close to downtown but not on the immediate Scottsdale Road path  
Atmosphere  also excellent
Prices  being from San Francisco the prices were unbelievably reasonable"
5,I rented bikes here for the first time today and took them for a ride on the green belt  It was so fun and the husband and wife working the shop were so friendly and helpful I will definitely be a returning customer and recommend this to people who are looking for a fun outdoor activity
5,"Love this spot  its pretty close to the convention center so Natalie and I went here to check it out The bacon is awesome here

Their philosophy is great too  local organic etc etc  The place is tiny and quaint too and as always its great to support a local independent business  

Best breakfast in Phoenix that ive had and definitely one of my fave spots  went there the next day too  got the special and it was delish  check my photos to see what we got"
5,"The name is so misleading because this is the most charming dining spot Ive ever eaten 

I dined here for lunch with a friend and was blown away by everything about it First its location is tucked away near ASU campus in a quiet little neighborhood It appears to be a converted home built in the early 1900s and lots of beautiful mature trees and plants growing in their huge and I mean huge outdoor patio area I only dined outside but honestly with such beautiful weather 9 months out of the year here why would you dine any other way 

The service was excellent The staff was extremely attentive and always checked up on me while I drank water and waited a while for my friend The menu was amazing I never once read a menu that I wanted to try everything on here They had a huge variety of dishes at what I can only describe as AmericanFrench fusion It all looked so divine And from what Ive been told their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes So I cant wait to see what they offer when I return I went simple with my meal having this delicious quiche fresh fruit and a cup of their corn chowder soup The soup was so rich and creamy I could have ordered and ate a whole trough It was that good The fruit was clean well portioned and fresh Im very particular with fruit and hate when the fruit looks soggy and overly ripened And the quiche was heavenly as well Just the right amount of ham and tomatoes with alot of flavor

Since I was here for lunch only the prices were reasonable Ive heard at dinner it can get expensive

This was an unforgettable dining experience and recommend this to everyone to try at least once"
5,"Amazing

Fogo de chao is nothing short of out of this world It is expensive but as soon as you start youll know exactly where that money went
Seriously Try it"
5,Man the chompie sliders is the bomb  Wish there were some in LA  Man taste so good and flavor
5,"The sushi was fresh and excellent The service was almost too fast I did not find the prices to be out of line with the quality  Our daughter loved the miso soup The one thing I really appreciated is that they will make what you want whether it is on the menu or not If they have it you can get it I know well be going there often 

One thing though this is a busy noisy place It is not large either If you are looking for quite and relaxed this perhaps isnt the best choice If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere like a bunch of friends or after work this fits the bill"
5,Great place to take the kids to play and have some bbq Nice outdoor area and good solid bbq
5,"If I won the lottery and just wanted to spend a few hours a week working it would have to be in this store  One because I would want to be there just to see all the THINGS all the time and two because I would be able to spend all my money there  This place rocks

This place has three buildings the west one has pricier items but the stuff is GORGEOUS see previous lotto winning comment  The east one has very reasonably priced items contains seasonal trinkets and specialty food items  The south building has kids stuff pet items and clothingpurses as well as some home items  It is the BEST place to find a gift for someone or spend your overtime check on something nice for yourself 

Want nice stationary  A cute soup tureen  A garden item New collar for your dog Fake fruit for your centerpiece  Gorgeous picture frames  Cute gauzy dress  Hip handbags Pretty bangles  Antique key holders  Whimsical signage Artful platters  Decorative bird cages  Catch my drift  They have EVERYTHING "
1,Worse pizza I have had in a while We ordered 3 slices and they tasted like they had been sitting out for a while and nuked Crappy service too Salad was plain and all oil no vinegar for dressing  Service half ass I am surprised they have remained in business fo several years Also they apparantly have no AC it was VERY warm inside even on a slightly chilly day in Nov so we sat outside the inside was so hot and stuffy this place totally sucks
5,Love the convenience store I stop every morning for a soda on my way to work  They are friendly efficient and clean
5,"I threw my friends bachelorette party here this Sat and had an amazing time Though this place is very fancy and classy they are super laid back with the partying and drinking Makes for a perfect mix We went all out and got a table with bottle service and two rooms to stay in They gave us a bottle of champagne for free and brought it up to the room for us to toast which was cool We had 18 girls in two rooms and we didnt get one complaint We stayed at shade the club upstairs by the pool until 2am and then changed into our swimsuits to go for a dip in the pool I love how the pool never closes so you can drink all night long Shade also plays great music which we loved Good mix of different stuff so everyone was happy

I did have a little bit of issues with the woman who booked our table Her name was Haley She was not very responsive and didnt return my calls emails or texts I wanted to decorate our table but wasnt sure what was allowed and she never answered my questions But the night of the party I mentioned this to the manager and she brought us a free bottle of champagne and sincerely apologized for the trouble This was enough of a redemption for us It couldnt have went better Thank you W for an awesome and memorable night"
5,"a weekend of debauchery was spent here when i was 18  somehow we broke two lamps that were hanging on the walls  like high up on the walls  like above head level  dont ask because i dont remember how it happened either  we tried to steal lamps from other rooms but the maids kept catching us  so we wrote I O U 2 LAMPS  on one of the lampshades and left it at that  one night my friend jonathan got really drunk and angry and lonely went to the pool and threw all of the poolside furniture into the pool  we seriously destroyed that motel  im not kidding there was so much filth in one of our rooms that you couldnt see the carpet  i felt really really bad for whoever had to clean that up  but the best part was that we didnt get charged for any damage we caused  thanks motel 6

no wonder my useful points are so low i use yelp more often to showcase my anecdotes than to actually review things  im useless"
1,"I just finished my G  S meal that I ordered togo actually I just finished throwing it out It was HORRIBLE And by horrible I mean shamefully bad And by shamefully bad I mean heinous I had a very disappointing experience here about a year ago but I thought I would give it another try I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the longterm employees at the neighboring Blockbuster what was good and to the person they all stammered and failed to reply Seriously zero out of four could give me one great dish Ive lived in both Mpls  Chicago and my Ex used to travel the Orient and we were always surprised at how POOR the quality of Asian food was in this area and WHY the people here seemed to like it Its absolutely baffling
I had the Orange Beef  Spring Rolls The Orange Beef looked scarey right in the container But when i ate it  UGH The texture was all off and the sauce it had these big clear GELATINOUS  ugh ugh ugh I cant even talk about it Like biting into a ball of cornstarchy orange extract Im still sick from those few bites Truly And while I ordered vegetable spring rolls I got what tasted like lowquality hamburger meat In fact I finally identified the flavor and texture as SAUSAGE It was like an Asian Spring Roll with chunks of Italian Sausage inside Hows that for a combo Ugh stomach turning
Im sorry Im a Single Parent and Im usually grateful to have someone cook for me Grateful even when i am paying But during tough times when i actually treat myself and then plunk down 20 for unedible yuck  its totally TOTALLY unacceptable 
Shame on you George for offering such little quality control and not aspiring to a higher standard overall No wonder the place was not hopping on a Saturday night
Simply one of the worst meals EVER"
1,"NOTE This review concerns the Robertos on Union Hills and 7th Ave NOT the Robertos in Anthem


I am only giving it one star because I cant give it 0 Simply put i was very sick after dining there recently This was the only meal I did not share with my family and therefor the only culprit to my food borne illness I have enjoyed this place in the past but recently the quality has gone downhill Now they are closed on Sundays

I wish i had read recent reviews on here before i had gone they have slipped VERY far since there Diners Driveins and Dives days 

the guy that both took my order and cooked my food was obviously drunk sitting on his cellphone playing what appeared to be a video game when i walked in"
1,"After stepping off the plane hungry I looked around the terminal for food as I walked to the next gate Wait a minute Im in Arizona I should get some southwestern style food or mexican food Is that a burrito place Surely it cant be bad I ordered a 1 standard burrito I take a bite And another Not bad I thought Then I took another bite And promptly spit it out

The cheddar cheese in my burrito was moldy And no Im sure it wasnt blue cheese It was even obvious visually After pointing the cheese out to the manager she brushed it off as the bag was just opened its not possible even after showing the obvious mold People around me started looking uncomfortable Someone muttered wow and stepped out of the line

The best part I wasnt even offered a refund or a new burrito or an apology for the moldy burrito Are you kidding me"
1,I used to love Quiznos I would go out of my way to get a turkey bacon guacamole sandwich any day At this point in my life I will no long be giving any money to this sorry excuse for a sandwich shop The staff is rude and careless I was given obviously bad guacamole Which I didnt realize until i got home a took a bite of my sandwich to have the fowl taste in my mouth It took 20 mins to get my sandwich there was only one couple in front me Im done with this place I should have went to paradise bakery across the street
5,"If youre willing to run out for lunch a little early enjoy the lively patio atmosphere will dining on yummy vittles
A WhenHarryMetSally picky eater I um grilled the waiter on seafoods sustainability and ingredient origin and he was goodnatured and knowledgeable
A perfect eatery for a casual date or girls day out 
Yay"
1,"MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED  Ive been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations  for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE  Mimis in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations  On Oct 26th while visiting the area I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimis because of previously good food and service there  But alas if the old Mimis quality still existed they wouldnt have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant

Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE except those people you truly dislike should never patronize this facility  First of all the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees when it was less than 65 outside  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on

Next we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer  It looked funny  It tasted funny  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips  If it walks like a duck quacks like a duck it must be a 

I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with seasonal vegetables and homemade mashed potatoes  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle  Thats a feat  My homemade mashed potatoes  Cold  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress the problem   Even after this effort no offer from the wait staff or managermissinginaction was ever made to either warm up the potatoes replace them or perhaps use them as wall spackling

After all this they sincerely asked us if everything was all right and would we care to order dessert  At least they have a sense of humor

Never again"
5,"A philosophical elder of my profession commonly says Everyone needs three vices  Sex and chocolate dont count  

If I still lived in Phoenix LoLos Chicken and Waffles would definitely be one of my vices  The chicken is pure fried goodness The mac ncheese is creamy and crispy goodness The waffles are BEYOND DELICIOUS  

If I could give any future LoLos consumers a hint it would be this if you are sensitive to too much sugar like I am dont waste your precious pancreatic islets on the beverages  I succumbed to the peerpressure and got an Arnold Palmer which of course comes in a quartsized Mason jar  I reached my sugar capacity before the meal even started  I can only imagine the explosion of flavor in my mouth I would have experienced had I not wasted all my buds on sweetened tea and lemonade"
5,Yum  The toasted barley app is delicious My boyfriend and I shared the eggplant sandwich and the monk burger Both of the sandwiches were outstanding The service was great too We will definitely go back
5,I am giving this location 5 stars cause its been my stomping grounds for atleast 12 years now its always very good clean and I have never had a bad experience here Wendys locations are just class acts they are always my go to burger fix I also made this my daughters first burger when she wanted to finally try one so she could have a good experience for the first one and always have a tasty burger to judge the rest by for her life If its good enough for my daughter then its good enough for you  eat up and review
1,"The location has closed AGAIN  Not good if you have prepaid washes or other credits as the business has closed  Some speculation on other sites is that they have filed for bankruptcy again

Dont bother stopping by to use their services as the facility is cordoned off and a big sign says business closed"
5,I think this is the best fast mexican food in Chandler or the surrounding area  The food quality is high and consistant  The prices are downright CHEAP  I really like the bean and cheese burritos and the chili relleno burritos  The jalapenos and carrots are a must and I am thrilled that they started selling Tamarindo
5,Best pasta I have ever had Dont go there if youre looking for a twopound chicken parm or endless breadticks
5,"This is my new addiction Took some friends and family here to celebrate my moms birthday it was her first time and she had a blast 

Our first chef Poncho isnt at this location any more which we were disappointed about but ended up having another great chef named Sam He was funny and the food was great I tried grilled shrimp for the first time and I am a fan 

Our waitress was awesome On top of everything funny and she told us Sam was the head chef and that it was an honor to have him cook our food and that she was so glad we got him seeing that it was the first time for almost everyone in our group to try a place like this

We have also had dinner on the patio when it was cooler out and enjoyed it too I will be eating here often

Thanks Hayashi for always making my dining experience fun and delicious"
5,This is the only work of his that I have seen in person After living in the valley since 2002 I FINALLY decided to head out that way  I found the information about the life and times of Frank Lloyd and his 3rd wife very interesting The house was amazing and beautiful I especially loved the local rocks cast into the concrete and the lines that created a flow   I would highly recommend this tour to any one with an interest in form function and beauty
1,"First off the woman who answers the phone is not impressive at all   I called to consign my furniture and when I asked her about some info on the store she said  do you want to consign your table or not  Quite rude  That was a turn of for me
The next day I went in the store for some info but when I entered I knew this wasnt the right fit for my Robb  Stucky table  The place had older style furnituredated couches florals mauves  There was one accessory that I would  buy in the whole store  

Needless to say I wont be coming back or consigning my table or anything elserude stuff  gross stuffwhat more can I say"
5,I love Gabriel He does an amazing job every single time Im there I generally get two peekaboo highlights put in and a cut and style and always leaving looking great His attitude is always upbeat it would be impossible to spend any time in his chair and not leave in a good mood The salon is always clean and comfortable I never feel like Im being forced into spending more money or buying product but when I have a question about what I should be using in my hair Gabe always makes excellent suggestions I have recommended him a good friend and my mother and both love him My mother even left her stylist of 10 years to start going to him because of the excellent service he provides
5,"If you want a good meal that will fill ya up for a fair priceWallys is a great choice

The menu has great variety  If you want a burger there are many to choose from  Each is huge and juicy and comes with your choice of a sidego with the blended fries that include deliciious sweet potato fries

Want a salad  Again many to choose frommy favorite is the chinese chicken  And in case you missed my earlier comments expect a BIG salad

And if youre not watching your calories then try any of their specialty macncheese dishes  WOW

I cant comment on the desserts because I cant eat anything beyond the entreesbut Ive seen others order a dessert they looked yummy and  you guessed it  HUGE

And heres the thing about Wallys  theyre good people  in addition to providing you with a great meal Wallys staff are active supporters of nonprofit organizations in the greater Phoenix area  I have firsthand knowledge of their support for the Valley of the Sun Unted Way and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Scottsdale  I have no doubt they support other causes"
5,"Drinking coffee from Cartel makes me want to get my own San Franciscan SF25B Coffee Roaster in much the same way I wanted my own pottery wheel after seeing the movie Ghost

Its That Good"
5,"At length A trip to Kauai for our friends wedding several years back led us to Puka Dog and the discovery of another type of holy matrimony the perfect union of frankfurters and tropical fruit Our friends are still together eight years later but how my hot dogs have longed for the companionship of a little pineapple and banana relish

Disconsolate from my long lost love I have abstained from the hot dog community except for Teds because its amazing and what happens in Tempe stays in Tempe until a new beau arrived Maui Dog

In short ish Yummy yummy yummy Ive got Maui Dog in my tummy I tried the Sweet  Spicy Dog favorite and the Lava Dog messy and the house made fries Everything was delish and Ill be back to try the rest The restaurant is a cute clean pseudodive kind of a Two Hippies vibe with a few tables inside and a dogfriendly patio teehee Its funky and its affordable Go ahead try it You just might fall in love"
5,The service here was wonderful really friendly and personable And the food was OUTSTANDING That Brulee burger was perfection paired with some fries and a marshmallow shake I wanted to stay in town another day just to come back here to eat
5,Best sushi in town
1,I have only been going to LA Fitness for about 6 months I live in Scottsdale and work in Phoenix so I go to the 20th St  Camelback Scottsdale and Oak and McCormick Ranch locations  The Scottsdale locations are GREAT They are clean the staff is really nice and I see people cleaning the equipment when they are done  What is it with the Camelback crowd  The place really smells bad It really needs a good cleaning There has been this big spot on the carpet in front of the womens locker room since I started  I was on the treadmill the other day really noticing how stinky it was and then the guy next to me finished up and just walked off I swear he was sweating like a pig left the equipment drenched UGH  Good God I couldnt believe it Cant the employees make these people clean after themselves The reviews are right about the staff just hanging around at the front deskthey should be cleaning something anything  It really is a shame that this centrally located facility is a real stinky mess  I cant wait for the new one to open on 7th Avenue Maybe then they may clean up their act
1,Ok Im very surprised by the reviews on here Im not one to want to write negative  reviews but our food was so bad I couldnt help myself Maybe this place was having an off night tonight but their pizza barely had any cheese on it and the crust was soggy Unfortunately the pizza was better than the wings that were overly breaded and soggy as well Thank God we had a groupon and didnt have to pay full price Wont be ordering from here again Disappointing 
5,Be sure to see Taylor her service is great the food is awesome had roast beef sandwich and a plank of bruschetta  But without good service the experience lacks Be sure to try it out
5,"I am a huge foodie from a long line of foodies I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining This is the best very best breakfast restaurant EVER I have been living in Tempe for about six years now the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existedafter my first visit this is my goto best place to recommend favorite breakfast place to eat at If you go on a Sunday it will be very very busy Everyone is super friendly The place is very clean Prices are amazing Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food Huge portions and great quality food I have never had a bad experience here and to be honesteven if I did I wouldnt care I feel like home here Everything on the menu is delicious Ive tried almost everything Here are a few of my favorites dont forget though I love it all 
OPear Grenache Omelette Greek Fetash Omelette English Harvest Omelette Huevos Con Chorizo with scrambled eggs and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes pancakes you can order half an order or little oneswe always get an order to share at the table Their potatoes are delicious and crispy the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts Just delicious I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret DONT LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A 5 STAR This place is the best bottom line Try it You will be hooked"
5,"It is sometimes difficult to start out busy and maintain great standards from the beginning  The Parlor seems to be nailing it  Hip yet comfortable decor   Very creative design and I loved he subtle yet present homage to the former tenant Salon de Venus  As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm and sincere smile and that same enthusiasm was felt by every single staff member we encountered  
Ah the food  Fresh ingredients a great light pizza crust and an original beet salad all  had us raving   The only minor picky foody issue was the Nectarine Crustada for dessert was luke warm at best would have liked a nice hot dish to melt that delicious ice cream  

But why nit pic  This place is a big hit from the moment you walk past the fresh herb and vegetable garden  to the fantastic staff and the  savory food this place is already on my regular rotation"
5,"We were staying at the Claredon and the desk clerk who is also from Yuma told us that their restaurant was voted best Mex in Phoenix and she swore it was true so we had to try it

The elote roasted corn with cheese and smokey paprika was fab as was the ceviche The carne asasda taco was tasty as so many have already said The real stars however were the pork belly and vegie tacos Ill be dreaming about those til our next trip north"
5,"Everytime I think of Chodang my mouth waters I love the spicy tofu soup they serve here along with their korean style dumplings Their portions are just right If you dont like spicy foods you can tell them to not make it spicy I also love the condiments they serve before the meal Love it

I like their decor The tables and walls really go together and you definitely feel like youre at an asian restaurant Everything is neat and clean even the bathrooms"
5,"I love this place Ive been here twice now and walked out with great finds both times They have a large variety of clothes  workappropriate  fun cocktail dresses fabulous shoes jewelry casual skirts and shirts and more The employees are very friendly and helpful 

Another reviewer mentioned 700 boots but I havent seen a single item priced over 100  I actually got gifts for my cousins 2 hair and jewelry items apiece for under 20 per person and in the same visit found a dress for less than 40 that got me half a dozen compliments at a holiday party that night"
5,"After weeks of anticipation Side Bar has finally opened  As you ascend the staircase to the second level the reason for the long wait becomes apparent  The attention to detail is amazing  Once layered with crumbling plaster the walls were meticulously stripped to reveal the historic brickwork  Other historic elements include the original steel casement windows that feature a view of downtown phoenix and the surrounding area Tastefully integrated with these elements is a contemporary interior design  The lighting consists of warm colors that set the stage for the laid back atmosphere  No expense was spared when designing the bar and tables which are made of dark exotic woods  Seating included organically shaped bar stools that adjust to a comfortable height and depth  There are also several ushaped sofas that create conversational areas  Behind the bar youll see an array of artistically arranged circular openings backlit in a warm yellow tone  Thick glass shelving lines the back wall along with a fine assortment of liquors  The soft opening menu included wines and locally brewed beers among others  I tried a White Russian and my wife had a glass of Chardonnay  Both were very good  Prices seemed to be close to average for the area and when compared to the experience were a good value  I had a chance to speak to one of the owners who was glowing with excitement  After two years of remodeling and working with the city and adjacent historic neighborhood his vision has become reality  In addition to a brief history of his endeavor the owner informed me that additional overflow parking will be available adjacent to the main parking lot  Parking was one concern originally voiced by the neighborhood and city  The owners may also experiment with weekly art showings by local artists  Maybe they can arrange for it to coincide with First Fridays  Within walking distance of Side Bar dining includes Pei Wei My Florist and Zoes Kitchen   
If youre looking for a unique hangout in an urban setting then Side Bar comes highly recommended"
5,Went to Cracker Barrel twice while vacationing at our home in Litchfield Park  All the food we ordered were very good and the service was good also  I highly recommend their pancakes
5,"Grassroots is right around the corner and we drive by it every week on our usual FridayDinnerOut  I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant  My wife and I arrived around 500pm and were seated immediately  The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about  

We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata with ciabatta tips their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette  It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes  The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese  The play of flavors in this dish was excellent wed go back here just for this dish alone

My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor  I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side but it didnt come with it by default

I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits  The ribs were cooked just right just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top  The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor As others have mentioned the jalapeno grits are very good not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces creamy and well prepared  I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone

We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split  The split included three large scoops of what appeared to be homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans  The key lime was tart and delicious

The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate  Its a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows

 I didnt know what burrata was httpenwikipediaorgwikiBurrata"
5,"This is my love note

Yours beers are so delicious your food is absolutely scrumptious  I wish I could spend forever and always with you  If I could just never work and sit inside of you all day eating and drinking why I think I would be the happiest gal on this side of the Mississippi River  You are great dont change and please stay with me forever and always

I love you to the moon and the stars Handlebar

1,This location is now closed
5,I stayed at the Motel right across the street from this restaurant when I stayed in Gila Bend I had been driving all day through the hot desert and really wanted to kick back with a cold beer and some good food Little Italy did not disappoint I got a large pizza that was AMAZING Plus the service was great too Fast and friendly
5,Chef Bianco does it again The homemade pasta is unreal You can actually taste the freshness of all of the ingredients The pasta is thick like homemade pasta is supposed to be but not heavy at all I also loved the casual vibe and the staff was very friendly and nice You really feel like a guest sitting in the kitchen in a home somewhere in Italy
1,"Why cant the attendant understand a simple direct question

5,I cant believe we get to review a free publication  Nonetheless its important to know especially for Dave B who obviously didnt do his research that this magazine is published by a gentleman who grew up here in the valley and wanted a way to promote all of the great creative people and activities they are doing by making a free magazine  He decided this 17 years ago and despite pretty much breaking even it costs money to print and distribute thousands of magazines and no the ads do not cover the full cost continues doing so in the name of cultural awareness  Notice that the photoshoots use local designers local models local photographers and local locations  The articles are about artwork currently displayed in local galleries businesses like restaurants and bands that local folks have started on their own from meager means and about upandcoming events like the taco festival started by a local fashion shows again utilizing local designers and run by locals  no Dillards show coverage here and about people in the valley who are trying to make a difference in our community  If the magazine doesnt seem critical enough its because the people who are the magazine decide what to write about and therefore dont have to waste pages with hateful criticism when Java can be promoting a local chef or a cool new local jewelry designer  When its run by a local written by locals and put together in the publishers dining room I cant think of any magazine with MORE credibiilty and freedom  The publisher and writers are meticulous in choosing to write about what moves them rather than what the latest hype is  Thats why you read a story about the man who purchased a building and was designing it into a venue before it was the Crescent Ballroom  Thats also why youll read the backstory on five locally owned littleknown coffee houses at far ends of the valley  The candid shots in the back are a tribute to local events the publisher attended but maybe an article hasnt been written about or to local artists designers or patrons of the arts  While its always interesting to hear what people think of Java knowing what really goes on behind the scenes gives me nothing but respect for the handful of folks to who put their blood sweat and tears into creating this free publication each month
5,This place was AMAZING  I have stayed in probably over 100 hotels this one was the BEST hotel I have ever been to staff was extremely friendly I WILL be back
1,Overcrowded sprawling mess of a mall and I normally like malls Traffic and parking are almost as bad as at Tempe Marketplace The confusing layout makes it hard to find specific stores even with the help of the directories
5,Finally had a chance to watch a game here Just moved to Surprise in July and have been waiting for spring training Very easy parking and the seats are great It does not matter where you sit The diner have great food I will be coming here a lot
5,Amanda was very helpful when we looking at the ferrits   A great pet store
1,The bill was 15000 and that was after a free appetizer coupon they sent me via email  The food was no where near worth the HIGH price  The service was not up to par either  I really cant believe people pay such high prices for food that come with NO sides etc  I got iced tea to drink and it cost a whopping 600  Thats right folks600 for a glass of tea  What is that 100 profitmark up  I paid 1200 for a soup sampler  Each of the three soups were in a tiny espresso cup  My salmon was no better than what I get at Texas roadhouse but it was three times the price  I would definitely not recommended this place  If you want a fancy awesome meal go to Houstons  The one thing that was great were the rolls they were free too  Dont get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag  You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper
5,"Well thoughtthrough details make Lux amazeballs 

The espresso is good Really good Like I need to order an espresso along with whatever else Im ordering just because it is so delicious 

The food is beautifully presented little light on the gluten free snacks but theres fruit so no one is starving 

Theres plugs all over

The furniture is mostly easy to wipe down

The bathroom door has written out instructions so no one is confused on when the door is locked It also has nice smelling soap 

The patio is really pretty

The clientele seems ridiculously cool I kind of feel like maybe Im going to be cooler by association if I hang out here IM GIVING IT A GO Let me know how Im doing"
5,The best Burgers in Town  I have been hooked on their yummy burgers since the first bite  I used to always drive by this place and notice that the parking lot was always packedand no wonder they are Wonderful  Their custards are extremely yummy too   Worth the drive from North Scottsdale  I havent tried anything else off their menu besides the burgers custard and fries  Always tell myself that I will next time but when the time comes I just cant pass up my favs 
5,"AMC Esplanade is by far the most successful navigator of the new Dinner and a Movie blue ocean the theater industry is starting to penetrate thats right I just referenced Blue Ocean Strategy get over it  No its not an extremely enlightened idea Ive been sneaking Bacardi into theaters since 2003 so its about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it but AMC really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from THEM but also upgraded chairs and a ton of delicious food Including the obligatory 4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a 9 burger Like Dont mind this 9 full meal over here we still stand firm that Gummi Bears are worth their weight in gold

Yes its more expensive than a regular ticket Almost double for the nice seats But trust me YOU WANT THOSE SEATS You will regret not getting the 15 seats if you dont buy the 15 seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home 

This theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable I saw The Master here and probably would have stabbed myself in the eye with my embezzled Bacardi flask if I didnt have a comfy recliner and three glasses of wine to get me through it I seriously wont go to a movie anywhere else and I guarantee youll say the same once you go FIVE STARS"
1,One star for the most terrible service in recent memory  Our server DK was outright rude and horrible and outright ignored us when she wasnt making us uncomfortable   As a former waitress of 14 years I have the utmost respect patience and tolerance for my former bretheren  but this woman needs to go  BAD DK  Otherwise our Teppiniyaki sp chef was wonderful the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars  I have been going to Kyoto since 1995 and it remains a fun and festive place with very reasonable prices  Too bad it was ruined this time by DK   DK needs a different job more suited to her personallity like euthanizing kittens or something
1,"Entering the store is visually overwhelming There were so many things take in I thought Id found my new grocery store 
I wandered for a good 40 mins checking everything out 
After the ether wore I began to realize something While the selection was wide it look OLD 
I raced to the fresh fish and noticed that even packed in ice their little fish eyeballs where cloudy and sunken into the sockets 
I looked at the frozen section and found some fish that had a sell by date of 022010 There was other fish that was packed by the store  with no packed on or sell by dates There was canned and boxed food past their expiration date 
I checked out this place on the Maricopa County health department and they had their fare share of customer complaint driven inspections"
5,"I have no idea why I havent dined or noshed during happy hour at this place more often Ive always had great service great wine and great food There is no adequate excuse  but anyway my third adventure here made me update my review to 5 stars because 5th and Wine has earned it

The wines by the glass range from 8  11 unless you come in before 6pm then they are only 5 Those prices alone should make you want to come here for drinks with friends The servers have always been cool with offering samples if you cant make up your own mind between two wines despite the recommendation from the server and your friend saying just pick one Due to this fact Ive always had a glass that I have enjoyed which is usually a Zinfandel 

I have now had the pleasure of experiencing all of their different types of bruschetta My top two favorites are the Prosciutto Mascarpone Figs and Tomato Jam which has a great combination of salty and sweet and the Apples Brie and Fig Jam one which is on the sweeter side but not overwhelming because the bread and the tart granny smith apple slices help balance out the flavor The Chopped Salad is very light and refreshing option to accompany the brushcetta appetizer 5th and Wine is also a restaurant so other food options are available I have sampled the Chicken and Pesto Pasta which has a delicious cream sauce and their Mac  Cheese which is super rich with the two types of melted cheese but both items are delicious

The atmosphere is great whether you are sitting inside or outside The lighting is soft giving more of an intimate feel yet this place still remains simple and casual which I love The outside patio is great it is a courtyard that offers peeks into store windows while remaining private from the traffic of Old Town The times I have been here it has never been super crowded and I am able to just walk in and be seated right away 5th and Wine still feels like a hidden gem and you must try it out"
5,Havent been to a Vietnamese restaurant since I left Colorado almost three years ago But for what its worth this is the best most authentic Vietnamese cuisine Ive had so far 
1,Slow service staff needs more training Theres like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing i dont think this place is going to make it Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service
5,"Had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend We both got The Farmers Feast and it was truly amazing I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food though the hubby didnt really share too much I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here 

The antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses Next I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet Strawberries arugula radishes yum For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam His dish was amazing I had to fight for a couple bites For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef just lucky we each got our favorite meats Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves For dessert I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing One of the best deserts I have ever eaten Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey Just fantastic The hubby got bread pudding which we didnt much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didnt try I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option Also it ended up that you got a half glass at least with each course so I think it is a good value the wine pairing was an extra 45 

I do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much However I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all Our server was extremely warm and friendly She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow however I believe that this is intentional They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself With the Farmers Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end it is six courses after all or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine It was pure food heaven This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event when you come here this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough  We truly had fantastic night here

One warning I will say is for ladies you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels I had been warned so had wedges In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite special occasion restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber"
5,Good service and good food I ordered the burger sliders for lunch without the 1000 island dressing and loved them A quick little meal for those on the go The attendant even offered me a nice tall glass of ice water to go while I was waiting
5,Ive been a regular here the past 3 years Other than the wait being long the five spot sandwhich and waffle make this place one of my favorite in the nation
5,Barb at Tees and More does a great job  They provided our company shirts and did a perfect job  Fast service great service and great people
5,"Mid size American airport with very good organization very straight forward no hassle 

Security is a little slow and priority lane isnt really priority its more of lets make fun of first class flyers getting pissed lane so lets welcome first class flyers with big giggle 

Many stores and food quality is okay Seating areas are limited at least for the Terminal 3 before security so be aware 

Lots of volunteers working here to guide you to the right place there may be more volunteers than passengers Haha"
5,"I did not know I could still be creative since it had been years since I had done anything that involves even a minor level of creativity
But what fun was this

A girl friend took initiative here to organize a kitchen tea on a recent Saturday afternoon We were a table of 6 girl friends that were scheduled for some pottery making 

My initial idea of this venue was admittedly a little different but better than expected in so many ways

For one we did not have to get all that dirty Not dirty at all really Also not that I mind dirty This is for those who wonder whether to go or not to go

And two  we were able to bring along our own food and drinks which made for excellent responsibility sharing in the wining and dining arena

Once we were set up with our party arrangements and have had some snacks and champagne we were inspired to start our artistic journey The idea was to have each of the 6 friends make a dinner plate or item of the bride to bes choice which we will then give to her as a wedding present I thought this idea was really original

So the bride to be selected her dinner plates of choice after which we were briefed by a very friendly and sweet staff member as to the different effects that the paint will have once the plates were baked All informed we went to select the different colors we needed for our different art works

Everybody started painting and each one of us got really involved with their own creation The event took us much longer than we anticipated but in such a good way We finished about 4 hours after starting off but much enlightened by the activity

Everybody agreed that we will have to go here again for the sheer enjoyment and good feeling of togetherness it promoted I have not yet seen the end product as one of our friends went to pick up our designs  but we will presenting our collective gift to the bride to be soon 

Go go here for a stimulating outing with good friendsfamilykids"
5,"Stingray Sushi is where we go for sushi 

Sleek beautiful interior and very very clean  This dining house has large 13 or so foot doors that when open seamlessly link the patio potion with the interior dining area a very good design flowindeed The patio itself is very comfortable as it has great seating 
The service has always been wonderful the sushi very fresh with beautiful presentation We like to get the sushi boat  edamame and beef yakitoriThe fire dragon rolls though on the small side are also yummy

Drinks are very good here the sinful orchid yuma very pretty drink And their HH is really good as well "
1,Waffle House was packed Over heard another couple taking about Fast Eddies With a 20 min wait ahead of us we decided to try it out Walked in looked like a senior center Tables and chairs were very out dated We sat down in a booth Food was still on the table and the cushions were dirty Waitress came over after 10 min and asked what we wanted to drink 10 min later she brought out or coffee Placed the order waited another 20 min to get the food The diner wasnt busy at all I dont know why the wait was so long The food was ok service was horrible One thing that really grossed me out was the ac return next to the office door Look up and you will see probably years of dust that has collected I showed the waitress and she really didnt care I told her that if I would of saw that when I came in I would of just walked out GROSS Sorry Waffle House I will never betray you again
1,"This place has the oiliest food Ive ever eaten in my life  I had carry out one evening two dishes and the entrees were soaked in oil  I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach  I wish I couldve washed the other dish too but it wasnt one that could be washedit was a widerice noodle dish

Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too

Really not sure what the fuss is about"
5,"If its an emergency they will generally see you asap  When we used to live in Desert Ridge we had 2 dogs 2 cats there were times when I needed a vet immediately and generally they will accommodate you in such a demise  They see you pretty efficiently but of course they will suggest things that I feel are not merited to add onto a bill but its your right to question their additions and refuse of course  Ive never found them to be arrogant or pushy they will easily offer other options or be ok with your decision

During 1 extremely difficult period with our beloved RottieSheppard Mix they were very understanding to the emotional distress we were experiencing with regards to his advancing old age  he was 17  They were happy to provided us with care during his aging  Sadly it came to a point that his quality of life was no longer conducive to allowing him to continue in the state he was and it when it came to making the horrible and very sad decision to allow them to put him down the entire staff were so understanding caring and totally sympathetic to our demise  They allowed us to hold him cradle him and pet him the whole time  We were allowed as much time as we wanted before during and after the whole lifealtering circumstance  They even sent us a sympathy card signed by all the staff after the terrible ordeal we went through

During another trying experience we had to endure our boxer mix was attacked by another dog and needed emergency care  We were now closer and under the care of the TatumShea location but they were unable to see us  This location was able to open up their schedule to see us under this distressing circumstance  They provided expert care and glad to say that he mended just fine with no lasting illeffects"
5,"I am not a connoisseur of cupcakes so I dont have a ton of references to use on this review That being said Im not really a big fan of cupcakes either This place is family owned and operated Theres a wife and husband who run the place and the wifes sister works there also which I thought was great It is in the strip mall towards the western end of the shopping center

I tried a variety of the flavors including the Reese Withaspoon and a chocolate chocolate chip cupcake Coworkers that I shared them with who are cupcake aficionados really enjoyed the lemon and red velvet versions While slight pricey for a cupcake slightly north of 2 per cupcake if you have a special occasion or just want a special treat these cupcakes are incredibly moist and delicious They also do custom cakes and cake pops though I cant speak to either of the latter two"
5,"So much food for so little money and they have kids meals that the kids will actually eat  If you do not like what they offer in the cafeteria you can get food downstairs like Pizza and hotdogswhat kid does not like Pizza or a hotdog

I had the meatballs and mashed potatoes and they were so good  I wish there was something bad to say about eating in a furniture store cafeteria but there really is not  it was great food great service and fun for the kids there is a play area with a TV that they can eat at too so the parents can enjoy their food too

My wife had the herb chicken and it looked great too and she said it was really tasty too  She loved it  The desserts were amazing too and very filling  SO MUCH FOOD for SO LITTLE THE MONEY

I wish it was not so far away from Queen Creek or I would hit it up so much more often"
5,"Imagine for a minute that youre waiting in a really long line No its not the line ride You see a menu on the wall with your ordering options but before you are anywhere near someone that could take your order youre yelled at

Hey What do you want

Dont be afraid but dont be surprised either Keep your cool and order your dogs Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings onion rings and be prepared for when youre called upon again Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food

Never fear though because it is amazing Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs youll ever have My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst Whenever I know Im going I end up salivating like Pavlovs dog for hours

The booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at One started a whole conversation and research one day about a basketball team we knew nothing about"
1,My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot One word can describe this place GROSS The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment The salsa was lame the chips stale There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice Other than that dont waste your money GO TO ABUELOSit may be on the west side but it never disappoints
5,"We stopped here on a Thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating  this place is fantastic
We are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it but as vegetarians we found Sekong by Night so accommodating They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative and it was delicious The spring rolls are really big and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu  veggie broth just like the Vietnamese pho and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef  AMAZING 
Service was top notch and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get
Looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes"
5,Cmon Fresh sandwich lunch for 3 The place makes it to order incredible variety of baguette style sandwiches Cash only but the have an ATM in the lobby with a low fee Or is it no fee Anyway great coffee and drinks and teas Line moves super fast Number pickup system is funky My family packs these things to take home on the plane
5,"Im fairly new to the whole Costco experience Now that weve bought a house its time to buckle down and buy in bulk As as new user Id thought it would be helpful to post the following neat services Costco has to offer

1 Great deals on contact lenses Before I would buy my contacts from justlensescom but through Costco I bought 8 boxes a years supply and received 50 off 25 off via instant rebate at the cashier and another 25 off via mailin rebate which came in less than a month after the order

2 PIZZA AND HOT DOGS The take out pizza is huge and only 999 and the hot dog and coke pair is only 150 These make for a delicious and quick lunch They also have smoothies and salads if youre looking for something on the lighter side

3 Food expos come and go often Recently I got a deal on a 10 pack of pita bread a huge container of hummus and pita chips for 12 bucks The company was from California and let customers try as many samples as they pleased  It was well worth the money and super fresh

4 And heres where I feel Costco has really benefited me My fiance and I booked our honeymoon to Tahiti through Costo Travel Im big on comparing prices before making a big purchase and Costco was hands down the best price It included seven nights hotel and roundtrip airfare all for one great deal The customer service agent I spoke with was friendly and more than willing to answer my 500 questions about travel I would recommend Costco Travel to anybody looking for reliable customer service and excellent travelairfare packages"
5,PHENOMENAL place for Chinese cuisine The portions are HUGE My fiance and I always only order one thing and share it and still always have leftovers The menu prices are very reasonable Including tip we usually dont spend more than 15 for the both of us for dinner They are very personable and attentive to your needs I love that it is a very dainty and has a very laid back atmosphere The lemon chicken is our favorite  They are also very kid friendly We have an 18 month old son who always leaves a nice pile of rice on the floor every time we leave lol but they love him Highly recommend
5,"girlfriend and i always stop here on our treks to lee lee market  If you havent tried pho pronounced fuh  this is a great spot  Basically its a beef soup thats a thousand times tastier than campbells  its served with a plate of crisp and fresh veggies like bean sprouts jalapenos basil etc  that you can throw in the soup   i recommend using the spicy sauce that has roasted garlic in it instead of sriacha   we also had the lemongrass beef salad which was equally good  Everything is fresh and tasty with great service  

make sure you take dobson for the easiest entrance as pho ao sen is facing west"
1,"Nice facilities nice AC but two FATAL flaws

1 Children running around yelling and screaming at all times  This is a failure of the parents and more importantly of the staff who apparently REFUSE to enforce any kind of policies against noise whatsover

To parents and staff THIS IS A LIBRARY NOT A DAYCARE


2  The collection here is 90 DVDs and Dummies books with trashy novels thrown in for good measure"
5,"I was hoping to be the first to review Grayhawk Family Chiropractic but Im glad to see Heather feels the same way I do about them

Dr Frank Sorrentino is a true professional Ive suffered from low back issues for years and Dr Frank always knows how to treat the problem Between regular visits and the website they set you up with to demonstrate stretches tailored to your condition Im glad to report Ive been in good shape for a while

Whether you have an ongoing issue or have just injured yourself Grayhawk Family Chiropractic is the place to go"
5,"This cafe provided me with my first Ethiopian cuisine experience It was delicious and I am eager to go back The most impressive thing to me was their selection of vegetarian dishes They had as many options as those with meat which I really appreciate doesnt happen very often The service was great You can tell this is a family run restaurant that cares about their patrons The food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes 

We started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup This was probably my favorite part of the meal it was absolutely delicioussatisfying and hearty We also had the vegetable combination which had 5 different dishes served on the injera a crepelike bread you eat the main dishes with

This is a fun way to eat with your hands and opened up a new world of foods for us Cant wait to go back and devour a bowl of shorba"
5,"This is hands down the best place for bagels
but more importantly after all my travels it has the BEST Bialy ever
I just wish they would open on in Greenville
Oh it is soooo good a poppy seed bialy toasted with cream cheese
I guess I can only hope they are always open when I visit Scottsdale
n"
1,"The wash aint badbut the process to get it done is pathetic  The ticket writers at the entrance move in slow motion They try to upsell at every opportunity  Four cars backed up waiting to order their serviceand the crew is standing around with no cars going thru
Id rather drive my car dirty then endure the agony of incompetent management"
5,I am very happy to say that Angelas truffles are taking off here in Cottonwood I hope I am allowed to say I am a proud purveyor When they arrived I was impressed by their design and further blown away by the flavor Tears in my eyes My darling have no fear there are people up here who understand flavor quality and most importantly Great Chocolate My beautiful patrons have latched onto these delectable wonders and I am happy to say The Cocoa Palette will always have a place in Northern AZ Wine Country with Bonne Lait Bravo mon ami
1,I guess this is an east coastmidwest thing because I really dont get it Im not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money but I could not finish my plate I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried Seriously when I put my fork through it a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye My husband was also not impressed with his food If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompies
5,I had a manipedi and they did a wonderful job every time I visit The place is clean and the specialists are very nice
1,Shocked this place has 4 stars First off you can always tell if a Mexican food place is good based on the beans and the salsa Well guess what both suck Eat at el molinos and you will never come here again
5,"Well its fresh and its easy  Perfect words to describe this cute clean little store  This was my fave FE in Phoenix because it was a mere block and a half from my place  I STILL miss it and I moved away from Phx over a year ago  I popped in here several times a week to pick up staples it was always an adventure to see which prices had been marked down they even have a section in cold foods where they mark older stuff way down  I appreciated their little bundles of veggies which were sold in justright amounts as in not so much that some of it will end up going bad This market was also great for soups their brand was my pick although they have a selection of major brands as well it was also my goto place for prepared healthful lunches perfect for work like the FE premade burritos and pasta dishes  

Check out frozen foods too there are reasonably priced items like tempura and special organic seafood dishes I never found anywhere else  

I also liked the casual setup of the checkout area with the option for a cashier or selfserve  

Andwait for it I just found out they are opening at least two FEs in Sacramento  okay that wont likely cause much of a stir with the Phoenix crowd but I am so excited theyll be open in my area"
1,sslowest drive through ever
5,"The food really is exceptional Its like the chefs create these perfect little bites and they literally are bites of food that are so interesting to taste

Id recommend the sampler dinner I want to say it runs about 40 50 but its worth it as long as you like whats included

IT IS EXPENIVE BUT the BF and I have been dying to try out this restaurant due to all the rave reviews it has been receiving on Yelp LUCKILY a Groupon appeared for NOCA and we jumped on the opportunity Turned out the fab deal was only marginally helpful Even with the Groupon it was still a 150 dinner plus the cost of the groupon  Granted we did get a bottle wine but the cheapest we could find espresso and a french press cafe Its like you analyze how much everything costs as youre ordering and are still shocked when the bill comes I hate that

Our reservation wasnt until 830pm at night no big deal The restaurant was still PACKED AND people kept coming through the door

It is not a large venue And the tables are CRAMMED uber close together I know that the foursome sitting next to us are going to Isreal next month right after their family vacation to Minnesota"
5,This is my favorite public pool in the entire valley  Its super cheap  225 for adults 100 for kids  You can bring in drinks and snacks as long as they are not in a cooler weird  They have a snack bar Its very clean  Oh and the most important part they have a lazy river two big water slides a whirlpool toddler play area with more slides basketball lap pool diving boards I think thats it  Its quite a drive but its worth it
5,Just came from there as part of my trip down the Apache Trail My 9year old daughter loved it so much she insisted on stopping in again on the way back The town is really cute with tons of photo ops We picked up a few fun souveniers and some prickly pear fudge We did this in 100 degree temps and still enjoyed it For those curmudgeons moaning about this being a tourist trap RELAXthe kids love it This 40 something mom loved it Its free to just walk around  But definitely do the Mystery Shack Weird and fun I actually got dizzy in it
5,This place confirms why hole in the wall places are the best places to get food Its virtually impossible to find the place but once you smell the aroma of homecooked Mexican food you know that youre there Usually there is a long line however their service is quick With the combination of their swift service and decadently savory food Ritos is a staple Mexican food stand that everyone has to visit when in Phoenix I always have a green chilli burrito and havent quite ventured out to other things on their menu but I have never heard anything less than positive about what they have to offer
1,"I am furious

In the last 12 months I have had at least scheduling issues from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning my 1 day off to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday when I went in only to be told someone had messed up and actually booked me for the NEXT week and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am they couldnt get me in until maybe that evening and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissuemedical massage I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that theyd give me my next week appointment free of charge and that shed personally be certain there were no more issues  As I literally couldnt turn my head to the left due to pain I took her up on that BIG MISTAKE

Yesterday the Friday before my correctly scheduled massage I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment to try and avoid last weeks debacle According to the woman who answered the phone it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off but she went to talk with her manager and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok and that shed call with any issues Then yesterday evening I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy confirming and reminding me of my 1130am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist GIven that Ive had 3 migraines this week versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior I really absolutely needed to get in so I felt more confident

Well I was just woken up at 8amagain On my day offagain To explain to me that big shock they messed up my scheduling again and that apparently my therapist was off today Despite Ashleys promise of it not happening again Despite me being proactive and calling to confirm I am sitting here in pain so furious at this repeated treatment that I cant even go back to bedand the best part They dont even have a manager on duty I can complain to

My treatment at the hands of the bookingfront desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing I continue to walk out of there frustrated angry and occasionally in tears I know they say Fool Me Once Shame On You Fool Me Twice Shame On Me but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt Im pretty screwed for today and the next week but luckily an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area At this point it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists getting a massage should feel good and not like youre just a number to them not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment"
5,I was very excited to find this place as you will be when you walk inside and find nice clothes and accessories for even nicer prices  There are several locations throughout the east valley  Treat yourself  You will be happy you did
1,"Decided to give Tempe Marketplace another try after reading recent reviews hoping that they had improved I had to ask myself if we were visiting the same place The traffic and parking situation are still horrible and the loudspeakers in the parking lot are unacceptable The JC Pennys and Targets are crippled versions of their regular stores at other malls The stores here all open too late 11am REALLY to be useful in our uber hot summers except for a Targets that opens at 8am 
Even though I am a Tempe resident I will continue to choose the Riverview shopping area on Dobson over this mishmashed monstrosity"
5,"This location opened up just 3 weeks ago and offers high quality natural products for mainly cats and dogs although there is a very basic small animal section  The emphasis is on foods that are more nutritious healthier and that dont have corn or soy in them There is a large freezer section in the back with a good selection of raw food meals  Also there is a plethora of treats and toys for your furry friend as well  The small animal foods section has a few small bags of hay some treats pellets and toys  I wasnt too impressed with their rabbit selection and they did not offer high quality brands such as Oxbow which is a bit surprising since they have so many high quality dog and cat products

Jill the manager was very enthusiastic and is very passionate about providing the best products for pets  She showed me various treats foods and toys and provided a lot of educational material on dog nutrition and health  She provided a free sample of some nice grainfree dry dog kibble which is highly recommended on dogfoodadvisorcom which I appreciated a lot since my dog is a bit picky with the food he eats  This is definitely a place to go to spoil and pamper your dog or cat"
5,This is the best ice cream Ive ever had bar none  I had the salted caramel and it was wonderful  I felt like I was 7 years old and enjoying my first ever ice cream cone  I also love the decor of the shop the braille on the back wall is so cool although I do wonder exactly what it says  I also bought a pint of their ice cream at Whole Foods I love Sweet Republic and everything it stands for  Totally recommended
5,"This 5 star rating is mostly for their boba They are cool about how many flavors I put into my boba usually about 4 unlike other boba shops that only allow like 2

Their ramen is pretty good and decently priced However I dont like coming to this place much ONLY because I dont like coming out smelling like an Asian restaurant"
5,I really love this place Im not sure why there are so many mixed reviews maybe what they ordered I always get the regular size custom burger blue cheese mayo lettuce tomato and sometimes bacon Simple and delicious The rosemary fries with Smash sauce are also amazing The only thing I didnt care for were the fried pickles a bit too salty
5,"My husband and I LOVE El Metate we joke about putting a line item in our budget for this place we eat there so much Their food is delicious they are family owned and operated  always friendly 
Their hot sauce is to die for both green and red Its possible I like El Metate better than Amados"
1,"One hour That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasnt here A crushing impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service

We arrived found we had free valet parking With a teensy parking lot this works thank you A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating Also a plus Setting expectations andor taking care of waiting customers FAIL

On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here tho we entered Rockerij We asked to be reseated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud conversation intruding music We were reseated by the fireplace and a waiter came over shortly to take our order Bam So far so goodor so we thought 30 Mins after placing our order I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered exactlyso we think it is being taken care of 40 MINS after placing our order I have still only had my coffee refilled onceand had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous driveby waiter never returned A few mins beyond that this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of 

I dont know why its taking so long
and
I put the ticket in right after I took your order

Soas a waitermaybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say15mins after bringing it by the kitchen Perchance What do you think

FIFTEEN 15  few minutes later we still had no food and Id had quite enough Out the door we went

On a comical note As we were outside another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if wed like to come back inside

Oh R E A L L Y The ClueDelivery Train will be visiting you shortly Facial cues you may want to look for in the future are
1 the furrowed eyebrows
2 fuckyou facial expression
and
3 curling fists

It seems that we are not alone in this Courtney Ws review 101412 is representative of what we experienced

I am dumbfounded how they have any good reviews There must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town because this crap would never fly where I live I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN

PS They own 3 restaurants apparently Richardsons Rokerij and Dicks Hideawayall right in the same area Rokerij and Richardsons being attached 

PPS They all serve the same menu It is NOT amazing I have previously been to Dicks Yes it is good No my socks did not come flying off

PPPS ProTip Drive down to Central Phoenix and go to Durants Portlands Switch or Fez All of these places have exemplary service and food to match"
5,"Love the shows the promoters bring in Cozy spot where Ive seen Owl City A Fine Frenzy Landon Pigg and more Plus they are generous with the Malibu Rum  You will need to visit the bar to get your own as Ive never really seen cocktail servers Oh well 

Atmosphere is laid back chill A large patio And yes the Shaker Room The hot shake your stripper ass place to be"
5,I really love the chicken and how it already comes with pickles o The sandwich  Fave I also love the buffalo sauce very addicting
5,This place is great
5,"We traveled from Anthem to find this little Turkish heaven  The drive was worth it 
Loved everything about this place from the service to the food Definitely be back"
5,This place is great I really appreciate the extreme friendliness and kindness of the employees Best customer service Also the variety of favors is fantastic
5,Wow these cupcakes were amazing The frosting was pictureperfect I tried Vanilla Salted Caramel and Pumpkin and both were so good The cake on both were super dense and moist Vanilla Salted Caramel definitely was the best of the two
5,"I am 50 so I require a lot of alterations and it is essential that I have a good alteration service  I will never go anywhere other than Elegant Reflections for my tailoring services  I have had innumerable pairs of pants hemmed here and have been completely satisfied  They have nice private dressing rooms with real doors I refuse to undress behind nothing more than a curtain everyone on staff is competent and very friendly the prices are reasonable and they are almost always able to complete your alterations in less than a week

I have only ever encountered one issuewhen I had two pair of very thick trousers hemmed with a cuff at the bottom the cuff seemed loose  Since I didnt want it to get caught on something and come apart I took them back to be adjusted  The second alteration was done in just a couple days in winter which tends to be a busy busy time for them and the new stitching was nearly indestructible

The staff here also seems to have an exceptional memory because even after a year hiatus they greeted me by name"
5,"Im going to be an uptight stickler here and only review the pizzeria portion of LGO since the grocery part can be done under as a separate business I hope others follow suit Sorry Im super nerdy about this stuff

Anyways the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land I love the flavor and how its always glistening with oil when it comes to the table The toppings are really special here If you even remotely like avocado get their avocado pizza The lemon zest puts it over the top The corn with goat cheese is my next favorite The only one that I havent liked is the the rocket man It tasted fine but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust

We also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening I couldnt get enough of it Its not on the menu seasonal item Im sure but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by

Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines Any time I can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under 20 Im a happy camper"
5,"Cartel is my go to coffee place  If I could drink here everyday I would  The barista who seems to always be working sunday mornings makes the best lattes that Ive ever had ever  Each one always has a cute little heart or leaf shaped on the top which obviously is their secret as to why theyre so delicious  Ive never gotten anything else because Ive already discovered the best  If youre cool you probably like to hang out here on the reg    
I definitely recommend best coffee in Tempe by far 
Its a little hard to find if youve never been before right off university on ash across from the circle k"
1,"As I promised myself Id go back again to try it again Yyyeeaahhhhsooooothe food is still not good I got the mongolian beef and its like wha really is this IRL 

Im a chinese food kind of a fan this restaurant Im not a fan of"
5,If you are staying in Phoenix for any length of time this is a must stop for at least a cocktail  From walking through the kitchen to being seated promptly in a booth this is quintessential gastronomic delight  Durants is an icon and legend Period  Wine list is great have a wellversed sommelier also  I never order Filet but when in Rome
5,"Yeah yeah I know there are already like fiftysomething reviews for this place most of them four or five stars I dont care Heres one more another twig on the bonfire celebrating Richardsons awesomeness

The foods the same awesome New Mexican cuisine as Dicks Hideway around the corner but eating here is a totally different experience The dark pueblo interior with Native American rugs surrounding the highbacked booths provides a great deal of privacy for you and your party I recommend any and all of the seafood dishes  my favorites include the shrimp quesadilla and the scallops OMG the scallops so good when I think about em they make me lose control and type text message shorthand like OMG Of course my friends constantly remind me that as much as I love the food here I cant truly appreciate it because I dont eat the meat dishes which according to them are even better And theyre probably right They usually are

Went with a group of 6 last week which seems to be about as large as the booths at Richardsons can handle for much larger groups theres a private room available at Dicks Service was super friendly and extremely efficient Yeah it can be a little pricy depending on what you order but in my opinion totally worth it Sometimes you gotta splurge"
5,"I LOVE White Lion Tea The company uses great quality of everything
My favorites are Tuscany Ginger Peach Green Passion Tea White Ambrosia Tea as far as I have tried  
Everytime I opened a tea bag I have to take a good deep inhale from a tea bag Its smell soooo great as the tea taste
Thank you White Lion for having such awesome products "
5,"The new Kale salad is to die for 
I love this place Every time we have lunch here it is busy but somehow the staff always finds us a seat The food is always really good and the speed in which you get it is amazing This is the best lunch place in the valley"
5,The slices of pizza are cheap huge and very very good  I really dont have to say anymore
1,Nice looking place with average food and horrible service  Everything took forever and no one came by to see how we were doing  We literally watched our server going around setting tables and taking napkins off of empty tables rather than making himself available to us  He wandered around from table to table in a completely unoccupied area of the restaurant the majority of the time we were there  The food was lukewarm and nothing special  I was only here once so I hate to be so down on the place but based on the other reviews my experience sounds pretty typical  Dont waste your money
5,"Id love to give this place MORE than 5 stars

In Phoenix a few weeks ago I needed to planb a nice dinner for a group of 10  I thought about a few places and wanted to come here because of the view  Get it Different Point of View Anyway while I did initially pick DPOV because of the view I fell in love with the perfect service AND the perfect menu

There were great options for my picky group and not one person left unhappy or hungry  In addition they seem to have a prefix menu with a nice price tag if youre ballin on a budget  

Everything was AMAZING and its definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC"
5,Great multigrain sandwiches Nice patio too
5,"Where to start

The owners are very kind say hi to Benny in the kitchen

My wife and I found this place while living in the culinaryvoid NW Valley of Phoenix and we have eaten here probably 50 times over a 3year period  Everything is good

Gryos
Chicken Pita
Souvlaki
Greek Salads are probably one of the best salads that we have ever eaten
Fries are always fresh
Zatsiki sauce is stellar

The atmosphere is a bit void but people dont come to 35th and Thunderbird for the atmosphere  they come for great food at a great price"
5,"This is a cool dive away from all the Old Town BS The jukebox is one of the best I have heard in some time They were playing songs I never heard of so I know Im going to be in trouble in the future by using Shazam to identify songs and then buying them from my phone
Anyway just be sure you eat before you get there as this is all about hanging in a dive and having drinks They have lots of beer and the bartenders are cool If I lived closer I would hang out here much more"
5,little known secret the golf course bar  amazing margaritas and a supercheap happy hour  didnt mind watching the cute guys checking in after a long day of golfing either  my bff and i were so happy to have stopped here after our day at the spa
5,We recently took a weekend getaway to Phoenix and stayed here The Hotel is beautiful and our rooms were spacious and very comfortable The staff here are topnotch I love the lobby wine  hot apple cider hour in the afternoons and the lobby coffee  hot chocolate bars in the mornings We had access to the Golds Gym across from the hotel and were able to get a good workout in their cardio theatre There is an outdoor skating rink right outside and a small shoppingdining area It is located right across from the stadium and could walk to our event I would definitely recommend staying here especially if you are attending an event at the arena
5,"I can only add my gushing praise to the other reviews  Not only is the food outstanding pork osso bucco green chile stew and pecanfig pie but the ambiance and service really help make this place a standout  So many places have arrogant stuffy service so Scottsdale  Not so here  Also the waitstaff had opinions about the food  which dishes are his favorite and why  Elegant but comfortable atmosphere reasonable prices and a real enthusiasm from the staff and a chef who came to visit with folks that he knew who were sitting near us  The food is rich but did not seem unhealthily so  not bathed in salt and heavy cream sauce  Perfect portion size with a balance  meat grains and veggies  So happy that Becketts is in the neighborhood
Oh  and no valet  I  hate valet parking when there is an ample adjacent parking lot and spots are only limited because the valets put their cones in the available spots"
5,I had lunch there recently and was very impressed with the food  friendly service and excellent value  I had a lunch special  two cheeseburger sliders with sweet potato fries  They serve the burgers with several pieces of fresh crisp lettuce tomato and onion  We will definitely go there again
5,One of my fav sushi places in the Valley  Great place to take someone who has never tried sushi or still is unsure of what they like  Great place to take someone who loves sushi but is indecisive  Some of my favorites include the spicy shrimpcrab roll Phoenix roll and their squid salad  Plus  you cant beat the Vegas roll  150 for 3 pieces Its a steal  Definitely one of the more fun sushi places in the Valley
5,"Im pretty sure that Palees Crown is the best Thai place I have ever been to The service is always great and the Owner comes out to talk to us whenever we are there
The food is so amazing I have never tried something that I disliked at all I especially love the Pad Thai and the Currys I am always full and completely satisfied by the time I leave I also recommend trying the Thai Iced Tea to drink if you are like me and enjoy weird authentic drinks and for dessert be sure to get the coconut ice cream Dont make excuses about trying to spend less money or that you are being careful about what youre eating just try it
The prices are good and if youre not sure what to try stick with a curry but remember that Asian spices are very distinct and very spicy"
5,"We found Ippei happhazardly through United Airlines dining points program and were instantly hooked  We now frequent the place at least once or twice a week

A great atmosphere with a very warm and welcoming host Michael  It has all of the ambiance of a very chic place without the attitude and pompous feel  The wait staff are all very attentive and pleasant  The drinks are creative  And if youre lucky the owner may join you in a sake bomb though he insists this is not authentic Japanese tradition

Im not a huge sushi person and was mainly brought along by my friends so I cant comment on all the finer touches on the sushi and whatnot  I can say however that if you ask really nicely you may be able to try a roll that the chefs are working on that is not yet on the menu including a ribeye roll that is absolutely delicious and friendly to those of us that shy away from sushi because of the whole raw fish deal

Prices are very reasonable  This is an upandcoming spot that is still fairly quiet but not for long  Come now before you have to worry about getting a reservation a week ahead of time  As it is now you can just walk in

Great place to bring a date  low lighting great service great food lots of fun"
5,"Very clean with and old fashion cinema atmosphere Snacks are very expensive so if popcorn and soda are a must for you expect to spend alot of money The amazing reclining seats are worth it though I definitly recomend Cinemark 16 as the place to go to watch movies 
   Also there are alot of great eating places next to it or within walking distance to do the dinner  and movie date night"
5,"This is one of our favorite pizza places  for the food value drinks and great atmosphere I originally discovered them at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival and am so happy I did

It is in a great location walking distance to a bunch of fun bars so its a great place to start the night in Old Town My husband and Is favorite thing on the menu is the margarita pizza The crust is so crisp and perfect As for drinks Jacs has a really fun cocktail menu and also a good wine selection Our favorite the ONEHOPE Cabernet Sauvignon Affordable smooth and pretty cool that half of the profits are donated to charity

Definitely check this place out youll love it"
5,"I saw the review below and just thought it was ridiculous RIDICULOUS 

Elderly people work here or volunteer You expect customer service that youd receive at a highend store No People die and their things that are usually in good condition are donated and are resold at really cheap prices No the people there will not be making sure youre finding everything okay youre on your own and thats how it should be when youre thrifting

I usually find great things Glasswares books shoes purses They have amazing furniture that is so cheap They have many half off days and various sales throughout the week

Just make sure you go on a weekday or Saturday and before 2pm all the stores in this plaza close at 4 and are closed Sundays"
5,"Move over Maizies youve been replacedfor brunch that is I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizies for their brunch and getting smashed Oh and we eat a little too

Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut The food was so ridiculous good that we actually forgot to drink Did you hear me FORGOT TO DRINK

Since it was our first time there we ordered a variety of options I had the Country Toast which was toasted MJ Bread topped with Italian Ham Gruyere Cheese and a sunnyside up egg Holy shit Each bite became increasingly better than the last It was the perfect bite over and over and over again The ham had a nice little spice to it the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it the egg was well an egg and the toast really brought it all together incredibly And it was huge I barely got through half if it before I had to give up

My brunch date got Postinos take on French Toast To be honest I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning however I would have bathed in this french toast It was creamy not overly sweet and literally melted in my mouth

I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal Me Ignoring anything in a champagne flute I know

I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy but Im sorry Maizies consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out"
5,This place is home
5,These guys are greatI  Even though they specialize in Mercedes they never have a problem with my BMW X5 The owner Charles knows what he is doing and never tries to upsell you on unnecessary work  Mary Charles wife is a really sweet lady who always gives me a ride home and picks me up when the car is ready  While Aurohaus doesnt have loaner cars like the dealership they are extremely competent trustworthy and charge reasonable prices for their services
1,"HORRIBLE service  did nothing to correct our experience

On July 7 2011 my date  and I arrived around 630 pm well dressed and ready to enjoy a celebratory dinner without any financial limitations We would have easily spent 250

Instead after an hour of being seated  to review our menus we were never offered more than a cocktail

Tables around us were receiving quality attention by other serverscomplete with the run down of the specials house favorites answering questions etc We on the other hand were lucky to have our make server look at us much less take us to the next step our level in our dining experience

When the table behind us seated a good 15 mins after us received bread before we were my date and I decided that was our tipping point and would not stay any longer

When our server came to ask if we were ready to order we informed him  we would not be staying for dinner  and would like the bill for the cocktail

Never once did the server apologize offer what he could do to make things right etc 

Needless to say we were stunned The hostess thanked us for dining on our way outagain we both gritted our teeth with frustration However later we discovered that after an hour of sitting in the dining room we were there long enough to enjoy a meal Its unfortunate we never got the opportunity to however

What did go right waswe were promptly seated and the cocktail server provided decent service"
5,"wow this place is a gem  highly recommend it if youre looking for a great place to take a date or chill with some friends out in the patio over some wine 

visited friends in the phoenix area over thanksgiving vacation and they took us here on a Saturday night  i dont know much about the chandler area but this place could easily rival any of the popular wine lounges here in san diego  

as for food our group ordered a bunch of the bruschettas flatbreads and a couple sandwiches to share family style  we all enjoyed all of it i especially recommend the fig chutney that was absolutely amazing  from the sandwiches the shrimp blt definitely stuck out as my favorite  overall everything was very good and the service was great 

as for the wine great selection the staff was very helpful in helping us pick out the perfect bottle based on what we like in fact i think i found my new favorite wine thanks to them  if youre a wino like me youll love this place  

as for the ambiance they nailed it  awesome patio and great decor  the attention to detail is definitely noticeable very chill spot 

ps check out the door to their wine cellar i want that in my house its gorgeous"
5,Yum Healthy selections and delicious flavors
5,"If I could only eat at one place for the rest of my life it would have to be at FnB This is ultimate comfort food for me  with the bulk of the menu highlighting local inseason organic vegetables from McClendon and other local farms Charleen prepares dishes that pay the ultimate homage to the vegetable and the farmer with perfect seasoning contrast balance and temperatures 

Beyond vegetables the housemade burrata was light as a cloud and shrimp grilled to perfection on the mesquite Dishes at FnB are simple but often the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right as there is nothing to hide behind  ingredients have to be fresh and of the highest quality and execution must be perfect Charleen and her crew strike it out of the park almost every time

Service is professional attentive and friendly Pavle and his team make you feel right at home which is the other reason why I would happily eat here everyday"
1,They served us stale rice  Average main dishes not as flavorful  Not enough meat in the lamb dishes  Overpriced
5,"Two weeks after I dropped off my computer for service with the Geek Squad I got it back with a new screen and hand rest  They said 3 weeks and I got it in two  And the openbox computer I purchased to use while mine was in the shop was returned with no problems 

I was so happy we purchased a new Toshiba DVD player for 40 Who knew that DVD players could be so cheap  Ive been using it all day and it works beatifully"
5,"im not a vegan or a vegetarian i thoroughly enjoy sinking my teeth into a thick juicy piece of mediumrare steak and i love eggs in the morning and chicken tacos at 2am i am also very hesistant to try anything the attempts to substitute for meat because i think its just psychologically strange BUT ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago ive had nearly everything on the menu and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything

my favorites number one absolutely has to be the mexicali burger i could eat these everyday it has the flamebroiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat but dont let it freak you out it also comes with hummus bright orange nacho cheese and chipotle sauce this burger is SPIIICCYYYY so beware their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned also love their soy ice cream treats soynamis my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch their limeade lemonade and teas are always fresh and delicious i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicylovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant yummmm and tomatos 

their pita chips and hummus are to die for theyre crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing

green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head"
5,"Contrary to the reviwers belowI love Matts Yeah the wait is longthe place is smallonce I went in the summer and I was sweating in my coffee

BUT

This is Phoenix people When the breakfast choices are a tasty meal at Circle K heated under heat lamps or Dennys and IHOP you cant beat Matts 

I love breakfast I eat breakfast everywhere I travel on business I have never had a better breakfast than at Matts Fresh ingredients great food excellent bread and jamkick ss hashbrowns

I wish the place was bigger and cooler and the wait not so long But as a special breakfast treatyou cant beat it  Just bring your own fan"
5,For the past ten years ever since FunSports occupied the same unit this place has been the onestop shop for my biking needs  From BMX at age 13 to road cycling in adulthood SMC usually has what Im looking for  The prices dont really compete with larger chains like Performance but they are reasonable and the service more than makes up for the difference  When I was getting into road cycling the guys at the shop were very helpful with selection fit and pricing  A
1,Not lesbiangay friendly at all I should have read the previous review before going
5,"Im almost hesitant to tell you about my favorite sushi place because its already pretty busy  But oh well  I love Sakana  Its a comfortable restaurant I dont feel like I have to get all dressed up to go there  Dont let the fact that its in a strip mall turn you off inside is small but nice  Their sushi chefs are always very professional and keep their bar very clean thats so important when dealing wih sashimi  Weve taken a lot of people to Sakana and it has never disappointed  We have tried almost all their special rolls and love their sashimi too  Their service staff are authentic and sweet   Ive never been disappointed

Nowstay awaycause I dont want to wait for a table"
1,We used to go to this UPS store quite frequently and had been satisfied with their service but it has been at least a year since we regularly patronized the place  However we had a really unprofessional experience here recently  We went there for rotary services for purchase of home which one employee refused to do and handed off to another employee because as she under her breath notary services were a pain  This employee could not help us either as he had never seen anything like it and he didnt know  want to  have anything to do with something that had power of attorney on it  I guess we are one of the first people around here to sell a home While we waited for this man to do something the employee who handed off our paperwork tried and failed to scan a document to email and was quite verbal and sorry hickish about these stupid machines  After looking at all was going on we didnt want anyone here handling our notary services  Eek  felt like we dodged a bullet  Also dont think I will be going there for any other services  I felt like my IQ dropped 20 points when I went in there
5,"Another place that is really serene and makes you forget you are in a large city I really liked the Desert Botanical Gardens and I am totally not into flowers or botany  We had been to DBG once before for Luminarias but it was so dark that we couldnt see much Im glad we returned in the daylight

We took my inlaws yesterday after brunch and they absolutely loved DBG My fatherinlaw is totally into photography so DBG was awesome for him We saw tons of people with cameras so it is a photographers haven  I really had no clue there were so many types of cactus There are hands on activities scattered throughout probably for kids on field trips and boards with information which comes in handy on the Sonoran Desert Trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is Camelback Piestewa Four Peaks etc  We saw little lizards hummingbirds quail and ground squirrels while wondering around as well

There is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like We spent about two and a half hours there which I think is a perfect amount of time You see everything and are ready to leave by the end  A very nice place to take visitors on a nice day"
5,I indulged big time at Indulge Burgers  More during Fat Tuesday yesterday  There are a tremendous variety including many healthy options such as a turkey or veggie burger  The best part I like is that you can build your own burger with all sorts of yummy toppings  I had the turkey burger and the turkey was one of the best I have ever tasted  Sometimes you can taste like of the darker meats and fatty parts but I felt like this burger was very clean and lean  I would highly recommend the sweet potatoe fries that you can order  You can deep those fries in what tastes like a warm marshamallow dip   The price is not too bad either for what I call a luxury burger
5,"Bosa Donuts at Southern and Mcklintock in Tempe is part of a strip mall that I have been visiting since I was just a kid Except back then Bosa Donuts was a Taco Bell A few years back Taco Bell moved a half mile down the road into a new building and Bosa Donuts set up shop About a year ago I discovered another new store in this strip mall which is Fallout Games an awesome video game store For this entire last year Ive been driving past Bosa on my way out of the complex after visiting Fallout Games and taking a curious look as I drive by but until this week I had never tried it After reading all the positive Yelp reviews I had to give it a go

Well first off Its 24 hours which is huge in my book since Im almost always up until four or five in the morning The drive through display is lighted and shows their menu but you have to actually order by pulling up to the window Since I was there at 3am I asked what was fresh at the moment and the guy was very patient and helpful with listing off what he had available I just got a few frosted donuts or raised as they call them and was on my way Right off the bat I noticed the box was pretty heavy I only ordered a half dozen but it felt at least as heavy as it does when I get a dozen at Dunkin Donuts When I got home I opened the box and realized their donuts are at least thirty percent bigger than Dunkin Donuts of Krispy Kreme

Anyway the donuts are awesome Best tasting donuts Ive ever had I probably shouldnt make it a habit to come here twice a week if I want to live past forty but Ill definitely be stopping by once or twice a month from now on Hope this place sticks around"
5,We went there right before my Grandmas 100th birthday  There were about 20 of us  The place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still didnt have a final count of people  The place was busy but I know why  EVERYONE had a different dish and we all loved it  Everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much  We all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place  Extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had  The staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat
5,Definitely the best choice of eating chinese food in the city where you have limited good Asian food around The Singapore street noodle curry noodle is always been my favorite and the crab wonton is just a great appetizer to start I also like their orange beef Definitely worth to eat for
5,"You want a piece of me said the gargantuan mango tango eggees cup I said YES I DO and give me a big ol veggie samich and some fries to go with my brain freeze thank you very much

5,"I was also roped in with a flier on my door and ordered this a month or so ago when they had their deal for free cookies salad and drink with a pizza order  Upon delivery I was given another coupon for the same deal and a few weeks later received a handwritten thank you note for ordering with them and a coupon for a free order of cheesy bread no purchase necessary  Needless to say this has become a goto pizza option for me  4 stars for food taste and quality an extra for great service and good deals
Salad is pretty average but good enough for me with a pizza pizza is particularly good cookies are awesome cheesy bread is cheesy enough but not just a pile of melted cheese  Their sauce is really tasty tastes fresh and not too sweet  Delivery is free and on time  The longest time Ive been quoted for a pizza at 700 on a Saturday was 45 minutes and they got there in 23 minutes I wasnt timing them but I did notice how quick they got there  They have a hotnready special thats only a dollar more than Little Sleazers and ten times better  And if you dont think its good you get your money back  So really you should just try it  Okay  Okay"
5,"Delicious yet again Pho garlic green beans papaya saladthey can do no dish wrong The owner Justina is hip cool gorgeous and awesome Its BYOB so bring a nice wine or beerno corking fee so dont forget to tip well

If youre eating and theres a big line of others waiting please do what we do and go across the street to gelato so that other people dont have to wait an hour"
5,"Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation reopened September 10thand are we glad they are back  

We had a fabulous duo appetizer fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet carpaccio with shaved mushroom and black truffle  Delicious  Ive always been a fan of prosciutto and melon but the fresh fig was tremendous

Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread mmmm amazing  I dont think you can get this anywhere fresh even here if you ask for it but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time

Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle  Best hand made pastas anywhere  Perfect

Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetablesand more truffles  So rightso full  Im so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey

We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go  What a perfect Italian dinner paradise

We cant wait to go back for opera nightand of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner  Best in the valley"
5,When I found out that they do banquets here I was quick to make a reservation for a wedding rehearsal dinner  The service was as good as it getsperiod  The food choices my wife and I had to decide on were plentiful and the result was beyond fantastic  From the appetizers to the main courses and finishing with yummy dessertthis place rocks
5,"Fez is RIGHT down the street from where I work hence due to its location  general fabulousness it has become a regular spot for happy hour

Heres What we LOVE about Fez
Sweet Potato Fries sooo goodsprinkled with cinnamon by the way
Kisra and Hummus
The Black Bean Burger the first time I ordered it I asked the server Now is this one of those really bad black bean burgers or does it actually taste good  She said I totally know what you mean no this one is goodand she was right
Margarita Mondays aka 2 for one Margaritascheck out the pomegranate one
The atmosphereblue and green tones while still being warm
The friendly service
The close proximity to light rail

Heres what we dont like as much
The slow service sometimes it gets kind of bad I feel like you have to be an active restaurant goer and hail down your serverotherwise you may never get to order get more wateranother drink or get your check
When happy hour ends I mean who likes that anywhere

Fez makes me very happy to work in downtown Phoenix"
5,i go to debon every 3 weeks for aki the hairdresser  shes very nice and asks you a lot of quesitons to make sure you get what you want  she is reasonably priced
5,This place was great Well as great as a doctors visit can be  They called us my son was the patient  back within 5 minutes and immediately saw a doctor  She was kind and took her time  asked a lot of questions and did not hastily diagnose and fully explained to us what was going on with my sons health
5,This is true personal training at a fraction of the cost Its fast convenient clean  friendly You choose the style of fitness YOU want and your workout program will be designed specifically for YOU And you will see your progress after each session AWESOME I like it so much Im going 6 days a week
5,If you are looking for only raw vegan food this is your place  Nothing is cooked everyhthing is 100 raw  They offer a variety of creative options from appetizers wraps soups pizza and pasta  They have freshly squeezed juices smoothies and a variety of different health shots  The dessert is yummy as well  This is a must try
1,This place is disgusting  The bun was dry and stale  The veggie burger was yucky I dont think I have ever had one I didnt like before  The kids meals are miniscule  The topping bar is so simple and plain  The dips are not very good cheese dip is YUCK  Drink choices stink  Cookies taste raw and boring  Almost forgot to add that the two young kids didnt even care for the french fries because they are seasoned  I thought they were a total waste of calories  I cant believe the prices either so not cheap or even worth what you pay for
5,"Authentic mouth watering food
Got the steak fajitas dinnerextremely satisfied"
5,I love that they are kid friendly and that chef Aaron came by to ask how everything was Delicious food
5,"I cannot believe I am about to say this
AIRPORT FOOD IS GOOD

For any of you who eat in airports on a regular basis youve surely come to accept the fact that airport food just sucks  It doesnt matter how much you spend  the bread is stale or soggy meats are dry and tasteless and forget fresh veggies and fruits of any quality

I was just shocked when I visited the Roadhouse at Sky Harbor recently  I had an hour before my flight so I ordered a Stella Artois and a french dip  I wish Id had a camera to catch my expression when I bit into my sandwich  The bread was soft and warm  The meat was tender and tasty  The cheese was really good no joke this was real cheese  And HOT au jus  

OMFG I almost freaked out it was so good  I couldnt wait to tell my server how pleasantly surprised I was  She kinda laughed at me and said they get compliments on their food all the time  AT AN AIRPORT  Folks this is the best kept secret at Sky Harbor  I will make it a point to go out of my way to eat there in the future even if my gate is in another termial

This place is in the low B gates  try it and you wont regret it"
5,Amazing food and excellent service LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico
5,One of my favorite places to satisfy my sweet tooth  I typically will get sorbet and on this evening I decided to get the Raspberry sorbet  I believe that this Gelato Spot location has the nicest ambiance of all the locations  After getting my sorbet I enjoy sitting out on the patio
5,This was the first place my husband to me out to eat out when we started dating OMG I loved it The staff is always extremely nice prompt at this location we enjoy their food and I epically am in love with the 99 cent margaritas they are the best We always have a wonderful time here new and old memories
5,"I am a transplanted Midwesterner so I love me some breakfast  And by breakfast I mean  Hashbrowns sausage bacon pancakes and biscuits and gravy  

Mike and Rhondas makes a mean breakfast with huge portions  For 7 you can have baconsausageham with hashbrowns 2 eggs and biscuits  gravypancakestoast  Come hungry or share

They also serve classic american lunch fare  burgers chicken strips fries meatloaf etc"
1,"This is one of the franchise store of Ritz Camera in Chandler The stores staffs are nice however their photo lab is miss leading They make the price in very small fonts and hanging on the ceiling 

For the first time user to print photos in the lab I was charged for 45 for just few 4x6 and 8x10 print without signin as member I asked for canceling order prior they print the photos I was told Too late even its still in one of their store pc for ordering prints 

Since they are franchise I should be able to return or exchange the accessories I bought for my Nikon D70S camera in different store I was told No I can only exchange or return to the stores I purchase them 

I will not buy anything from them again"
1,"I wish I could rate this place higher but my blow out is terrible I asked for a blowdry with lots of volume and curl It seemed that the cross between the maitai and cosmo would be perfect My hair is flatter than what I walked in with My hair is curly naturally so has decent volume but for some reason its flat Also the stylist pulled my hair alot while blow dryng and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated but have never experienced with a blowdry before I dont think Ill be coming back sad since I love the concept and the salon is lovely

Update They offered me a make up blow out I decided to try the place out again thinking it was a fluke that my blowdry was so awful Mistake Not only was my second blowdry here mediocre I ended up paying for the service I wrote to their manager who had offered the complimentary blowdry but no response"
1,Well I guess the bar is much lower in Flagstaff as we went to their restaurant in Glendale for breakfast  It was less than mediocre  Starting with the coffee which tasted awfulit was very bitter and watching the waitress pour old decaffinated coffee into a regular coffee pot Unacceptable  I had bacon and eggsfair Asked for the hashbrowns to be well donedidnt make a difference I guess as they came out raw  Also asked that my toast be drycame out saturated with butter  My husband had the chicken fried steak with gravyyou could have plastered a house with the gravy  As you can tell we will not be returning  The reason we went was because of their article in the paper this week  Just shows that you cant believe believe everything you read  My husband jokingly suggested that we cancel the paper
5,"I love love love the Keg  Ive been to this location as well as San Tan Village Tempe Marketplace and Desert Ridge and have had nothing but exceptional food and service I really like the atmosphere it has that dark cozy steakhouse feeling without being too stuffy or pretentious  

We enjoyed an excellent  Halloween dinner here last night which included a Keg sized glass of Fetzer chardonnay a margarita very strong the Keg Classic Dinner ceasar salad 7 oz filet wrapped in bacon mixed vegetables and a loaded baked potato bacon wrapped scallops an appetizer that I ordered for my entree and their fabulous bread with whipped butter YUM  Our server was very outgoing and friendly and offered suggestions as far as the menu  The bill with tax and tip was 68 really an excellent value

 Overall a great meal and dining experience  I will definitely be back and cant wait"
1,I decided to break from routine and get a haircut at a local Great Clips I called ahead and asked if they had an experienced barber that could do a flat top The lady assured me that they did I was Leary to say the least when she sat me in a chair of a 20 something fibbertygibbet dressed like Madonna Half way through this butchering she asked my advice and then the advice of the owner on how to accomplish this haircut Kid you not it was an inch longer at the sides than the center I looked like a cross between the Gunny and flock of seagulls I went home set the clippers on 3 and finished the jobWould not go back here unless I lost a bet
5,"I am OBSESSED with Ra  Thank God that it is a chain restaurant otherwise I dont know how I would get my fix when in different states  I dont care what everyone says about the best sushi blah blah blah  This place is THE best

First of all it has the BEST happy hour  I was introduced to the restaurants best items during happy hour when it was less expensive to be adventurous  My absolute favorites are the Sweet Onion Salmon Salmon Carpaccio and Shishito Peppers  The Sweet Onion Salmons sauce is to die for the Salmon Carpaccio is soft and creamy with a nice kick of wasabi and the Shishito Peppers have the most amazing garlictype sauce  I usually order the peppers with a side of white rice and drizzle the sauce on it for a more filling meal  

Other favorites are the RAckin shrimp Uchi No Salad and Vegas Rollbasically any of the happy hour items are great

Oh and I cant forget about the desserts if you have any room left you have to try the cinnamon tempura ice cream but share it because it is very filling"
5,The best Asaian store around Love the selection Awesome smoked herring for cheap Everything is so much cheaper and better than any other Asian store Ive been
1,"we visited on april 15th and And also Sunday April 22
I have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that I couldnt use my BOGO coupon The first time my mother went to pick up our order she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress The second time we ordered I was told that we had to order off of the DINER SELECT menu I did not have my coupon handy and when I was able to read it it says specifically Offer valid for one complimentary Diner Select with the purchase of another entree Complimentary Diner Select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree Valid entrees include SIGNATURE DISHES BOWLS SALADS DINER SELECTS AND LETTUCE WRAPS So why on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon thus spending a small fortune on food TWICE Your customer service is far from what it used to be and I doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future"
5,What can I write that has not been written about the greatness of InNOut Burger Maybe my love is borne of the separation from it my primary residence in Dallas compels I hope that when it opens in Dallas yes the plans for that are public nothing changes
5,Steak cooked to perfection
1,"The parking is my beef with this place  Why does a customer have to pay 12 for each time we park at the garage  If you move in and out three times thats 36 for parking  Yes my company was paying but this was just outright stupid and I wouldnt make my company pay for this again
Ive been to Phoenix twice since then and Ive avoided this place and stayed at the Marriot  Much better place"
5,So glad to have found great Thai in my neighborhood  We thought when we moved away from Tempe that we had lost our access to great ethnic food  Luckily we found this little gem  Great ambience friendly quick service and fantastic food  We ordered the green curry chicken and the drunken noodles with vegetables  Great sized portions for reasonable price  We got ours on a 3 out of 5 scale of heat and it was perfect for us  I have a feeling well become regulars
5,"As far as indie record stores this is truly as good as it gets in the valley
It is a breath of fresh air because it is a REAL record store and you can sample CDs along the wall to get your music fix
I love how they have a list of recommended new releases I definitely refer to them if my music is getting stale
Recently my husband and I have bought albums from Beirut Andrew Bird and Iron  Wine They have everything your heart desires so go and get you some

OH and I just found out you can buy concert tickets there and they usually give out a free Magnet magazine with each purchase Woohoo"
1,The owner has changed hands  this place isnt what it used to be  If you want up to date paper  quality productgo to Scrap Happy OR Crop Girls
5,"One of the most memorable breweries Ive been to not because of their personal beer choices but because of how they run the place They have over 30 beers on tap from all over the country If thats not cool enough the entire back wall of the place is refrigerated coolers full of bottles and cans of even more craft brews that you can hand pick to drink in houseORbuild your own 6 pack to carry out Brews from all over from Epic to Dogfish to Maui Brewing to Sierra Nevada and the list goes onand onand on It really is a nice concept Ohand their food is great too Mostly your normal bar food but pretty tasty

As for the service I was incredibly impressed at how the girls that were serving us really truly seemed to have some serious beer knowledge They were able to help us pick the right beer for our liking and they were right there when the brews disappeared regardless of the fact the place was packed

Know before you go Dont let the exterior fool you Its a small portion of a strip malllook hard or you may miss it"
5,"Been a patron since this eatery first opened  This is honestly one restaurant that has not been hurt by the economy  The food is that fabulous  My absolute favorite salad is the Turkey Waldorf  My children always get the side Caesar with Potato Cream Cheese Soup  The husband always gets either a Cranberry Scone and Onion Bagel slathered with cream cheese OR a Pretzel and some sort of sandwich  

The only downside to this eatery is their lack of seating space during the lunch rush hour  Get there by 11am if you actually want to sit inside otherwise on a windy and cold winter day you might find yourself outside sitting on the patio as I have done in the past

Even with the lack of seating during rush hour lunchIm giving this place five stars and making sure Im there before the rush hour    Happy Eats"
5,I love this place It is one of my favorite Antique shops in the city There is a wide selection and variety of booths and items There is everything here from match boxes cute purses and hats to retrovintage furniture wacky mannequins old cameras and old toys to reminiscence over And They are decently priced and have a nice helpful staff
5,Jon Tess Charlie Erin Kathleen and whole gang are the best
5,Our waiter was Vincent Very polite helpful accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu and the taste of each item Service was A  The food was fantastic No errors was tasteful unique and fresh I will definitely come here again
5,"Holy WOW Batman

This place is ONEOFAKINDits Awesometown  its YUMMY

Once you step inside youll instantly  get the picture    Its WOW factor is off the meter

Smeeks sells a never ending selection of treats of all kindsits THE PLACE for unique off the wall goofy gifts   AND CANDY 

I give a big round of applause to LOCAL small business owners who stick their necks out in ANY economic climate but in todays woefilled world of running a business they become instant SUPER HEROES

If a picture is worth a thousand words you can take a peek at 25000 more reasons to visit Smeeks here

1,"Wish I could review this place on service but I wasnt able to get one  Walked in at 1 PM on a Sunday afternoon for a mani pedi was told by the front nail tech to have a seat  I get it I walked in on a Sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and I am fine to wait  My wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me  Then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me  You know your salon you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time  I ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away  

The place in general was dirty nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere  I did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy"
1,OH MAHHH GOSH what retards they have working here Came in to pay for my phone bill and literally stood in line for 40 effing minutes They had TWO ppl out on the sales floor that afternoon and the store was freaking packed Really What genius decided to schedule TWO freaking meatheads who knew diddly squat about anything on a busy Saturday afternoon And no I dont care to upgrade my phone I JUST WANT TO PAY FOR MY BILL AND GTFO OF THERE Do you really think that after such poor service I am going to want to up your commission rate by purchasingupgrading my phone with you NO
5,Definitely an awesome buffet  Not your typical buffet stereotype  Love the sushi   Great variety of things to have  If memory serves  it was 1999 when I was there  I think a tad high but someone mentioned 25 bucks so maybe its come down   Sake is priced well and the beers
5,"MMMMM Let me break it down for youwhen you can hear staff in the kitchen saying oh wow that looks amazing as plates are coming up in the window youre in for a treat I mean the fact that they see these dishes time and time again and are still excited by them Then flash forward to the next day and if youre heating up second lunch I like to eat in the office micro and employees comment on the delicious smells yeah youre doing aok I was solo this time because Gabi M was home with baby Mess and I didnt think to call Jarred sorry bud Eating alone certainly wasnt as much fun but it was delicious Eggplant is a must You just HAVE TO get it done In addition I also had a really yummy chicken dish with wide noodles veggies basil and a spicysweet sauce SO tasty The portions are enormous so dont balk at the prices Grab two entrees share with the group take home leftoversthat simple 

Know Before You Go  Im only in Scottsdale one every other month and Tottie still remembers me when I come in and that rocks Big fan"
5,Been a loyal customer since they opened ten years ago  Quality cut and great people These are professional barbers who have been doing this for years  No froo froo  Russian not spoken there
5,"Had lunch here with my wife today Its the second time Ive been and her first After my first visit it rocketed into my top five favourite restaurants of all time They have some top notch food and the best thing is that its such a deliciously welcome change from the bottomfeeders Mexican crap that you see all over Phoenix The menu is varied and I think I eventually will want to try everything Appetizers include fried alligator and frogs legs The main I had today was their Mardi Gras Pasta which is linguini with tomato thinsliced garlic andouille sausage crawfish meat onion and delicious shrimp topped with a really nice creamy sauce Absolutely delicious The wife had mahimahi with an even NICER sauce and dirty rice on the side Although a tiny bit on the pricy side its definitely worth coming back to Large open seating outdoor seating also available dimly lit oldstyle jazz a large fullservice bar and a very quaint outside waiting area with water feature giant fans etc The service was also great and both times Ive been the waiters have been very helpful the first guy told me that if I got the large serving of alligator to try it halfblackened  a great tip which allowed me to taste both styles of the appetizer They also have things Ive not heard of before like etoufee and opelousas If my dad didnt live over seven thousand miles away Id take him here in an instant  hed absolutely love the place You will too

Oh yeah they have creme brulee with fresh fruit and sweet potato pecan pie amongst other things for dessert We had the latter  yum"
5,Owned by a serious James Beard nominee this is high taste funky fun for killer Mexican food  We sat at the bar and joked with the cool bartenders for a while all the time trying a myriad of different tacos  Every single one was great  This is the real deal with a creative edge
1,"I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayos really disappointed me last night When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait However when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me not too long We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began 

Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server yay however she told us she had another tables drink order to get and then she would be back for ours boo So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours 

After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out Seriously 50 minutes thats about how long I planned to spend at Macayos not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out So after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait Apparently she couldnt have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time 

I dont recommend going to Macayos You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road"
1,If I could give zero stars I would Just about the worst experience for my friend and I We came in for a quick and easy dinner  After being ignored at the door way repeatedly we sat ourselves  First we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back Our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving I have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone Theyre lazy slow and completely ruin the entire experience of dining there  The happy hour prices are great but there are other RAs so do yourself a favor and go to a different location
5,"Superb gelato  some of the best Ive ever had The guy behind the counter is the owner and he takes pride in his gelato

They only use real sugar not high fructose corn syrup and nothing contains hydrogenated oil

I tasted a few flavors and settled on the coconut it was sublime 

Definitely some of the best Gelato I have ever had When I need a mid day sugar rush Ill be back"
5,Best steak I have ever eaten is at Ruths Chris steakhouse Comes to your table sizzling hot Sides are sold individually but are pretty good The deserts and appetizers are awesome Being an upscale place be prepared to take a hit in the wallet If you really want to impress a date this would be a good place to do it
5,"The last time I was at The Vig they tricked me You see they have these glass doors that they open up in the back of the restaurant when its nice out and sometimes when you go through those doors from the outside to take a trip to the loo they close them on you so like an asshole you attempt to walk back outside the way you came but instead you bash your head and knees into the glass window in front of 35 people Be mindful of this

But hey at least they had the most amazing wine specials that night and I was saucy enough to laugh it off and take a bow And then I hid in the bocce ball pit for the remainder of the evening where I somehow acquired 200 bruises 

I love the Vig Even when Im embarrassing the shit out of myself"
5,"Im so happy this store is located so close to my house Every time I come to this store I get great service I mainly use this store to get food items for my dog or the grooming salon  where Zombi has never had a bad experience This location also has a Banfield Vet Hospital PetsHotel Doggie Day Camp Training services and at times has adoptions My best friend has used both the PetsHotel and the Doggie Day Camp for her pooch and has never had a bad experience I also used the Banfield Vet to get Zombi uptodate on her Rabies and the Vet was super nice The best part was that I didnt even have an appointment I just walked in and they were able to fit me in after a five minute wait

My only pet peeve pun intended is there is usually only one cashier working and the line can get pretty long However it doesnt take long for another employee to open up another line to speed up the checkout experience AND they usually show up on their own without customers complaining about only having one cashier Bonus"
5,"I visited this place in January while I was in Phoenix and I miss the food My vegan friend suggested this place to me and my other friend we were skeptical that vegan food could taste goodshe proved us wrong

The food here was delicious Id eat here regularly if I lived in Phoenix When we arrived we were worried about the hours since we got there pretty close to closing time but they were cool We shared the samosas and buffalo wings for appetizers I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl with mock chicken and noodles for my entree I felt like everything was flavored well and while I enjoy meat normally this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future I liked the ambiance here great place to grab a bite with friends and chill It was the perfect place to stop by after a busy weekend Ill be back next time Im in the area"
5,"This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix Ive never had better pho than here I usually order the spicy beef sate pho which is miles above the rare beef pho My family and I also order the pork spicy treats which is a rollyourown spring roll Its delicious and fun One order feeds all five of us 

The owner is also extremely nice They also offer discounts to ASU students Have to love that"
1,Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly And i informed the manager of it as well I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep I wouldnt pick this one the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say But the Train noise is just unbearable I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable Stay Elsewhere I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail
1,"I should have taken my own advice and stayed far away from this place Our most recent visit ended hastily when I was served rotten tuna and got barely a sorry from the staff I could smell that the fish had gone horribly horribly off when the ahi tuna salad was put before me by the waiter and Im shocked that the kitchen actually thought theyd get away with sending it out The waiter disappeared so quickly from my table that I had to go hunt him down to point out the bad smell at my table was coming from the food and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say okay we all smelled it and theres definitely something wrong there

Seriously You had to go pass it around to confirm that Im not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell After all this their solution was to comp an appetizer not the salad and eventually gave me a new salad to go which I decided not to eat just to be on the safe side 

Look Im not scared to eat week old leftovers or sushi at a divey joint and I dont really get freaked out by the cleanliness of restaurants but this could have been dangerous  I have absolutely warned off all my coworkers and friends against this place and now Im warning all of Yelp It could have been handled in a way that left me confident that it was just another new restaurant kink but the awful service made it clear thats not the case and I shudder to think of what new low theyll sink to"
5,Love this place  Friendly staff Always a treat to see whats cooking on the weekend I dont mind standing in line to order Great way to meet new friends and talk to old ones Ask Kiersten about the cortadito
5,"Paradise Bakery is one of those places that you can count on for always having something good when your driving around wanting more than a burger and not a sit down meal with a waiter 
I love the Cranberry Turkey sandwich with fresh fruit The nice thing to consider is that you can get a whole or a half on the sandwich of your choice
Once you feel good about the healthy choices youve made you encounter the cookie section at the register All Im going to say is that the chocolate chip is to die for The chocolate chips just melt in your hands Doesnt get any better than that 
Paradise Bakery does also have a great breakfast should you want a nice place to go after a nice hike or just want to treat yourself and a friend to great place to visit 
Put Paradise Bakery on your always good list"
5,"Some of the best Italian food I have ever had This is a favorite for my wife and I Sima and Marcellino are very nice people very inviting The bar is small but fun to hang out at The food is always fresh and delicious

Watch out for Marcellino  he likes to push the truffles"
5,"True Mexican street fare  at first a little intimidating for this Gringa but it was awesome   The owner Dan who happens to be a Culinary Institute trained chef put together a variety pack for us  Everything is small and cheap so you can get a whole bunch of different stuff to try  30 fed 5 people

On the NE corner of 19th Ave  Glendale next to 711  Give em a try  you wont be disappointed"
5,I had lunch at Lons and wow what a great experience  Great food great service and great ambiance outside  I met the Chef at an event and he was less than friendly  Maybe he was having a bad day  His unfriendliness aside this is a must try if you are  in the area
5,I love this place Been to a few different locations and the pizza is always excellent Yesterday my boyfriend stopped by the Camelback and 10th St location and picked up pizzas to take home he called in advance as the pan pizza takes at least 30 min I had a veggie tomato basil garlic and he had a meat combopepp and sausage So delicious The only complaint he had was the parking situation there It is kind of tough but well worth it I absolutely recommend Oreganos
1,I was really disgusted with this place I should have known when we walked in on Saturday at 1230 PM and there was no one not exagerating  there  But we were hungry and hot so we stayed I wanted shrimp tacos but no shrimp at tacos del MARjust frozen fish that you need to order 5 minutes ahead because they need to microwave it   Its breaded and precutcouldnt they at least get the kind that has different shapes and looked like it wasnt completely processed  The kids had bean burritos which they usually love anywhere but didnt like at all My husbands chicken burrito tasted like a school cafeteria  The clincher was that the unsweetened ice tea tasted rancid  I think they let the tea bags go bad or something  Gross and how annoying that they  dont have seafood  Wahoo tacos from La Jolla please come here to AZ
5,"What a restaurant Absolutely loved my experience at Tarbells Ive been hearing rave reviews for quite sometime and decided to try it out recently My party and I sat at the bar which was a great choice because the bar was comfortable rather large and really social and fun The bartender young woman was fabulous inviting and very nice She was very attentive A guest in my party dines at Tarbells often and she had his drink in front of him by the time we walked to the end of the barNow thats some customer service for ya

Food  We started with the Calamari A favorite dish of mine and this one was outstanding Two very different but delicious dipping sauces A roasted red pepper and a pesto mix Not sure which one I liked more  I enjoyed the panseared jumbo sea scallops TO DIE FOR I am a huge scallop fan and these were done just right Caramelized giving them the right amount a sweetand it was served over very yummy risotto Another dish enjoyed by my party was the Fennel Sausage Pasta dish the fennel sausage was AMAZING 

Overall experience was fantastic as soon as I get another opportunity I will be dining here again "
5,"NOTE  I only had takeout and it was brought to me by my boss  She rules
She got me a hummusgrilledmarinated chicken combo  It has 3 different hummuseses HA roasted red pepper jalapeno and plain ole hummus  They are sectioned off in the big plastic container which rules for my OCD as I dont like my food touching  In the center is a PILE a total monton of grilled chicken  Its got some sort or spicy rub on it but not too much kick  It had been marinated too  And tenderI think this is the most tender chicken I have ever had  It made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was
Im not big on pita so instead she got me a side of cukes  
This thing weighs a ton and Ive been eating it for 2 hours  I have made a mess in my Make me Yelp boyshorts"
5,"I live in LA where these shops are on every corner  I can say without a doubt this is the best FroYo Ive had

On top of that the store staff is superfriendly and the place is immaculately clean  They are also serving gelato pastries and fresh coffeeespresso  Check it out"
5,will review after I eat Ok so we ordered a Mongolian beef combo plate sesame chicken YUM and pork fried rice  and sweet and sour pork This was really really  good food Good prices When we are in the area we will definitely go back
5,This is a good store for your beauty needs They are open until 8pm too which is nice
1,"Wow Im not even going to wait until Im done before leaving a review I just placed my order 30 minutes after sitting down

1135  Sit at a table for 8 an order drinks So far so good

1139  Things were going alright when we had a table of 8 but when a few more people showed up to attempt to give Floridinos some money in return for a quick lunch all hell broke loose

1141  There was a room next to us with a bunch of empty tables You cant sit in there We dont have a server in there Screw it we picked up our drinks and moved in If they can serve us at that table they can serve us one table over in this other room

1145  We asked to see the manager

1150  We can get you drinks in here but not food We have to wait for a table to open up out there Then we can serve you

1152  Someone who looks like a manager peeks into the room and leaves We still havent spoken to a manager

1155  We dont want to overwhelm the kitchen Hmm If you didnt want to overwhelm the kitchen maybe you should have taken my order 20 minutes ago

1205  Theyre taking our food orders in the Forbidden Room I guess theyre not as allergic to accepting our money as they led us to believe

1232  Just received my food in the Forbidden Room Pretty much exactly an hour after I got here

You suck Floridinos"
5,"Still my most favorite hot dog ever and I think the magic is in the presentation Theyve got the best hot dog sleeve It perfectly holds the dog lots of chili and its not messy

Another must have is a Cherry Lime Squeeze Sprite Cherry flavor squeezed limes and maraschino cherries"
5,Healing hands  A dedicated professional  therapistintricate bodyworker who listens to your needs to develope an individualized treatment  Focused in addressing  my health concerns and goals  A message like no other that left me  feeling restored with the added bonus of spot on nutritional advise  an overall concern for your good health   To feel renewed  highly recommended
5,I go there often Love the food Love the atmosphere Great beers  usually great service
1,"Went to Sol for restaurant week  Was less than impressed with the bitter salad with MIA avocados the carnitas that were very bland and boring the rice was delicious however the black beans tasted like aspirin dessert was a dulche flan that was hard solid and icky  Service was average took 2 hours to get thru dinner  Best part was the refreshing wine and beer

Cheers to SOL we wont be returning"
5,"Had a wonderful birthday dinner at CIBO last night This was about the 3rd or 4th time visiting this quaint house turned restaurant and now is the time to YELP 
CIBO has wonderful appetizer of antipasti that played with my taste buds Fun to make your own brushettas 
My husband and I shared the Rustica delightful delicious delectable 
And the crepswhat can I sayI didnt need it but I wanted it so I had it so there Fresca creps with fruit vanilla ice cream and fresh whipMmmmfood coma Lovely service and birthday"
5,"I was surprised by the depth and distinctness of the olive oil  I was expecting oiliness with hints of flavor but instead was pleasantly surprised by bold flavors carried on an already flavorful oil  This place far outshines other oil stores which add flavor essence to their oil  They infuse the flavors here making them stronger and more authentic

Overall great oil and balsamic vinegar  Try their food such as the sandwiches  And definitely try as many oil samples as you can  The oil is not too expensive 20 per bottle  Well worth it if you like to use it on bread or to add some great flavor to a salad"
5,"Best cajun food in town not just from a truck  Phoenix doesnt have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so I was amazed at Food Truck Friday to find Jamburrito  They have a pretty stellar selection of meats  meals considering its from a truck

The spices were perfect  just spicy enough to enjoy but nothing thats going to harm  I had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice not in one sitting because the portions are VERY filling"
5,Great service atmosphere and of course great food My wife and I decided on Blue 32 last night for dinner We have been there many times but we felt we needed to share our experience  We enjoyed sitting at the bar having a few drinks and visiting other patrons Around 950 we realized the kitchen would be closing I asked Daniel and Baeley the bartenders what time the kitchen served dinners of course he stated 1000pm OOPS But Daniel said they would prepare what ever we wanted  I asked him to check to see if they have already started to clean up first We do not like to ask the kitchen staff to prepare dinner if they had already began or completed clean up Daniel returned to say that yes they had finished the grill but he again repeated that they would still prepare anything we wanted At that time we declined to have the kitchen staff prepare anything But a moment later Roman the chef came up to us and sincerely stated that he would be more than pleased to prepare whatever we wanted Still we were not wanting to make such a request  that late but with his sincere and friendly personality he still insisted that they were more than willing  So we asked him to pick  and prepare something of his choice which turned out to be the best two burgers that we have enjoyed in a long time a Bacon Cheese Burger and his speciality Texan Jalapeno  Burger both with extra crispy bacon just the way we like it SOOOOOwe would highly recommend Blue 32 and its staff including by name Roman the chef and Daniel and Baeley the bartenders  Every time we have gone to Blue 32 we have had nothing but a great experience this place is a must
1,I would not recommend this place to anyone  I went there looking for a gift  I received no help  The girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players  I guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store Also they did not have a very good selection of items I think I will take my business to other stores who care about their customers
5,I took my computer to RedSeven recently when my friends were calling and telling me I had a nasty virus that was sending out gobs of email every fifteen mins  I had no idea my computer was infected  I was hesitant to do so because I needed my computer to do some work No worries the fellas over at RedSeven hooked me up with a loaner  I was able to get online and get my work done and get my home PC back the next day without missing a beat  I was going to take my computer to one of those BIG BOX store repair places I am so glad I didnt  A friend of mine took their PC there and when it came back all of their family pictures music and email was gone  I will only be using RedSeven in the future and I suggest you do the same
5,"I have to admit I normally dont like Chinese food In fact its just about the only style of food I havent fallen in love with at some point in my life This is a real problem when you live with someone that would die for Chinese food at all hours of the daynight 

I figured out why I never liked Chinese food when I first ate at Asian Cafe Express Its because everything Ive had has been Americanized Chinese Food  It was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when I actually found Chinese food I not only liked I LOVED Having authentic Chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine

I have to agree with the others save yourself the time and skip the first few pages Go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic Hong Kong Style fare Holy mother of god everything Ive tried has been outstanding and each time I leave saying it was the best meal Ive tried thus far 

Everything is extremely cheap and the service is superb The wait staff are always very helpful and knowledgeable about their food Theyll be quick to recommend something if youre having a hard time deciding Just ask"
5,"Like Sex or Tobacco Hells yeah were not looking for vanilla yes here this place pulls out all the stops

If  Ichi Yakaguru the new york club promoter and 9yo Japanese pimp needed anything it could be found here

The best selection of DVDs and printed material i have come by in awhile lots of Toys so much stuff a lot of it is hung above the head so look up

Lingerie Tobacco Human Fire Hydrants Hobos with Soap Sud Beards"
5,Been here twice now and wish I could say more The food is delicious the set up is really relaxing and service is great A great place to take an out of town guest Happy hour menu has these amazing tofu tacos that I highly recommend My boyfriend had the Pork tacos which he said were also delish Definitely check this place out
5,"Mims Burger  Mexican Food was revealed to me by my sister and sometimes when I think about it even when I JUST ate my stomach growls  The restaurant itself just SMELLS GOOD sitting there and waiting for your food to arrive

The strange name would sort of you know ordinarily turn me off from trying the place because I think when restaurants serve this AND this they usually just serve two wildly different forms of food both of which suck  Mims serves legitimately good Mexican food burgers hotdogs and everything else

Even if youre NOT in the area its worth going a bit out of your way for it

Five stars  Places dont get much better"
1,"I was searching for a unique item to give as a Thank You gift and I stopped by Practical Art over the Labor Day weekend after viewing some items on their website  I was extremely under underwhelmed by the service I received and do not plan on returning  

When I arrived the young woman behind the counter was having a personal conversation with an acquaintance  Besides the employee and her conversation buddy the store was empty  I spent about ten minutes looking around and the young woman did not have the common courtesy to acknowledge me with a simple Hello even as I was viewing items directly in front of the counter  When I was leaving the store she did break long enough to say Bye

I believe it is very important to support local business but I will not spend my money here  I did find several items I wanted to buy and made note of the artist I have done the extra leg work to reach out to them to find out how to purchase their items through other channels  I do not feel they should miss a sale due to the sub par customer service at this location"
1,"Went into the location and waited minutes for someone to appear to ask us for our order and even after we said Hello they didnt acknowledge us Had to repeat order several times It was very frustrating how nothing seemed to be in stock no philly cheese steak nor soup was available I heard someone as I was leaving being told some type of bread wasnt available which is actually understandable condiments and bread sometimes run out or need to be retrievedbaked 

Felt like we were being rushed and just didnt feel like a clean place Will not go back"
5,"Dear LoLos why do you have to be so damn good  I really wish that when I had you last weekend you had been dry and tasteless so that I wouldnt have to come back and eat Fried Chicken and Waffles again but now you have made me an addict to your delicious mouthwatering juicy breasts  thighs Woah where is this going LOL Thank goodness you do takeout for now my husband will have to do his husbandly duty and pick me up a piece or two on his way home from work 

Truly wonderful I never had waffles with fried chicken before and Im not sure why I was so surprised at how great this pairing would be but I was Great service everyone was friendly and upbeat and seemed to actually enjoy working there which is definitely a PLUS  I love you Lolos"
5,I have completed this run obviously not the 27th annual edition 5 times now The course is always the same  a bit hillier than other Papgo courses as it takes a right along the sidewalk behind the zoo but the organization is always excellent The tshirt is another good draw to this event  a long sleeve shirt that changes color in the sun There is always food at the end a raffle and a great crowd One of the best events on the racing calendar each year and an excellent way to start the new year off right
5,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Phoenix This is where we go to celebrate and to enjoy a night out with amazing food and great service Noca is an experience I wouldnt recommend trying to quickly hit up a meal here before trying to catch a movie I cant imagine trying to rush the experience

On our most recent visit I immediately ordered my favorite cocktail the Dirty Bird Its so perfectly crafted and smoothplus there are bleu cheese stuffed olives Sold I felt a little bad because my fiance wanted to celebrate our new jobbyjobs with prosecco my bad Lay off me when theres bleu cheese stuffed olives and vodka involved mister

First up was the mixed salad I love how its not overloaded with cheese and candied fruit Its the perfect balance of flavors 

We then had the lobster roll and it was absolutely heavenly I really hated to share that but I needed to save room for the scallops The scallops were so perfectly cooked and the plating was gorgeous The flavors were outstanding absolutely sublime Ryan actually asked me if I remembered his name I just smiled"
5,"I found this place based on Yelp reviews so I feel obligated to add one more 5 star review to the mix I needed to get a chain fixed on my bike and was not looking to spend a ton of money or hours trying to fix it myself So I stopped by and had them take a look at it 

They recommended a full tuneup to keep it in tip top shape and spent the time explaining and demonstrating why it is deserving of spending money beyond the chain repair  I ended up passing but didnt feel like they were trying to take advantage of me Since it was close to closing time I left the bike with them overnight and got a call late in the morning the next day for pickup It has been as good as new ever since 

Having my fair share of riding in the Valley of the Sun Im sure Ill be back soon for some intertubes or a spare part for whatever craigslist bike I happen to be riding around at the time

Protip Check out the unique bike artwork they have around the place Also they have a small BMX  track in their backyard you can ride around and do jumps on anytime"
5,"I had such a great time at this place both times i went  The first visit was a sushi dinner extravaganza with my sister  The place was literally a 10 minute walk from my childhood home where my parents still live which was the first bonus for this place  Once i walked in my excitement grew  The place was small and intimate although a bit on the hot side  Our waitress spoke with a heavy japanese accent and she was very friendly  

We ordered a bunch of rolls they have a fairly small selection of rolls which is fine with me and some nigiri  They even had Uni  i dont know how it is in phoenix but i live in Salt Lake City and Uni is incredibly hard to find there for some unknown reason  Anyways the sushi was well prepared and tasted very fresh  Their yellowfin was just amazing

My next visit was a lunch with my mother a few days later and we ate mostly nonsushi offerings which were also very good  I had yakisoba which was delicious and my mother had the bento box with teriyaki steak which was also fantastic  

This place is a real gem and for me personally the location is perfect"
5,Wedge salad is delish Love the fact that its organic as well as the fact that the pizza dough is glutenfreesure beats having my husband sneeze for an hour after eating regular pizza I will say the pizza is pretty goodand this is coming from a girl from Chicago
5,Parents please let ur children explore on their own  I c parents following their kids around 
5,"Originally came by to get a watering system for our chickens and ended up buying something for every member of our furry family They have everything here for cats dogs small birds rabbits poultry horses and more The customer service was excellent we were even given free samples for our chickens without even asking and were given informational sheets about some awesome products we ended up buying as well Both of the people working were concerned with taking their time to help us not about making a sale and will even special order some products for us if ever needed We dont feed our dogs dry food anymore they now eat raw instead but when we did these are the premiumhealthiest brands we were buying at a much higher cost at other retailers

The prices are low the hours are convenient the customer service was great the products are healthy and the selection was large for how small the shop is what more could you ask for Great first visit and we will definitely be coming back again"
5,Everything I have tried here is awesome You cant go wrong with your choices Service is ok Could be better Not very personable
1,If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars  But Im not  rating it based on the food  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment  Be warned if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go  Ive been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties  So for an over 50000 bill they will take 15 different forms of payment but wont split up the check by individuals or couples  How does this make any sense  To make matters worse they bring out the sushi and I quote family style  Since when did sushi get served family style  Here is the problem  Sushi is expensive not everyone at the table ate it and when served family style someone else may get what you ordered and you wont have a clue it even made it to the table  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill SERIOUSLY  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was this is our company policy we do not split checks for large parties  This is absurd  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill Im pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill  How could you know with that many people ordering  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I dont normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return  If policy is no separate checks at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur  They said someone was told when the reservation was made  The reservation was made for 25 people  It wouldve taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information  Worst experience ever
5,"I went here on a Saturday night and sat outside listening to the band playing in the background  It was part of the Music Under the Stars or whatever it called very cool and fun though  BTW I see a lot of people commenting on how loud it was to all you yelpers take that with a grain of salt its a pizza place near a large family residential area on a weekend what do you expect I guess its an expectation thing  By no means is this going to be a quiet candlelit dinner for two  Its a classy family oriented pizza place 

We ordered the caesar salad and small pepperoni pizza Very well priced and the pizza in my opinion tasted delicious  It seems like everybody has some weird opinion on how good pizza is and I guess I have a weird opinion as well  Here goesthe size of the small is not small it was more like a medium value winningsorry lame Charlie Sheen pop culture reference anyway it had a faint sweet taste on it which i really like the cheese was good not too much sauce and the pepperonis were very flavorful  They were the small kind and they were just great  The Salad was good salad is salad its hard to mess that up  

We were helped by an awesome bartenderserver named Chandler  Cool guy really nice he kept us entertained  

Well be back I want to try some kind of meatlovers next time we go there"
5,"Theres a certain amazingness that comes from fresh made ice cream  Its soft creamy and not filled with high fructose corn syrup and preservatives to keep it together for months in a freezer  Growing up in Arizona we always made homemade ice cream in the summer and if youve never experienced homemade ice cream just go to Churn
I had the banana ice cream with caramel sauce on top  I cant say anything bad about it at all  If someone doesnt like their ice cream its because theyve been subject to all the fakeness added to ice cream in the stores and national ice cream shop chains  
The shop has lots of toys and candy and knickknacks that will give you a sense of nostalgia  Ill tell you what sounds like the best day ever  riding my bike down Central on a beautiful Phoenix day stopping in to Churn for an ice cream break and then popping into one of the restaurants nearby for a cocktail"
5,Top notch He is now my go to barber Charged only 16 for cut and beard trim but I throw him a tip on top of that for an exceptional cut He will ask you questions throughout the cut to make sure you end up with the cut you came for Cant go wrong with this guy And what a cool place
5,"By far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Arizona  The service is always awesome the place is always clean and the environment is always welcoming and friendly  I love hole in the wall familyowned restaurants because at least the ones I have been to there is always a sense of pride in their service and their food  Ive been to this restaurant a few times and have loved everything I have tried  I like being able to taste flavor not seasoning and their Dolmeh appetizer is just that a perfect medley of herbs grape leaves and rice  

I usually order the 6  Beef Kebab but I have tried their 3  Chicken and Gyros and 7  Lamb Kebab  The meat be it beef chicken lamb or gyro is always moist and tender  Like their meat the grilled vegetables have a perfect blend of crispy and lightly seared on the outside but juicy and steamed on the inside  The basmati rice is always thoroughly cooked and flavorful  The same goes for the Homous Baba Ganoosh and Yogurt Cucumber Dip  I highly recommend their house Combination Platter  The pitas are always warm and their homous and ganoosh have the perfect texture  

Try to go around 5p to beat the dinner rush  The place is always packed on Saturday nights so show up a little before regular dinner time if you want to ensure seating for your party"
5,"i just finished licking my fingers clean and almost ate the dressingdrenched paper that held my very first and surely not last lucky boy international burger

crispy bun tons of dressing fresh lettuce tomatoes pickles and onions and a perfectly tender smokey burger thick perfectly salted crunchy on the outside and soft and burning hot on the inside fries thick and deliciously sweet chocolate and peanut butter shake

gone in less than 5 minutes

place closes early so unfortunately there will be no drunk trips through the dangerously narrow drive thru"
5,This is a GREAT place to eat One of my favorite lunch stops as you can see if you follow my facebook photos Lunch With Stew My favorite thing there is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza mmmmm mmm Kevin ODonnell is from the Texas Holdem family of final tables and occasionally will play the tour Super great guy and he also has a super great restaurant and sports bar
5,Amazing sandwhich joint A must go place to eat
5,"5 stars all the way 

Let me begin by saying that Im a big fan of the products The store is done in very warm tones and the drinks are incredibly aromatic and these 2 things combines seem to make all my stress melt away when I step in the door 

Im not a huge coffee fan but I can order some of the coffee drinks here Im completely unable to drink the caramel frappuccino from Starbucks but I cant get enough of the caramel ice blended from Coffee Bean  Tea Leaf

So now that weve established that I love the product we can move on to the real reason this place gets a 5 star reviewthe staff Ive never seen anything like it If you come in 37 times someone will probably know your name and might even know your drink

Leila is the best at this She knows peoples names their drinks and if you come there often enough she even knows which car you drive Shell see a regular customers car pull up and shell have the normal drink ready and waiting for them by the time they walk through the door THAT is the epitome of customer service"
1,"Quick spot for a mallmade mayobased California roll This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong

Youve been hard at work doing swipeandsign Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neimans on a worthless Jhane Barnes sweater and some silklined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whatsleftoflastseasonscollection of Brioni blazer Whatever your fancy youre toting a wrist full of roped glossy shooshingsounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi

Its OK but beware Unagi and other hot items have a beepbeep beepbeep before they get to you California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick  cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise Rice is not right either Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup

If head chef Rick is there think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback then Ichi Ban University off McClintock ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid for good ol times sake Or just go to Starbucks tide yourself over and find a real sushi restaurant

And about the Brioni Dont sweat the buyers remorse Itll make a great tax deduction to Florences"
5,Stay in the courtyard recently and have no complaints at all RIght when I entered the place  the staff greeted us and they were all very nice and helpful with everything Although i only stayed there for 1 night  i thought the rooms were very well kept and the bed was amazing The first thing i do when i check into the room is look at the bed and sample how if feels and this bed was amazing The rooms are about normal size and has a tv  desk  chair  etc Wifi is also a must whenever i travel and no complaints here Wifi was fast and easily available Did not have a chance to see the gym or the pool but they do have one Overall  i would stay here again if i come by Phoenix
1,I usually do not complain about bad food but the fish and chips gave my wife a serious case of food poisoning  So if some manager reads this please check out your fish supply or change the cooking oil  She never gets sick and has been sick all day December 29 2012 from the meal eaten December 28 2012
5,"Still in love with this place and how much care they really have for all of their clients 

I hit another I want a piercing moods and swung in on a lunch break last week determined to get this piercing I thought would be perfect on me 

As usual Jo was absolutely amazing He brought me back and we discussed what I wanted and when he looked at how my ear was shaped he said that I may want to try something like this then drawing dots where they would go He took into consideration my piercing past and said its subtleness and the petite jewelry would suit me well

And as always I came out super impressed and ready to show off my piercings They still look amazing a week later Im still in love and they are perfectly healthy Job well done But Im not surprised"
5,part of a social event we only had apps here quite delicious crab cakes and a shrimp fritters with mango sauce the portions were gigantic and actually big enough for a meal i was slightly full afterwards part of the roaring fork wildfish franchise they also offer a great happy hour seems a bit high priced but our bill was taken care of so id save this for the middle class foodie for a special event
5,"Okay I admit it  we are waaaaay late to this party We tried once before but the hourplus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day This time our strategy was to go early on a Saturday morning as close to 630am opening as possible We arrived around 715 it WAS the weekend after all and only waited about 20min for a table for two 

I had the special of the day  3egg scramble with andouille sausage fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese  YUM The sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked My companion had the hog and chick  awesome meaty bacon with that

Great value for the price  I packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home who could not be roused at dawn If you havent been get up early bring a newspaper and rest assured Matts Big is well worth the wait"
5,Busy place but everyone is nice and I keep having to go to the cell lot because of late baggage from my original destination They charge a lot to deliver so better get your bags checked 45 mn early
5,We love Dr Steve
5,"This mall has all the upscale shopping that you will ever need Just make sure you come here with your credit cards in check as you are bound to fall in love with something when you come here

They have some of the best department stores in my opinion and if youre looking for that perfect dress for any occasion you have tons of options to choose from

I love how clean and perfect this mall is"
5,This is a great Radio Shack  The staff are older and very knowledgeable with their product line  If you need odd batteries check this store out first  I needed a watch battery and found that they were the only store in Phoenix to carry it  It cost be all of 5 bucks but saved me having to buy a new watch
5,"Not only does this place get its ingredients directly from Italy it makes a variety of flavors fresh daily 

I got my first taste of gelato when I visited Rome Italy a few years back Ive tried other gelato spots around the US but nothing has caught my AMORE or the authentic Italian flavor more than Angel Sweet 

So far my favorite combo is the most popular Panna Cotta with Banana which an employee recommended Hazelnut and Pistachio as well as SUPER Dark Chocolate again with the Panna Cotta

Dont forget your punch card buy 12 and get one kids size free"
5,I LOVE LIFE TIME  Its always clean  plenty of machines to work out  on  that are in working order  HUGH VARIETY  of classes to take and keep you from getting bored  My kids LOVE it too and ask when we are going to the gym  They also have the rock climbing wall basketball and Squash courts and outdoor and indoor pool with life guard and a water slide at both  The out doors  and indoors have a lap pool as well   The inside has 2 extra large jacuzzi  and of course your steam room and saunas I personally love the locker rooms they are so nice to shower and get ready in they provide everything you could think of  just like a 5 star hotel   This place keeps me motivated You Gotta try the Zumba class and Strictly strength class
1,"My son and his family arrived into Scottsdale Tuesday April 10 on there way to California We decided to eat at RnR before they continued there trip  My son and my wife ordered a hamburger and fries The fries had no taste and my son asked for two new orders My grandchildren ate the original fries while the new fries loaded with Parmesan cheese The fries were not hot nor had the cheese melted I had a few of the fries and did not have as severe a case of food poisoning as my son and my wife 

I have recommended RnR in the past I do not think I will in the future"
5,"For those of you who love IndianPakistani food but hate dives ZGrill just may turn your whole world upside down In all foodie honesty ZGrill is home to some of the best IndoPak food Ive ever had This praise comes with a reminder thoughit is divey

ZGrill is located inside Zam Zam World Market which is a decent little grocery but it lacks the umph that other wellknown ethnic groceries delivery With that being said though other groceries lack ZGrill and this is why it matters

Everything Ive tried from the restaurant and I mean everything thus far delivers From the hummus to the samosas to the chana and even to the paneer masala and chicken karahi Ive only been disappointed when I realized that I was down to the last bite The flavors are robust the sauces are spicy and surprisingly the prices are unbelievably reasonable  Its safe to say that Im addicted to this place 

A word of caution when trying ZGrill They are sometimes out of items on the menu I find that charming cause they have to make everything from scratch others might not If they happen to be out of something do yourself a favor and just try something else

I cannot say enough good things about the food from ZGrill This is a musttry in the valley for anyone who has a love for spicy IndoPak food Go try it"
5,"EXCELLENT TRIP TO THE SPA 

A trip to the Aji Spa located at the Sheraton Wildhorse Pass Resort and Spa was at the top of my list during my recent trip to Arizona on Memorial Day Weekend We made our reservations well in advance Having gone to a few spa resorts I couldnt wait to pay this one a visit 

My cousin and I were each booked for the Little Yellow Bird spa package which was comprised of 2 services each We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our appointment time and was given a tour of the spa After changing in the womens locker room and relaxing in the private womens lounge area theres a large lounge area but its coed our masseuses met us and brought us into our room My cousin and I decided for our first service to be the Companion Massage After only having solo massages I was interested how a companion massage differed The 50 minute Aji Massage flew by My masseuse was professional and the massage given was very comfortable relaxing and beneficial 

After our massages were completed we had some time in between our next service feeling a little hungry we decided to grab some lunch from the spas cafe I ordered the flatbread pizza and it was TO DIE FOR Seeded flatbread topped off with a garlic peppery aioli grilled chicken pieces pesto sauce marinated bell peppers melted cheese and avocado My visit was a month and a half ago and my memory a little fuzzy but that was one of the best lunches Ive had in a long time 

After lunch sometime we each were up for our second service our facials Due to my skin type I received the Aji Rain Facial My esthetician was wonderful Her hands were soft and gentle while working on my face and we had some lovely conversation during the 50 minute procedure I left that room with my face feeling renewed clean and fresh

All spa treatments include full use of the spas facilities so we definitely made well use of that After our facials we used the sauna the steam room was out of service during our visit and whirlpools located on the womens locker side We then relaxed and lounged by the outside pool The Aji Spa is such a calm warm and relaxing environment that I ended up taking a nap Outside In desert heat Thank goodness for the wooden awning with misters attached and the huge patio umbrellas providing shade The staff at the spa provided excellent service From the front desk to our masseuse the esthetician the cafe staff and the locker room attendant While napping one of the staff from the cafe even brought us iced water with lemon and cucumber slices in it

Our appointment started at 12pm and with our 2 procedures and lunch we should have been done and out of there within a few hours But the point of visiting the spa was to relax and with Aji Spa being such a lovely place we just didnt want to leave  We finally left nearly 8 hours after our arrival and we would have stayed longer if we could 

I highly recommend Aji Spa to anyone visiting the Phoenix area or if youre looking for a new spa to travel to Aji Spa is a beautiful spa with excellent staff and service They even emailed me the same day of my service as a Thank You for visiting and included a discount coupon on my next visit A 5star spa indeed"
5,The french toast was delicious Toddy was especially good
5,This place is awesome Affordable tasty food  Simple and clean country environment
5,"Fantastic Happy Hour 36pm Half price appetizers and good drink prices I like their Sushi and Garlic Noodles

And pretty much everything Ive had there is good I had a Peppercorn Steak about 2 weeks ago and it was amazing Its right next to the movies so its a good place to meetup too"
5,"Went here for the first time last week and had a great experience The restaurant was very clean the service was great The best part The food Ive been in AZ for 10 years now and I can say without a doubt that its some of the best food Ive had in a restaurant and this from a pregnant woman no less 

I had the fried chicken tenders cheesy grits and fried okra First the food came out piping hot I mean steaming and hot to the touch The batter on the chicken was thick and crispy The grits were cooked to perfection dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist And the okra was fantastic too It didnt hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar either 

I will be back a lot "
5,"The boyfriend and I like to do little staycations every now and then so when we saw a deal advertised for the Camelback Inn we jumped on it We stayed two nights in just a regular room I guess They had several different kinds of suites even rooms with a private pool but our room was a standard room with a nice patio facing Camelback Mountain The room was spacious and clean the bed was comfy and the patio was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast

Camelback Inn was much bigger than I expected Lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property Its not the easiest place to find your way around but at least its pretty to look at while you get lost At the back of the property is a little ghost town set up It looks like they do corporate events  cowboy cookouts  but nothing was going on while we were there But we had fun wandering around the town and taking goofy pictures of each other

Even though it was December it was warm enough to hang out by the pool The pool is heated so that helped and there are two hot tubs as well for really chilly days They have an abundance of lounge chairs and even offer float rafts and fun noodles for the pool There were kids splashing around but the area is big enough you can hide away from the action if you prefer

We ate at two of the restaurants while we were there  BLT Steak and Ritas Kitchen and both were fantastic 

We loved our Camelback Inn staycation and would not hesitate to go back  especially in the summer when the rates are low"
5,"Yes the place is busy every time I go there and it takes 20 minutes or so to get your order
Yes the inside is cheesy and cheap with folding tables and could definitely use a makeover
Yes the location isummmwell lets just say its a working class neighborhood

BUT theyve got the best fish tacos Ive ever had and everything on their Mexico City street food style menu is outstanding The 1 tacos are minitacos so get 3 or 4 of them a couple of fish tacos maybe a side of rice andor beans and you will be all set

Go there Just leave yourself plenty of time its well worth the wait"
5,"FoodThe fire roasted garlic tomato soup is excellent  They sprinkle tortilla chips for garnish over a tiny dollop of sour cream  Mmmmm  Yummy  The mixed green salad with albacore tuna is also a delightful choice as is the turkey wrap and CA Chicken sandwich with pesto mayo  Drip coffee and espresso drinks are good too  Overall everything tastes great because its made fresh  No prepackaged items here

SeatingLots of booths and tables inside and out  They have a cozy little set up with what looks to be lounge chairs that accommodates 6 with swivel tables perfect for savoring your beverage of choice  The rest of the dining area looks like it has capacity for about 100 people if all seats were filled despite a placard declaring the maximum capacity is 311

Peak timesavoid lunchtime during the weekdays  It would appear that all of Surprise is feenin for a sandwich or soupsalad special from PB during 111PM  The lines are long and you can forget about getting back to work in under an hour if you factor in commute time food prep  consumption  ITS IMPOSSIBLE  The only time service has been fast is during breakfast  Ive been there for a breakfast networking event and on a Saturday  During these times I received my order promptly and had little trouble locating a table

Free stuffthis would include WiFi bread samples with tasty spreads muffin andor cookie bits  Bonus points for free stuff

PB is open MonSat 7AM9PM and Sun 7AM6PM"
5,"Awesome I highly recommend this place Incredible atmosphere inside and out the bar design is superb and the patio is the perfect spot for relaxing and enjoying drinks with friends I went for the second time recently and have to give this place a stellar review The menu is innovative and fresh The mixed drinks are killer and the wine on tap was an extremely pleasant surprise Plus you cant beat their happy hour seven days a week 

 I have had the crab cake BLT and the halibut sandwich which were both out of this world Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and I cant wait to go back and try all the others  The servers were great and knowledgeable about their menu which is always a big plus As a parent I love that this place is a perfect daynight out spot for a date or hanging with friends but also a family oriented neighborhood joint where I can bring my kiddo along Love that Churn is right next door to get some yummy dessert after an incredible meal  The design is spot on for this area Great job"
5,Thomas was very welcoming and a great serverbartender Came in close to close and still gave us ample time to enjoy our late night date My lady and is date night are few and far between so to be able to have a experience like tonight is very appreciated Kudos Thomas and citizen

5,"Lets start by disclosing that I grew up in New Orleans went to school in Lafayette home of the Ragin Cajuns and REALLY know good New Orleanscajun food I grew up eating great poboys gumbo red beans and wouldnt consider eating any of these if not well prepared That said I can truly say that Jennifer and the Flavors of Louisiana gang make cajun food as good as any youll find in New OrleansSERIOUSLY The poboys are spot on though the bread could be a little crustier and the chicken  andouille gumbo is even better than mineand I assure you thats DAMN GOOD Frankly Ive never had better The only thing that is not as good as it gets is the red beans and rice Theyre good but not quite the creamy Washday Monday staple that I grew up on My cajun grandmother has Jennifer beat on that one but not by much 

But if you want a special treat and want to taste something that kills all get a sausage poboy Hot sausage or smoked sausage poboys are a New Orleans staple and my favorite poboys of all But Jennifer blows them all away with her homemade andouille Simply put Ive never had better sausageever Its the reason her gumbo is soooo good and her poboy the best ever

Ive eaten at Flavors many times even though I live across town Every time I go I eat like a pig and bring some home to eat later I have no affiliation with the restaurant but wanted to post this as a review from someone who really knows New Orleans food and as a thank you to Jennifer and her crew for giving me a source for the best flavors in the World not just Louisiana As a matter of fact I even overlook the fact that Jennifer is from Baton Rouge instead of New Orleans or Lafayette and for not having any USLUL Lafayette paraphernalia on the LSUSaints wall At least that is so long as she keeps her promise to open another restaurant on the east side of townthat is a lot closer to where I live

If you want the ONLY good cajun food in Phoenix treat yourself to Flavors of Louisiana For me its just like a visit to any of my favorite poboy shops in the old neighborhoods It really is that good"
5,"great sports bar TVs galore Good food Outside patio While many places claim to be sports bars for some reason they wind up not paying attention to the TVs and wind up with hair removal infomercials playing

This place knows what they are doing with the tvs I was watching the manager who looked like had a spreadsheet with every game planned out and on what tvs They also play the sound from the premier game"
5,"Probably the best mall Ive ever been to Anchored by five mega stores  Nordstrom Nieman Marcus Macys Dillards and Barneys New York Its so big it took a couple of hours just to walk it

My wife called it the best mall shes ever been too Nuff said"
1,My wife and I have going to this restaurant on Thursday night for past three months to have a beer and a slice  A couple weeks ago I went there for the usual but there was an NFL game and a World series game on and the restaurant was busy  I put my name in and waited for my wife and the table  30 minutes went by and wife had not shown up and the table had just become available  Hostess said I cant seat you unless your other party shows up first  I called my wife she cancelled  Hostess would not seat me as a singleTERRIBLEHostess did not tell me this when I first put my name in  WONT BE GOING TO ANY OF THE ZIPPS EVER AGAIN
5,"I have tried finding a spin class in Arizona that is of the intensity and variety that this studio offers  Bar none  The CoreBalance Studio has dedicated instructors that push you to your limit in an encouraging way  The unique thing about this studio is they use the RealRider or is it RealRyder bikes that cause you to turn right and left to work your obliques

Outstanding workout I recommend it to everyone who wants to get into shape"
5,"This is another one of those restaurants I would have never known about if it wasnt for Yelp San Diego Bay Restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a shopping center on the main drag in Guadalupe

Its taken me a long time to review this place The first time I went was over two years ago and Ive been back a few times  I have to admit Ive never had better Mexican seafood 

Unfortunately since its been awhile Ive forgotten what I ordered I can tell you this though every dish has been superb Each bite was like heaven I left wanting to try everything on the menu 

The servers always steered me towards great dishes with their recommendations and Ive taken many people here much to their delight Theyve all raved about it"

5,What can I say about this place I love it Its straight up the road from my place You can find everything here not just Asian food When I get a hankering for Bombay spice off to Lee Lee I go I love LOVE their meat counter I get chills deciding which pork hocks I want The fish fry service is nice They have stuff I cant live without and cant find anywhere else ie aloe vera juice and those sinfully delicious dessert rice and of course the makoks The cashiers can be a lil raunchy though just smile and nod And a little known secret The vegetables are freshest on Fridays
1,I was excited to go to the lululemon athletica at Scottsdale Quarter because I really enjoyed shopping at the previous store that closed in Scottsdale Well something has changed I walked into the store and while there were more sales clerks than customers no one said a word to me and no one asked if I needed any help They were all too busy talking with one another And to add insult to to injury one clerk had to walk around me didnt ask if I needed help and went to play with one of the customers dogs I had fully intended to buy a Christmas gift there but left because the service was so poor and I did need help with the sizing   I went over to the Nike store and had a totally different experience very positive  Ill stick with Lucy and Nike where they appreciate their customers
1,"It saddens me to say that this isnt the worst Mexican restaurant weve eaten at thats on Oahu near Waikiki beach but its close 

 Damn it we had to drive by Arribas to get to this place 

  I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic though what there was of the filling was ok  beans  tasteless rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables

 Erins Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken Usually unless theres an attempt at chefing as opposed to cooking  Ill order a basic dish  I dont shoot the chef though  and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands  very safe  for the first time out  and if the beansrice suck no return

Overall It feels like aliens space ones are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures  Its certainly a mistake we wont be repeating"
5,We were in AZ visiting out for Thanksgiving and really wanted so go AZ mexican food but had to go to a place with a full bar for some Margaritas  This place came up on Yelp and looked interesting so we figured we would give it a try  The food was pretty good  My son had a cheese crisp wife had beef enchiladas and a chicken taco Motherinlaw had pork tamales and I had the beef green chile  They gave us to big baskets of chips and salsa which we eat too much of  Everything was pretty good but the margaritas were really good  I always try the house first time I go someplace since I think it is a good judge of how good a place is and theirs did not disappoint  I think they should advertise them more because they are so good  Very fresh tasting  Next time we go back to AZ we will definitely visit again
5,This place is perfect Great food great service and friendly people We will be back over and over again We ordered a few different things on the menu and all were excellent Stetson chopped salad scallops testosterone salad Lovvvve it
5,"I had a great dinner there  One of my best in a long time  It was sucha treat  Once in a while you have to take care of yourself and just enjoy what life has to offer  

Chef Juan was great to talk to  Seems this guy has been there sinsr they broke ground  

If you truely like yourself take a walk around the grounds after dinner and smoke a cigar at the big Fire Pit or over by the dock

Life is good"
5,Love it Closest thing in Tempe to the food we actually had in Thailand
5,"Love this place 

Food is spicy and always cooked just right  Menu changes every so often and have nightly specials too  Service is great  No matter what night you go it is busy

it is a great little find"
5,"Cibo Cibo Cibo  I love you and your cute old farm house your amazing pizza affordable wine awesome crepe desserts and fabulous staff

I want to live in the apartment above the restaurant 

Go to Cibo for awesome food charming atmosphere and a great time for a girls night or on a date  Cibo has quickly become my favorite place in Phoenix 

Theyre closed on Sundaysfound this out the hard way"
1,"La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem It cant decide what it wants to be when it grows up and that makes the overall experience iffy Is it a quick mart A grocery store A restaurant A coffee shop Unfortunately it cant be all of them

I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria when there is table service fun waitstaff and delicious food But during the day on the weekends the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate It is not set up for the crowd they do a poor job of line management and when there is a line to order the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate To top it off the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready Unnecessary

Ill certainly be back at night for the pizza the delicious wings and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO But Im afraid that I wont be back for the weekend chaos"
1,I found Gaylee to be the most unprofessional nail tech  I found her on an internet deal  I called her on Sat and requested an apt on the following Friday  She never returned my call till I reported her  She denied my 5 messages and said she only got one msg which she couldnt return cause she lost her voice  She conveniently had a voice after she was investigated  I would never trust her to do my nails  Yet reading the reviews she did return some calls
5,"Thanks for the positive reinforcement talk and explaining I just need to take my time Thanks Robin you encourage me
I have been sick and so has my family I have missed the last couple of weeks and boy can I feel the difference You know when miss something for a period of time Then you have to start all over but that ok
Thank you again Jim and Robin for taking those few extra minutes to ask me how I am doing and how my kids are since I have been gone Thanks so much for caring weather its about my kids or my knees or the fact that I have a pain pump in my stomach and   have a hard time laying on my stomach which Robin saw I was not putting full weight down on my stomach She asked me after class what was going on and if I was OK She made me feel important and cared about Where are you ever going to be working out and after class the teacher checks in with you to make sure everything is alright Jim and Robin Love this practice and so do I I feel what makes them different is the caring aspect The checking in with you If you ever have a question Jim and Robin will ALWAYS take the time answer questions or just see how you are doing Thanks Jim and Robin I will be back soon Thank you for being the best Bikram yoga around and thanks for just being nonjudgmental caring and hopeful for everyone in the class to push harder and just do it the RIGHT way Love your studio Love Robin and Jim as people This is the perfect place to either start or to be challenged
Thanks Nicole Skarderud"
5,"My husband and I have been going to the Touch of Thai for years We meet up there at least twice a month for a lunch date On special occasions we take friends and family there for dinner I love the wait staff  especially Nick His wonderful sarcasm and jokes always make our day 

For the amount of food you get at lunch at the price they charge  you cant beat it Everything is homemade and tastes fresh 3 Yellow Curry is my hubbys favorite Rich coconut based sauce with yellow curry The chicken is tender and the potatoes and carrots are cooked perfectly I venture off and try things from time to time The food is spicy I like the incorporation of fresh herbs into the dishes The soup served with lunch is always yummy and changes from time to time We always get a side order of spring rolls You need to try these I like the Pad Thai as well as the 5 and 7 lunch specials Meals are served fairly quickly 

Sometimes we have to get up and refill our own water glasses however I find this to be a wee bit charming Feels like I am home If you go there on a regular basis the servers remember you have your order into the kitchen before you even are seated and always say hello and smile"
5,Phok yeah and the spring rolls too 
1,"Tonight at Noca Phoenix
No dinner waited 15 hours with no communication only to be told they were out of the fish I ordered left the restaurant 2 hrs later very hungry   Very 
disappointing"
5,"I love Sapporo  They have reasonable prices a big menu great music always playing entertainment people watching etc

Their sushi is very good  They have fun drinks  

If you make a reservation for dinner you usually dont have to wait

PS  They have amazing deals for happy hour but get there early cause it gets packed"
1,Wont be going there again Our chicken was pink Manager was a prick in regards to that and service was all around crappy
1,Having a miserable experience flying from Boston to Reno My connection was in Phoenix and the flight from Boston was running a bit late I asked both of the flight attendants if it would be possible to deplane before the other passengers as I had a very tight connection to make One actually laughed at me and told me I would be fine 12 hours a horrible nights sleep as they did not offer me hotel accommodations and two delicious airport meals later I am sitting in the terminal waiting for my flight from Phoenix to Reno to board Sorry buddy not really fine I missed my flight by 5 minutes I would have been fine if US Airways offered their customers with tight connections the opportunity to deplane first as every other airline I have flown on does Will avoid them at ALL costs
5,Celebrated my anniversary here Everything was amazing Enjoyed the filet mignon and the lobster with prawns Luis was our server and made our experience truly amazing He made everything perfect He gave us our space but at the same time entertained us when appropriate He recommended a great wine to pair with the lobster and made sure we were well taken care We capped our meal off with creme brulee and a dessert wine We will definitely come back here and ask for Luis again
5,"Very small but wonderful food and wine Some of the staff mentioned that they worked previously at Bomberos Cafe  Wine Bar now Timos Wine Bar

The concept of this place is killer"
5,"The Harkins Camelview 5 gives Arizonans the unique opportunity to see movies that are normally reserved for screens in NY and CA Without this theater there would be very little chance to see independent or foreign films in Phoenix I give a lot of credit to Dan Harkins for keeping this theater open He certainly cant  make much money at this location Its financially  impractical to keep such a small theater operating on such prime real estate This just shows Dan Harkins commitment to sharing great films with the people of AZ 

Thanks Dan"
5,Excellent place for a nice dinner A classy place to bring friends for cocktails and food
1,"Went for lunch Took over 30 min for food to arrive Ordered chef salad Made with processed turkey and ham Also with processed cheese slices childs choc milk was not mixed up Kraft mac  cheese on kids menu 
Wont come back again"
5,I love the Valley Ho Its a beautiful property with great rooms a fantastic pool an excellent restaurant  Trader Vics and a really nice spa Be sure to stay in the newly remodeled Loft Suite Its two stories and its fantastic If I was to take a staycation I would be sure to stay at the Valley Ho And for all you outoftowners who want to stay in Old Town Scottsdale and be close to great shopping restaurants and nightclubs the Valley Ho should be at the top of your list
5,"Going to Desert Botanical Garden is the perfect field trip for a beautiful day like today Ive been to DBG a handful of times for events exhibit openings meetings and of course Yelp In Bloom a yelper party that I planned a couple of years ago but today I went with my son and we met some other friends with the sole purpose of checking out the butterfly exhibit

We didnt get lucky enough to have a butterfly land on us but we did see tons of gorgeous butterflies  There were orange butterflies and yellow butterflies and striped butterflies etc The flowers in the pavillion are pretty to look at as well  We visited the gift kiosk afterward and took home a butterfly finger puppet which I know we will get tons of use from only 625 The exhibit runs until May 13th so dont miss it

And if you do find yourself with more time while youre there definitely check out the design for a living world exhibit as well I saw that when it first opened and it was really cool  The photography alone is worth a visit

I just wish I had more time to explore DBG more often"
5,This place is awesome Just bought a loose super powers darkseid Will def be back for more Lots of loose figures Great prices and friendly staff
5,"This place gets it right from the moment you walk in the door Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver It comes with bits of egg and onion warm rye bread and bagel chips 

Our waiter Jeff was friendly and attentive even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb Our mains were baby back ribs the specialty of the house cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce The broasted chicken was to die for moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin The fries were piping hot as they should be And the portions are beyond generous

We topped it off with key lime pie light and tasty an ideal complement to the meaty mains And the bill was under 60 an amazing deal As a bonus some of the players drop in during spring training"
5,My family has been going to Dr Brittan for 10 years  He is an excellent dentist and can handle any situation you can throw at him
5,Love this store
5,"Im not a big organic kind of guy  I could care less about hormone free this and BPA free that  For me it all about flavor and service  it has to be better than I can make it myself and you have to take better care of us than I can

Having said that Im HEAD OVER HEELS in love with the food at Tryst  Service is family oriented too  They treat you like a regular on your first trip in the door and burgers are to die for

As a diehard burger man this is my default stop  It is close to the house in a pleasant shopping center and has the best burger Ive ever eaten in Phoenix  Id give it an extra half star if Yelp would let me  This place is that good"
5,After eating chocolate covered bacon for desert yeah thats really one of the options for desert I say that I was completely stratified with Becketts Table From the moment I called to make a reservation I knew that this restaurant was going to have great staff and service The staff greeted us at the entrance and give us options for seating I was VERY pleased with the pricing on the menu especially the wine bottle prices Its just a matter of time and I will be back for an evening meal Speaking from living in the Arcadia area this is just the restaurant we need in the areaa nice community restaurant with pleasing food If you are looking for a nice dining experience this is the place for you
5,The whole market is awesomeI like that if you did not bring enough cash with you that you can pick up a blue ticket at the information booth that the vender will stamp then hold your items for you then you may pay by credit card at the information table where you picked up your ticketThe veg are greatthe free range eggs are the bestthe french baker from Tucson is pretty darn goodthis market is for sure one of the better ones I have seenworth any one checking outNote support your local produce and growersfarmersSupport Organic One more note this information and option has to do with the farmers market out side open on the weekend from 7am to 11am
5,"The best fried chicken I have ever had
pork cutlet is not to be missed either
the collard greens flavor is unbelievable and purely vegetarian broth if you can belive that  absolutely no sourness

I regular have to make pilgrimages for my pregnant wife here

Negative  cash only"
1,"The food is simple pure and uncomplicated you taste and hopefully enjoy each ingredient However as with most minimally processed cooked foods it does not travel well  So eat in Luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure   

My only down note is on the service If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees As a result you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust or whatever makes you invisible wears off  Based upon my late lunch experience today the dust takes 4 iPhone email responses or texts to be removed 10ish minutes Regrettably I only had three unanswered emails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees On a positive note when you leave regardless of the time you waited the invisibility dust seems to be removed I know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver"
1,"For frozen yogurt quality I give this place a one Honestly its small theres very little variety in terms of toppings and the yogurt tastes cheap Probably because its a big franchise There is a reason why youre paying less for an ounce Truly  you get what you pay for 
The concept is neat sure but if youre looking for pizzazz then you should try Yogurtini Its just up the road from Yogurtland Anyway the single star says it all Eek Methinks not"
5,Ii am addicted  spectacular service and consistent quality food every time i have been ordering take out and dine in for months and grimaldis does not disappoint  only oncethey gave my takeout pizza to the wrong personchristine the manager very generously apologized comped my new pizza and bought me a glass of wine as i waited  grimaldis is a class act and has a fantastic staff with excellent food  every time
1,"Fake or rather condescending service from the Service Managerand he didnt even acknowledge me when I asked the status of my car uh more like IGNORE Ended every sentence with an impolite No maam or Yes maam ya get the scenario Basically the guy was a real JERK

They couldnt even figure out HOW to fix my car even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it  had been diagnosed at the Dealership Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer as if it was going to magically speak to them At least they didnt charge me but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes"
5,Obligatory stop for a drinkDodey is here so that is always good
5,"was i ever lucky to pick dr karawi from a random list of doctors near my home from my insurance website

ever since i was a kid i barely remember seeing my dentist his hygienist came in cleaned my teeth then the dentist came in with his long nose hairs and big belly and bald head and stinky breath and started shoving sharp metal objects into my teeth then he left saying only hmmph he had a beach house in the cayman islands

dr karawi is exactly opposite of that dont know if he has a house in the caymans though what really really really surprised me was the karawi cleaned my teeththe Dentist he does that for all his patients i asked him why and he just said he likes to get to know his patients how novel

he is extremely friendly and likeable but always professional he will joke and talk to you about your vacations plans for the weekend etc but then always keeps it serious when discussing your dental care i sincerely appreciate his services and friendliness we liked him so much even invited him to our house warming party

so for excellent dental care and outgoing service Dr Karawi is your man
ps hes not bald doesnt have long nose hairs or a big belly and his breath doesnt stink"
5,"We have been meaning to try The Mission for awhile and we were extremely impressed We are selfprofessed foodies good cooks etc
Lets start with the fact that they seated us promptly at our reservation time and that reservation had only been made that daysurprising because the place was packed Alfonso was our waiter and he was awesome and didnt hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner First the margaritas this place knows how to pour and they are fresh   the only way we will drink them Next  there are only 3 places in Phoenix that can make good tableside guacamole and this is the best of them Alfonso suggested a fried pork bellycola reduction appetizer that I had to be talked into OMGheaven and such a complex blend of flavors that the sweet crunchiness of the pork belly can only be described as worth it if you are balking at the issue of pork belly
Entree we chose the Chorizo Porchetta and the Scallops Both were excellent and may I say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt We never waited and yet didnt feel rushed
Dessert I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions and while other reviews loved the selections I wasnt blown away The churros were small and doughy and the milkshake was just to heavysweet after a mealbetter to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream Fried bananas didnt excite me either Bananas are bananas The pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and Autumnlike for a 110 degree day in Arizona and did not compliment the Latin flavors of the dinner I feel their dessert menu needs to be expanded in a way that compliments their cuisinesome citrus sorbet chocolatewithredchile cake lime cheesecake At any rate I still give them the full Monty on stars"
5,"My husband took me here on a Friday night after hearing good things about it from coworkers

We sat on the patio which had plenty of misters and overlooked a park it was a very relaxing environment

Our server Carla was as cute as could be and was so nice the entire evening She was one of the most attentive servers that I have had in a long time She was so genuine and really added to the experience that we had herethank you Carla 

We ordered a bottle of red wine that the husband picked I am not sure what it was but it was damn good 23 for the bottle As an appetizer we had the Piatto Misto which was an assortment of Italian meats cheeses olives  and breadsticks 14 and this is definetly enough for 23 people The meats were excellent and the cheese was tasty also My only recommendation would be for them to not cut the cheese into tiny little cubesthat was odd because the meat was sliced and you could not incorporate it very well

For dinner we shared a pizza The Sofiait had Scamorza Smoked MozzarellaParma ProsciuttoParmigiano Reggiano 13 It was ooh soo tasty We could not eat the whole thingthere was like 3 pieces that we ended up having boxed up

Then we had dessertI am still in heaven just thinking about this dessert It was the Dolce Della CasaSlightly Charred Sweet Calzone
filled with Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce and Banana topped with Vanilla Ice CreamOOOOOhhh my God This was by far the best dessert that I have had in a while It was so gratifyingI had goosebumps after the first bite I would recommend ordering a small and sharing it because it was huge 7 I can die a happy woman after that dessertand if this was a first date that would have been a guarantee for sex  

The community here in Verrado was absolutely amazing I wish I would have known about this neighborhood before I bought my house in Goodyear If you live nearby I would recommend checking this place out and spending time looking around the  neighborhood"
5,"Great surprise I have driven by this place several times food was excellent I had the Enchantment platter just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming

Cool cavelike atmosphere inside and fun patio area I will definitely be back and bring out of towners"
5,I love Stinkweeds  Owned by local commerce booster Kimber Lanning Stinkweeds provides better selection and pricing than many national vendors  The staff are helpful and if they dont have what youre looking for theyll happily special order it for you   The parking lot is smallish but Ive never had a problem finding a space  The central location is a big plus  They share the plaza with other locallyowned businesses so it makes for a fun shopping excursion  Their listening stations are wellstocked with a variety of music and the staff loves to talk music as well  They also carry a great selection of music mags as well as some books
5,Have you ever walked into a bar or restaurant and instantly felt at home  Thats how I felt when I walked into the Grind last night  The place has a great vibe fantastic food and cocktails and a friendly staff  Some of the highlights of what we ate last night  The burgers are phenomenal the cable car drink was unusual and tasty how could you not love donuts and the bacon oh the bacon  I highly recommend swinging in for lunch or dinner so it become one of your favorites as it is now one of mine
5,"stopped here on our way home on a road trip  if i had known i wouldve stopped on the way out too  the bear name drew me in and the assumption that a diner would have chocolate malts  

the food was fantastic  boyfriend ordered bobs big bear burger and it was probably the biggest hamburger ive seen in person  apparently it was delicious how he ate the whole thing i will never know  i ordered some sort of burger basket combo featuring a much smaller cheeseburger which was delicious hearty portion of fries which were ok and the chocolate malt was only 299 instead of 450ish  with the combo  And it was one of the best chocolate malts Ive ever had  And the prices were reasonable  And I actually loved the kitschy bear theme  Cant wait for another trip that takes me through Phoenix and I never thought I would say that"
5,We ordered seabass and ribs Both excellent choices Service very good Ambiance was unexpected Felt like we were in hawaii with an open feel with palm trees Used restaurantcom coupon Great deal
5,"Pita Jungle is a great place to get inexpensive Mediterranean food as long as you dont mind a bit of a wait

The food usually gets served up really fast but then your waiter leaves and never comes back  Im not ususally a stickler for outstanding wait service but I do like to get my glass refilled and be given my check in a timely manner

Nevertheless the food is so good it makes up for any other flaws"
5,Been there twice now  Great servers and the owner is a sweetheart  I ate the Pechuga Asada and a pupusa Locoyesp this time  The chicken was made right great beans and rice fresh avocado  big portions and the salsa and chips are excellent   I live two blocks from here and I need to wake the eff up and go here more
5,super great neighborhood bookstore its local and not owned by the man jimmy carter will be there signing books in febuary  They have new and used book and something is always on sale Its attached to wild flower and next to macs
5,I eat there about 3 times a week The antipasto salad and bread are addicting and cant be beat
5,Ive been coming here for yearsthe best  One of my favs is the lulu wings
5,This place had amazing food for reasonable prices They have tiny card games at the tables which was pretty neat too it keeps you busy while you wait for your food The bar was neat and the atmosphere was ok I did not enjoy the music and it was too loud to ignore The service was pretty good but the waitress made my friends and I uncomfortable like we shouldnt have been there It might have just been that one particular girl and I would still go back Dont dress too casual
5,"I had a craving for Mexican American type food and since there is no longer a Chichis around my friend suggested we go here since I was visiting the area from out of town She is a frequent diner here and loves it  I really enjoyed my experience as well 
I love a great Chimichanga along with  refried beans and ordered a much  needed strawberry  Margareta  So lovely I enjoyed everything on my plate

 I Loved it so much I suggested we come back my last night in town for drinks and appetizers
We decided to order the  Mini Chimi Sampler Macayos Famous Cheese Crisp that I ordered with ground beef it almost looked like a cheese crisp pizzaGuacamole Dip with chips They also offer free salsa and chips every time you arrive
Like my friend I would be a regular here I know when I visit my friend that she and I will go back at my suggestion and to  her delight"
5,Great place to grab a coffee with decent prices and a great atmosphere for sitting down to do some work or catch up with a friend Would definitely recommend
5,Recently ordered Spinatos again and just had to update to 5 stars as much as Ive always loved NYPD I have to admit that this really is the best pizza Ive had in the valley Its not fair to compare the two as theyre totally different styles but its just so good And theyre local Cant beat it
5,"We held a meeting planners luncheon inviting local clients to our hotel that host regular meetings  Our theme was getting to the core of your meeting and the entire event had an apple theme  Yuris Popcorn created a special flavor green apple for our event and it was a nice compliment to our other offerings  Our attendees absolutely loved it and were excited about all the creative and delicious offerings including centerpieces with an arrangement of candies and popcorn beautifully arranged into a bouquet of yumminess

Several months ago we hosted a lemonade stand for a client serving glasses of flavored lemonade  Yuris created another fun flavorlemonthat was well received by all

They offer the perfect gifts for clients and everything is very affordable when youre on a tight budget

Thank you"
1,I came here at noon during spring break When I walked in no one was there I rang the bell on the counter No one came out from the back I waited and rang the bell again Nobody I waited and rang the bell a third time No one I walked out having been unable to even find an employee much less place an order and try the food Pathetic
5,Friendly staff and great Americanos
5,"An amazing section of light bulbs for just about anything you need Most are in stock reasonably priced and ready to take home I have brought in several odd bulbs that I needed to have replaced with no markings on them  They always come through like champs 

Take my advice and covert your old bulbs to LED  Well worth the cost for me just to not have to replace burnt out bulbs all the time  some of my lighting is very hard to get to and Halogens are so damn hot"
5,Been twice Authentic high quality  great price for what you get Salsa de Chile de Arbol was the best Loved the decor Orchata tasted fresh which is a rarity in most Mexican Restaurants
5,Well I have been looking for a good barber and I have just found him Like many other of the reviews it is very hard to find a good barber and if your looking for one go here and see Phil I saw the other reviews on yelp and thought I would try him out I went and got a haircut wash and an honest to goodness hot foam straight shave hard to find now days and it all came out wonderful I thought the prices were in line for the area and maybe cheap for the service 3200 for all the services I think it is 17 for just a haircut I recommend anyone to go see him if you need a good cut or shave
5,"After a night of debauchery with friends my friend and I found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of Pho Ive been a regular at Cyclos for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new I was pleasantly surprised with Pho Ao Sen I am always happy when I enter an Asian restaurant and see Asians patronsprobably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes The tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed The decor had a modern Asian feel minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing  perfect for a Sunday afternoon

We ordered the Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien House PHOnomenal House special combination of sliced eye round steak welldone brisket welldone flank soft tendon tripe and beef meatball and the Pho Tai Sliced eye round steak and Goi Cuon Spring Rolls As with most Vietnamese restaurants the portion size of Pho is quite large and we could have shared Both were delicious filling and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering Ive experienced a few places that use a little too much anise so much that you cant get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation The Spring Rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the Pho 

I give Pho Ao Sen 5 stars Best Pho Ive had in the valley beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl "
5,"Consistent with the east coast stores great flavor selection friendly and accommodating staff  
The regular size doesnt look big but it is plenty for the price not to mention the staff consistently fills above the top the cup on all products  
A much better value than Cold Stone Baskin Robbins and self serve froyo"
5,I cant say enough wonderful things about this branch The manager is fantastic the other employees are happy enthusiastic and efficient  Not to mention that everyone there has impeccable manners and they treat their customers as customers deserve to be treated Go to this branch youll understand what I mean
5,Had the meat pizza last night and it was truly one of the best pizzas Ive had in a long time  The owner is always very welcoming and warm hearted
1,"what can I say about Glam well i really really despise it Every time I go there I regret the decision And in my grandiose style Im going to say why in a list

1 Cash only But listen to this the bartender will take your debit card charge you a fee and give you cash which you can then use to buy drinks from the same bartender that just did the whole transaction WHY 

2 The location kinda blows Its in a weird strip mall across from another strip mall Have you ever driven by there in the day time Its shady then imagine at night time

3 too hipster I feel like I am not allowed there as I work for the man do not wear black leggings or have razor cut bangs I in my mall clothing and mainstream style stick out like a sore thumb

4 The music is just a little off ii dunno how to say what I am thinking its just off

Okay the floor is fancy Thats about it

sorry Im a bar snob and Glam deserves my wrath"
1,Very loud crowded and quite unpleasant I felt very cramped and the environment was very uncomfortable
5,Great tire shop I brought in my car because I kept losing air in a tire they found a nail removed it and patched the tire in 10 minutes flat Very nice people and very fair prices
5,"Spotted Donkey Cantina is amazing  They have delicious Mexican food and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with You do have to pay for chips and salsa here so there probably wont be any of that four bowl snacking before your main entrees come but the medley of salsas it comes with make it all worth it

Ive tried quite a few of the dishes here and theyve all been excellent  In no particular order are my favorites
cheddar enchiladas with hatch chiles and ricespicy
santa fe macaroni and cheeseagain spicy
cod and shrimp tostadas delicious
shrimp fajitas
shrimp tacos

And for dessert
fried banana wraps or the mango margarita sundae"
5,Always consistent Great service great carne asada and a pleasant patio on a beautiful day
5,I had a really great experience at the Havana Cafe Everybody there was super nice and the service was great I dont think our water glasses ever got to less than 12 full The food was excellent Pricewise it was a little more than we expected but totally worth it The sangria and drinks were kind of pricey but ah well Overall a very good experience we will be back
1,"I enjoy falafels and my boyfriend really likes Gyros  So when we received a coupon for Daphnes Greek Café we were jazzed to go check it out

What I noticed right away is it has kind of a fastfood sort of feel to it and I thought OK its catering to people on their lunch breaks  However the food itself is like Greek fast food for people who have never had anywhere near really Greek food before and so they wouldnt know any better

The plates are astatically pleasing with everything arranged nice and neat  This amounted to zilch to me  When I got to eat I want plenty of food and I want quality as appropriately expected from the type of establishment I am eating at  

At Daphnes you get a few little thin slices of what may or may not be real gyro meat  The falafel meat is little over fried disks  Thats right disks  Not balls of falafel meat where the outside is slightly crunchy and the inside is meaty and moist  The pita bread is not  Its just some flat bread cut into little triangles  The tzatziki sauce is  what the heck is this stuff in this little 1 inch paper cup  The vegetables were fresh

There is more to complain about with this place but you get the picture  Im thinking that anyone who likes it here just doesnt know what real Greek food is like"
5,Gourmet markets to me are like candy shops to a sugar freak Hello my name is Thomas And I am a FoodAholic There I said it Do you feel better Huh Oh Sorry Didnt mean to get so defensive But how can you defend AJs How How I ask you Ok so its REALLY expensive And yes they should provide a blood donor center at the entrance to give cash on the spot for shoppers plasma I HATE huge markets Frys too big Safeway just right AJs just right and then some The produce section is perfection Not mounds and mounds of produce you know is wrinkling and rotting more than Bea Arthur in season 6 of the Golden Girls Cute little baskets hold just enough fruit and veggies to select from and not too much where you know its all riddled with germs and spiddle The meats and cheeses Oh my The filet at a whopping 3499 a pound is worth every bite Of course itll be a year or so when I would pay that much again Hello Blood donation station idea The ready made food is dee lishcurry chicken salad and brocolli delight to name two Yes it s called brocolli delight My gay ass did not name it I would have called it beautiful broccoli Just rolls off the tongue better Ive never had a cart wobblesee Frys reviewthey ride smooth and apparently are good for the enviornment Flowers baked goods dishesAJs Its here Im queer Get used to it
5,"This place is fantastic

About the restaurant itself  Its right by downtown Phoenix and in fact right next to a Light Rail stopso keep this in mind parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option  The place is seriously tiny only about 68 groups of people can be seated at one time  A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating which given the predictably large lines even on weekdays is a problem  The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait

Now about the service  Ive always had a good experience with the people who work here  The first time I came here apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated where I can go to get coffee in the meantime  She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and shell call me when my seat is ready in case Im shopping for example  The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging and theyre always smiling which for some reason makes the experience so much better

Now for the best part  I swear they put crack in their food because although their breakfast options are simple they are out of this world  The first time I came here I got the waffles  Perhaps its because they use REAL maple syrup or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown but they make the best waffles Ive ever had  I dont even know how one makes a good waffle really it seems pretty formulaic but its stellar  I ordered it with bacon which was also wonderfulthe bacon used was the good stuff not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket  Every bite is spectacular and when youre done youre full but not the kind of full youll often get at breakfast joints where you think youre going to explode or take a napfull but refreshed

The second time I came I got the pancakes  Not the best pancake Ive ever had but still superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof  The third time I went I got the waffle again see above

Before I came here I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city  Now Im worried there wont be anything as good"
5,I will continue to give this place five stars for so many reasons  First the menu is very creative and offers a great variety of healthy food with an Asian twist  This time I had the shrimp curry which had lots of fresh vegetables and instead of a heavy cream curry it was a much healthier broth curry  We had the edamame dumplings again which were as good as I remembered  It was kind of cool to see Dr Weil eating there last night  Its good to know that he likes the place enough to dine there
5,We used the taco cart for my 30th birthday this past weekend and we came away very impressed Eduardo was the guy that came to our fiesta and he was incredible When he arrived we experienced a haboob and he immediately stepped in and helped bring in our decorations and furniture He waited about 30 minutes until serving because we were unsure if the haboob was going to attack again My wife and I are both in the restaurant biz and so were many of the guests we all came away impressed with the food quality Next time we throw a party we will use them again Make sure to get the el pastor and carnitas Great job Hector  Eduardo
5,"I came to Timo for my birthday last week after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine I met up with the fabulous Jennifer T and I was so happy to check this place out

I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door I passed through the very chill looking patio area first another plus in my book Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off Inside was intimate but with the large windows it wasnt dark and depressing Like your own little happy wine bar world

They have an amazing wood burning oven Normally that itself is plenty good enough but then theres the food that comes out of that wonderful oven I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip which was the best I have ever had It didnt have a pool of oil first time for everything it was so fresh and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us since we were sitting at the bar I saw several other things flatbread  come out of that oven and I will have to go back to try them Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently better than baba 

Now for the drinks Holy cow Ive been drinking a few years now so safe to say Ive tried many many drinks Or so I thought Coconut mojito anyone Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka  As tasty as mojitos are I dont get a long well with rum so vodka was a pleasant surprise and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level I also tried the white sangria another 5 stars Great wine list too Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like and they have it  

The staff was top notch as well I arrived shortly before a shift change and both bartenders were personable and hard working and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing Im pretty bad with names unfortunately or I would love to mention them

I cant wait to go back For drinks and food I think Id even go alone for lunch if I didnt have any company"
5,Joes is truly a special place What makes this place so awesome is that you literally feel like you stepped back into an American farmhouse situated somewhere in the 1940s The employees are fully compitent in their abilities and they seem happy to work there They have homemade root beer which is very tasty and leaves a smooth and flavorful aftertaste They also serve Barqs Red Cream soda from tap which is impossible to find anywhere in the southwest The outdoor dining area has benches in a picnic style setting while the indoor dining area features a vintage John Deere tractor as the center piece The side dishes are kind of small one scoop so you might want to opt for and extra sidethe mac and cheese rocks I also recommend getting cornbread or lemon cake for desert
1,"I dont intend to return but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week my uncouth self doesnt exactly feel welcome anyway However Im not quite convinced that its my loss 

It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine 

Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot We enjoy good food and supporting local The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat 

While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly 2 for 1250  625 per scallop  is a tad steep in my book We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad 995 and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill 1495 

Heres the ultimate rub the bottom of the menu states no substitutions or modifications Since when is cutting a KFCsidesized ear of corn a modification 

At the same time the menu describes the restaurant and its offerings as Nothing fancy simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body 

It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it  particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate its beauty AND after weve communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items  is in the vein of nothing fancy 

How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves then 

The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFCsidesized ear of corn provided with our entree screams pretentious and grandiose and tainted our entire experience 

To quote my dinning companion You are not James Beard and James Beard wouldve cut the corn"
5,"Pita Jungle is a staple favorite of mine and my boyfriends Healthy hearty and great service Its too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up as have other restaurants but Ill still patronize this place Read as some things went up in price almost two dollars but you can still have a meal and a drink for around 10 more or less depending on what you order I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern  theres something about being by the lake that makes it special Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time 

Ooh  and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer "
5,"This is my parents favorite place to eat when they come to Phoenix so we dropped by twice on our family vacation The ownerproprietress convinced my mom in mandarin to let her pick the dishes for our first dinner so we didnt even know what would be coming The cold smoked duck was sooo delish as was the special mountain leafy green with bean curd shreds all minced fine and not on the regular menu There was also a shredded pork dish with bamboo excellent and a pickled vegetable with fish soup The soup wasnt really my thing because it was heavily seasoned with white pepper which I hate but the rest of my family said it was exceptional

Our second visit was for lunch before heading off to the airport for the return trip I could have eaten the entire scallion pancake myself as well as the cold spicy pork belly dish Luckily we ordered two orders of fried potstickers because those were delicious as well We also had some tasty steamed pork buns but I was stuffed at that point

If you really want to experience authentic shanghai food let the staff order for you you wont regret it"
5,"I havent written a review in ages but this place is SO GOOD that Id be ashamed of myself if I didnt review it

I am the most hyberbolic person in the whole world in the history of time but this time when I say that it was the best pancakes Ive ever had Im not kidding  Just insanely delicious  Scrambled eggs were also some of the best Ive had and come on theyre scrambled eggs so you dont expect that much variety and the breakfast potatoes were very good  I couldnt pinpoint the seasoning but its different than you usually get

Coffee  Yum  I dont think Id even heard of Arbuckles but apparently its got a great reputation and deservedly so

The owner Joe stopped by our table and was super nice and genuine  Service was just fine too

Im sure Joes will get a reputation and huge following soon so believe the hype and check it out"
1,My boyfriend and I tried this place last year and we havent been back since The food was really unspectacular they werent really that hot The price is a bit high since theres a restaurant by the same name on Southern and Dobson that serve much better food for less The decor was really tacky and they should paint over the mural it does not appeal to their clientele Lastly the staff was not nice
5,Fast service the woman who did my hair was great and it was the cheapest hair cut Ive ever gotten I was told that my hair cut looked better than when I was paying 200
5,"My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place Every time we drive by he wants to go in and eat Even if we are driving home from a dinner we just had 

1 The people that work there are AMAZING They are so nice and hospitable always glad to see you and let you decide the type of dining experience you want romantic date take out quick bar eats etc 

2 This is the freshest place for seafood I have found in Phoenix I dont know how they find half of the stuff the serve but they do and it is just off the boat I lived in Boston for 3 years and they get stuff I crave like Kumomato Oysters all types of fish and meat from East Coast farms 

3 Pricing is right onsince they are serving stuff that is difficult to procure I am always amazed at the value they present 


Keep Rocking Yasu"
1,The salad plates were not chilled As they usually are it however is a busy night but somethings are expected at the olive garden The food tasted like it was under a hot lamp for so long it tasted almost hard and also under cooked for the seafood Not a great experience at the olive garden there are certain things expected The expectations are not that high shouldnt be that hard to do
5,When people feel a cold coming they pop a zinc lozenge or tablet to boost the immune system I have a much better way to get my zinc supplementation I head over to Pier 83 for their terrific fried oysters With the first crunchy bite I begin to feel so much better Placebo effect probably But hey  as long as I get that feelgood boost I dont care The fish and chips are also the best Ive had in the Valley And to think that Ive previously been trying to get my fish n chips fix from the likes of Petes  yikes And their clam chowder is delicious I dont need to feel under the weather to have an excuse for ordering this tasty bowl of comfort The friendly staff and comfortable informal atmosphere complete the enticement for many return visits
1,"I always have customer service problems with Fedex  How the heck did they get to be so big with the crappy way they treat customers  I use the Internet a lot for purchases and about 60 of the time they screwedup and then their customer service has major difficulty fixing the problems  I have asked for shipments to be held at the closet shipping location to my office and they ship to my home  Another time I asked for the same thing and they held it at the regional depot instead of where I asked that it be sent  I can go on and on about the screwups I have experienced with Fedex  

But this time they really pissed me off  I get a harassing phone calls from a collection agency that says they have been contracted by Fedex to collect an overdue bill from me in the amount of 4000  I have asked them for details and all I get is harassment  So I asked Fedex for help and customer service told me to contact Fedex Revenue Services which I did  I told them that I am getting harassing phone calls from XYZ collection agency and the person who keeps calling is named Chris  I also tell them that the alleged amount owed is 4000 and the account is supposedly in my name  So I ask that they investigate and tell me if I indeed have an overdue account in my name for this amount  I know I do not have such an account  Fedex then tells me that they cannot help me because I have not provided enough information  WTF  How much more information can I provide  Do they want my height and weight  Maybe my blood type  Maybe I have to provide the names and birth dates of my children too

This is why I say that Fedex really blows"
5,"I was given a 100 gift card to use at Willow Stream Spa last December Ive been waiting for the perfect day to use it since then  Well guess what Today was that day

With my fiance out of town for the weekend I took advantage of some much deserved Gabi time as I like to call my downtime  I called a few days ago to make an appointment and I asked if there were any specials going on  Lucky for me there were several  The one that was most appealing to me was the book any 60 or 90 minute treatment and get a complimentary 30 minute treatment to go with it  I chose to book a 60 minute aromatherapy facial and a 30 minute complimentary massage to go with it I was in heaven

Ill back up a moment and just say that Ive been to the Willow Stream Spa before years ago  Today was even more heavenly than I remembered  I checked in around noon and didnt leave until after 6pm  I couldve stayed longer but I had to come home to take Minnie out

The Willow Stream facility is gorgeous and includes every amenity you can imagine I started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial  I had Tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck back and shoulders Ive been having shoulder pain so I think she customized this based on my situation  She was fantastic but with just 30 minutes it felt like a tease my facial made it all worthwhile though it was pure bliss  Heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job  I highly recommend her  she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders chest neck scalp hands and feet the products felt amazing and smelled good too  So much so that I bought a couple on my way out  

After my services I had lunch a delicious salad with veggies and chicken while I wrote some thank you notes and read my book It was so peaceful  It was like an escape from the world and I enjoyed every second of it

So bottom line  if you are thinking about getting a spalover like me a gift anytime soon Willow Stream Spa giftcards are always welcome what an experience  Im feeling energized relaxed and peaceful"
1,"I am floored that this place has 4 stars Literally fell out of my chair picked myself up then continued on to write my review 

The staff is friendly at this restaurant  Ill give them that Its relatively clean and has decent prices Thats where any positives end The food here is absolutely disgusting Nothing has any flavour  no flavour at all None Nada The salsa is peppery water at best the beans are mush and the rice just tastes like plain white rice I had a ground beef burrito which Id think would be difficult to mess up Nope Not for these guys The beef itself was unseasoned burnt 8020 ground beef There was at least 3lbs of sour cream And for Gods sake  even the cheese mixture had zero flavour Ive eaten better pizza boxes Pass on this places dudes"
5,Very friendly staff cute decor Small but dont let that fool you best sandwiches ever The egg salad sandwich was so good it reminded me of the egg salad I enjoyed as a kid Their potato salad is made there and soo yummy Talked to the owner and she was very nice
1,"HA HAHAHAHAHA 
Pit is right man this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasnt already expecting lameness
now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one but two dance club 411 and Level Peach Pit Afterdark I mean Cherry Lounge and Pit is beyond ghetto
opened by the same people who do sugar daddys and dos gringos this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial You know I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikiniclad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat well theyve updated the look of the cagetrapped gogo dancers to mini panties with kneehigh dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them

the vids of drunken loungegoers a la daddys and now dos playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing sexy things like sucking on lollipops cherries winking yes she was winking right at you wasnt she inviting you in to her reddrenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992

im not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line but the girl in front of me had on an oversized Tshirt baggy jeans and flip flops  and they took her 5 and let her in no problem i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundyno joke spandex black calf leggings long spandwex shirt in orange heels and a giant boob belt it was so incredible i took a picture she was not impressed with my observation so i had to sneak the photo

anyway take it for what it is a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave"
5,i love this place and eat there every time Im in the area  Pizza pasta appetizers all fantastic  Plan to spend some time waiting for a table  We always have fun just eating at the bar  Yumm
5,This is an awesome family owned business Weve had consistently fresh and delicious food each time weve been here They homemake things like their ranch dressing to take them to a different level than other places Highly recommend this place Prices are not bad either
5,"When cowboys ride off into the sunset they probably stop at Greasewood Flat for a burger and beer This rustic little bar is located a bit outside the city right near Pinnacle Peak and is definitely worth the drive Youll know you are in the right spot when you see the antique farm equipment and suddenly feel like you are walking up to an Old West saloon Say hello to the mule on your way in Outside they have picnic tables horseshoes and fire pits gets chilly out there in the desert and on the weekends they have live music and dancing 

Inside the bar is pretty small and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals For the nights without live music dont you fret they have a jukebox with tons of country hits The night we went it was the bartenders birthday and the regulars were definitely having a good time  

Both a historic landmark 120year old original stagecoach stop and a dive bar Greasewood Flat is clearly special to Arizona and is a definite must see Ill be going back on a weekend to get the true Greasewood Flat experience and hopefully see a cute cowboy or two"
5,Full disclosure one way or another I have only been to Roaring Fork for the Happy Hour but the happy hour is darn good You can and you should get that kettle of green chili pork or the bigass burger or better yet share the two with someone nice The huckleberry margarita is so good Ive had three in one sitting no I wasnt driving I fully intend to get over there for dinner soon because I keep seeing the sugar cured duck on the menu and just thinking about it right now my mouth is watering It gets pretty busy during the happy hour though so be prepared to wait a little if your party is large
5,i love the 5 happy hours all the dishes are a great value and delicious
5,Its high time I wrote a review for Desert Jade I grew up on their food So many amazing family memories were created here so its tough for me to go anywhere else and be quite as happy The owners know my family and are always ready with a hug This is truly a realdeal Phoenix institution I have so many favorite items but here are few musttries chicken lettuce wraps Id been eating these here looooong before socalled fusion joints like PF Changs had them on their menu sizzling rice chicken sesame chicken Desert Jade chow mein honeydipped chicken wings any one of their delicious soups So much to choose from and its all done exceedingly well with true consistency Support a local familyrun joint for truly fabulous Chinese food
5,I wish that this place were not so good  I have not been able to drink the coffee at my office in weeks  The location that One Coffee occupies used to be a coffee shop graveyard  Several coffee houses went out of business in this location unable to compete with Starbucks  One Coffee has bucked that trend and it is not hard to see why  One Coffee has great coffee and it is amazingly consistent  The staff is always friendly  This place is certainly doing something right everytime I go in there it has more and more customers
1,I bought a deal off of Living Social and waited a while to call them figuring theyd be swamped with business Now I cant get them to call me back so I can use my deal NOTE There were no reviews of this company on Yelp BEFORE the Living Social deal Of course Living Social is no help  their website says I need to call a consumer advocate in my area This kind of thing I predict will be the demise of every dealoftheday site the company selling the deal bears no risk of having to pay refunds if the business providing the goods or services doesnt perform I have since cancelled my subscriptions to EVERY dealoftheday email out there Lesson learned about TWO companies with no ethics
1,"The Duce is a disaster 
As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown I wanted to love this place The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service The parking is atrocious Its as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food They were out of just about everything we wanted to order So disappointing 
However I decided to give them a second shot Everyone has a rough night We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce Management needs to wake up Great concept Horrific customer service and staff"
5,"NOTE Ignore the reviews above It looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the Udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place Yes this owner used to own Udupai Cafe and Udupai Cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery  If you read my other reviews you know that Im critical and  my attention to detail is there so Im not one of these people who likes every place he eats at

Positives
Im Indian and I can assure you this place is good I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections I would be scared to eat there Woodlands is a nice CLEAN eatery in a nice part of Chandler  Its not a restaurant  Its basically a Dosa shop They  specialize in Dosa and offer several types They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes   The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions  This is a lunchlight dinner place  Dont think of this place like a restaurant  There are several types of Dosa and thats what this place specializes in  The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so dont worry about failing health codes hereat least not for a while

Negatives
Their nonSouth Indian dishes are not so good For nonIndians they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes  Dont order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer it wasnt good here   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isnt true he is kind of a businessman so he doesnt really care about telling you which dishes stand out  Stick to the Dosa and the Vegetable Manchurian  Their mango shake wasnt very good Their chiku shake is great"
5,Mail Call is a full service shipping store The owners are greatthey are friendly and accommodating I purchase shipping supplies from them are their prices are very fair much less than a larger place up in the airpark They take care all of my local needs and get the job done Kudos to Mail Call
5,I love the other locations of Thai Rama and this one is no exception Food is fast fresh tasting and well seasoned The lunch specials are unique and delicious and the service is good Far superior to the Chars Thai restaurant that used to be in the same location
5,This is a great place in an extremity of the Valley They serve both Korean and Japanese food They are quick and attentive Having lived in South Korea for two years I can honestly admit that this is some of the most authentic Korean cuisine Ive had in Phoenix I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I cant really tell the difference between Takamatsus version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific I noticed they offer a list of other more obscure foods I learned to love over there including naengmyeon cold spicy noodles japchae stirfried glass noodles and several other dishes They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes Love it or hate it kimchi accompanies every meal as do spicy bean sprouts a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides Its a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it and a complimentary spiced tea for dessert
1,Dr Pierrend is ok he will write prescriptions for about anything without really investigating if the are needed but he seems like a nice guy The staff are horrible They tried to charge me 2 times for lab results which are covered by my insurance Refused to give me the results without billing insurance for an office visit I would not recommend this medical provider to anyone Everyone in my family has gone to PMG and has a bad story to tell If you are smart you will look elsewhere for medical help
5,Fabulous place to get wine beer spirits  It also has amazing keg selection
5,"Best bruschetta I have had here Good wine selection as well

My favorite bruschetta are
smoked prosciutto fig mascarpone truffle oil
roasted chicken sundried tomatoes goat cheese
pulled pork housemade pesto roasted red pepper
mozz basil roma tomato qc olive oil  balsamic"
5,"If you want Cheap go to Walmart 

But if you want authentic eclectic trinkets that you will proudly own and showcase in your home this is the place for you"
1,"Very unpleasant experience Creepy male doctor Uncaring And no help

I went to this Urgent Care with a swollen ankle so painful that I was nauseous dizzy and having vision problems The doctor interrogated me and advised me to get my head examined Im not kidding 

Mom was right good doctors dont advertise This place actually solicits Yelp reviews"
5,Huge Fan of this place People in the food industry should take a lesson from these guys as they have great customer service Huge fan of the sandwiches
5,My daughter and I got a recommendation from our nail tech at Scottsdale nails WE LOVE VIETNAMESE FOOD and I was so glad to find this place It is as good as what I used to get in Oakland CA The location is a little strange but once you are inside the interior is nice and tranquil and the service is very friendly We enjoyed our noodle soup and spring rolls and we will be back for more
5,I have been attending Az Combat for the past 9 years and the instructors are fantastic They teach Kickboxing Juijitsu and MMA classes Az Combat was one of the very first MMA Gyms in Arizona and have a great reputation as one of the top 10 training gyms in the nation My daughter has also been at this school for the same amount of time and has taken advantage of many of the classes they offer including their boot camp I would highly recommend this gym for beginners and the advanced  looking to break into the MMA circle They have produced some of the top named fighters in Arizona
5,Delux is always really good fresh and its a clean place too I love the beet salad with chicken added Its delish My man digs the burgers and we both scarf the sweet potato fries Love their dipping sauce that comes next to the ketchup Ahmazing
1,"ZERO stars
I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago with a layover in PHX I have a couple complaints
One I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL One ended up being 14lbs over weight it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad I was charged an additional 90 on top of the 35 initially for the cooler to ship including the 25 for my first bag so 150 total This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge I thought overweight bags were charged an additional 25 like other airlines Ive had to pay at but 120 to ship one bag is just insane and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website On top of that I paid 250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were 400 total 100 more than my round trip ticket to fly I couldnt believe that
On another note the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent Ive ever dealt with anywhere She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldnt allow her to fly She raised he voice at me and called me a very inhumane person for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight seriously making me cry I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO This woman namecalling was totally inappropriate people in line beside me were astonished Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already and she was sick of fighting with me over it she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldnt let me on the flight and of course the gate person did
Between the dog crate episode and the bags I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees Im very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation
I have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline"
1,Bad food was horrible do not waste your time or money
5,"Nicely edited selection of mid to high end electronics    Knowledgeable and professional staff  These guys and gals know what they are talking about and will go the extra mile in terms of customer service  



Thinking about splurging on a home theater  Ask for Scott  He will listen to you and help you build your dream system within your budget  He will even respond to your hifi emergencies eg the guests are arriving for your Super Bowl party and you dont remember how to work the mission control style remote"
5,"chomp this is one mmmghgh good burger sllluuuurrrpp
Its got a great combination of yumminess with a side of chomp awesomeness The burgers are great and chomp perfect 

The custard is great lick and diabetic friendly mmmmmmmThey have no sugar added custard i would definitely recommend this place lick"
5,"I have been looking for a great therapist for a long time  Someone that takes the time to read my body to see the synergy of the muscles and be able to do the work  Finally I found Robert  

He has been an LMT for more than 15 years in the Valley and continues to educated himself often  His studio is located conveniently just off of the 51 about 10 minutes in a quiet residential neighborhood

The massage intake questioning was thorough but not invasive  His set up is calming and the room  table were warmed by a heater  The massage lasted 90 minutes or so I didnt want to go back to the real world  

He does offer Gift Certificates and has Pay Pal set up on his website if you didnt plan ahead with stopping for cash  

I will definitely visit him again when I need the work"
5,Just tried this place this afternoon Very friendly staff  great rates with no commitments You dont need to worry about paying some 2540 co pay like at a regular Chiropractics office each time you visit Its 49 a month and you get four visits a month Its not like massage envy where you have to sign a contract for a year and its hard to quit This goes month to month Try it out once for 19 if you want This company is really growing So stop by and see for yourself
1,"We ordered 40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours  was told 20 minutes We were not compd for anything When I expressed my dissatisfaction they offered to give me 40 credit toward my next order I asked for this in writing and they gave me the we cant provide it in writing  we wrote your name down and have you on record line

Guess what  I called back a couple months later and they had no record They refused to honor the creditand were rude I asked to speak to the owner and was told hes out of town The pizza is mediocre at best I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized"
5,By far the best taco shop in the valley Their rolled tacos are delicious Ive had them dozens of time and they never disappoint The restaurant is older and what youd expect of a normal taco shop but it is very clean and the staff is always very friendly They also have the best red hot sauce Ive tasted yet Yuuuuuuum
5,"I am impressed I finally got a chance to check out the MIM yesterday and I was really wowed by the extensive collection I knew going in to expect items from all over the world but there are literally instruments and related objects from every country We spent between two and two and a half hours but it still wasnt enough time to really take in everything

I loved that the audiovideo guide was included in the 15 admission price Most museums I have been to charge an additional fee This was unlike any guide I have experienced before No numbers to punch in just walk by any of the exhibits with your headset on and when you stop at each video screen the audio automatically starts up Very cool and I loved watching all the videos to learn more about all the instruments When I walked up to the flamenco part of the Spain exhibit I instantly recognized the video playing as I have actually been in the flamenco club in Madrid where it was filmed so I thought that was neat

I really enjoyed all of the exhibits especially seeing the guts of the Steinway piano and how Martin guitars are made Its not something I had thought about much before but now I know so much I think the MIM is a fab place to take kids and adults to learn and to get them excited about music Definitely check it out it you havent yet

Edited to add If you are a Bank of America card holder you can get into the MIM for free the first full weekend of each month in 2011"
5,"I really like this place 
Taking the advice of Yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown 
We were immediately greeted as we walked in I told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best 
Following the recommendation I ordered the Crackerjack cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce tomato onion and Russian dressing We also ordered the Godfather cappicola salami pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread 
Lets take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love It tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds You could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great 
I really enjoyed the Crackerjack The Godfather was good for a few bites but too rich for me 

I cant wait to come back 
Great choice for lunch downtown for a very fair price 

Unless you are completely starving share a sandwich"
1,"Pros 
No breed restrictions on dogs
Washer and dryer in unit

Cons 
Awful and idiotic leasing staff Forms will be missing or prepared incorrectly
Rude and inadequate maintenance be prepared to supply your own tools half of the time
Trash divers daily that no one does anything about
No onsite security you can call after 9 pm for a courtesy patrol but it takes them hours to arrive and the front gate is NEVER closed
Vandalized cars 
A MURDER this was the location of the man who set his pregnant girl friend on fire
The main pool is beautifully maintained and clean The 3 other pools are small dirty and frequently closed 
Bug infestations in most apartments
Dogs kept on patios 247 a clear violation of the lease so their barking can be heard by all
The basketball court and tennis courts are never available as they are constantly used by kids to bike ride on with the encouragement of the apartment staff
Tons of potholes Driving through the parking lot requires excellent shocks and there is minimal guest parking
The apartments have less insulation than a cardboard box Freezing in the winter sweltering in the summer Nothing is fitted correctly to its frame either 

If you can afford a better place I highly reccommend it"
5,Best noodles in Phoenix This place is hands down the best chinese food in Phoenix PF Changes has nothing on these guys they are fast friendly and food is hot Its also excellent for leftovers too
1,Have been in twice since my last review Its a like a COMPLETELY new atmosphere And sorry to say this is not in a good way Service was terrible and I was emberassed that I actually brought some new people with me to try it out Just went for this saturdays last ufc fight They were like natzis with the seating you have to have 75 of your party with you to get a seat even though my boys were parking and in the parking lot they gave our table away so after getting the tenth degree abou there seating rules we were finally sat all had to sit speraticly through out the bar We shouldve just turned around right then but decided to stay then on top of that we were sat next to some drunk beligerent people spilling and flirting with there server wich you could tell made her uncomfotable that table were continuosly getting over served beers Since there was not one mgr in sight the little time we were one of my boys stepped in and there was almost a fight right then and there putting that aside our service was horrible some dude was our server and we went without seeing him for like 30 min and not so cold beers At that point after one round of drinks we decided not to order food and the table next to us was gripeing about there food so that was another sign to get the F out of there so we paid once the server got back then bolted I wasnt going to yelp anything BUT I just received my checking statement and the dude added 5 to his 3 dollar tip I gave the guy 3 on 12 he was lucky to have even gotten that Im going to find out the guys name and go to upper mgmt because this is not the first time ive heard of this happening there With that said I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN This place has gone down hill  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE  Very disappointed
5,"Hands down the best middle eastern restaurant in the Tempe area  You cant beat the prices everything is always consistently good we go here about once a week

Favorites 
Hummus and Gyro Delux

Dont forget to grab some baklava too this is the best ive ever had and that includes having some while in the middle east"
5,"Primp and Blow at the Waterfront is divine I walked out feeling like a 
Super Model without spending a fortune Great Stylists Upbeat Friendly 
atmosphere Great Tunes and an overall GREAT VIBE  Convenient Parking 
and centrally located right near Fashion Square and Olive and Ivy LOVE it"
5,"My sister and I went here the other week and got gel manicures They turned out beautiful and lasted forever Ithink Biagio is now my go to nail salon 

Keep it up"
1,"If you are over 24 you are too old to be here  

First this place has beer  Dont order mixed drinks dont order wine both are gross unless your sole purpose is to get trashed which is the mission of every underage and young young 20something at this bar

This is the place youd go to with your fake ID because when youre 19 this is what you think a bar should be

Expect people over drinking and throwing up very early on in the evening in the bathroom"
1,I had high hopes for this place and it is really too bad because I love to support the Phoenix area restaurants especially a Caribbean one and I had already been to the adjoining Rum Bar and loved the drinks but the food was bad  It was not only bad but by all means avoid the daily market catch  It was not fresh at all  Very over priced  For nearly 25 for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bones out of the thing  It tasted like it had been sitting around all day or two in its own juices and when I let the waiterbartender know he just ignored it and then ignored us until we left  I will never be back for the food  The Rum flights are worth a trip there but that is it
5,"Hnnngffff their signature spinach pizza
Its the only thing Ive ever ordered there
And it alone warrants 5 stars"
5,"This place is fantastic Great food superior service gorgeous decor I had a Breakfast Casserole and a generous side of Cheesy Grits My girlfriend had the Blue Plate Special which was a frittata 
The Breakfast Casserole is a medley of sausage roasted vegetables and potatoes with cheese topped with a poached egg There were no overwhelmingly strong or weak flavors and I didnt see any extra oil in the dish It came with a side of toast I chose the marble rye and was disappointed only to see that the butter it came with was a hard stick The grits were definetly made with milk and butter and had some cheddar cheese sprinkled across the top The grits were more solid than watery which was a big plus for me as I prefer my grits closer to the drier end of the spectrum 
After breakfast I ordered a bloody mary at the bar inside and it was spicy and delish a really good balance of tomato to booze I liked it a lot What I liked the most though was the really good service and friendly attention we got from our server the hostess the bartender the bar manager the valet drivers and even being greeted by the concierge and checkin when we werent even staying at the hotel I will definetly make it a point to come here again"
5,"This is a brand new delicatessen whos grand opening was September 24th 2008  Since I dont have a kitchen in my place this reheat onestop shop near my neighborhood will be a place I plan to frequent via walking  

They have a cute cook book lounge and the deli layout is fun to just paroose  Their chocolate chip cookies taste home made  So nice to still feel like you have some input in the cooking preparation process when you live with just a microwave"
1,Cheap  Cheap  Beware  If you order Chicken McNuggets from this McDonalds they will charge you 10 cents for each sauce packet over the alloted quantity  Either go to another McDonalds where they dont charge go to another restaurant that values your business and NOT nickel and dime you to death or dont eat
1,Until they get their quality under control we wont eat here except for lunch We ate here last weekend and both had the roasted chicken The problem was it tasted like it was basted in cinnamon and the sauce for the risotto had at least 10 whole peppercorns on each of our plates I actually bit into to one before I realized that the sauce was just crawling with them They couldve strained them out processed them in whatever just dont serve me a plate with a bunch of whole peppercorns This tasted NOTHING like the previous visit when I ordered the same exact dish When we finally let the management know that our food was unacceptable he said the best he could do was a 20 discount Well we  werent looking for a free or discounted meal but rather some acknowledgement that they actually cared about the food That never happened Unless something changes the burgers are decent and that is about it
5,"holy shit i love this place

I have been a regular here for years Eating at oreganos after a long workschool week is really something to look forward to

The food is great Its reasonably priced the portions are huge and the drinks are tall dont expect anything CRAZY culinary creations here its just not part of the restaurants culture The food is simple and everything is tasty 

I usually go with the Sausage Sandwich or one of the pasta dishes with whole grain pasta and one of their giant meat balls Its always filling 
always good

Sure the wait is long but they always have free pizza drinks and deserts while you are waiting 

Service is always great Friendly prompt and they dont bother you when you dont need them All of the servers are always willing to play along with my friends and our inappropriate conversations challenges etc"
5,"My boyfriends company has been doing business with this PostNet store for the last 4 years Service is friendly prompt and helpful

I highly recommend it"
5,Nice Plaza  Very well located  Clean store  Friendly staff   All you could want
5,"Great place  nice ambiance cool decor tasty food and good service
We were going to check out the Spotted Donkey but finding it out of business we noticed Grassroots across the parking lot and decided to check it out  My daughter got the brisket sandwich she let me try a bite  nice combination of BBQ sauce slaw and pickles  but she picked out the pickles and slaw  The fries were quite nice as well  I tried the short ribs  asian fusion sauce with asparagus and jalapeño cheesy gritsIve never been a fan of grits but these were tasty  The ribs were very nicethe sauce reminded me of something my Mom used to make but I cant quite put my finger on what it was but it was familiar  A browned with toffee flakes and gelato on top capped off a very nice dinner  And youve gotta love a place that has the Gadsden flag as part of its decor  Definitely will be coming back  and my apologies to our attentive and helpful server for not having been more demonstrative of my appreciation for the foodit was quite good I just wasnt in a dang thats good mood last night  Check this place out"
5,"I work on a local event called Ignite Phoenix and somewhere in the mix we contacted Splinter Creative about helping us with the design and material for our event We were completely new to this game and didnt really know what good branding and imagery could do for us They stepped in gave us some amazing ideas helped us refine them and delivered some incredible material that wowed everyone who attended

So we asked them to stick with us for our next event and they did it again They keep upping the game and I now work with them across several different business that I work on  Theyve helped me through several difficult creative areas and the end result is always sharp professional interesting and engaging  

I prefer to work with people who are passionate about what they do and do it well  Splinter fits that bill perfectly  Highly recommended"
5,"I dont have much time to write this but I do want to say a few things 

I had four things so far here My friend and I both enjoyed them immensely I paid 16  tip 

I had the A1  Cha Gio  crispy egg rolls   A2  Goi Cuon Thit Tom  spring rolls to start

Oh man was this delicious The first thing I loved when I walked in was the ambiance Dim lit and let the sun do the lighting  very zen  if youre into that I felt very comfortable here

They had four sauces on the table I have no idea what they are but the one with red pepper flakes and oil  the darker one  oh wow If you like heat added to whatever youre doing  wow  this stuff is for you I loved it 

Then I went with the Pho tai  sirloin soup P2  Pho tai  wow  broth was amazing Everything was 

For me enjoying food means I need a few things 

First  awesome food
Second  ambiance
Third  presentation

They had it all I was very impressed by place to the plates Dont change a thing I hope  your business is very prosperous"
5,"The Valley Beer Drinkers Meetup Group has been coming here for months  since before the name change  on occasional Wednesdays for 3 craft pints  the fantastic wings special Weve always had a good experience and the extensive rotating brew selection keeps the venue fresh

Ive been urging the owner to add at least ONE Pilsner to the IPAheavy menu and last night he delivered with a quintessential model Munchener Spaten Pils It was great

Adding to the experience was the excellent food Portions were generous and satisfying One member ordered the Fish  Onion Rings and when it arrived two others immediately ordered their own I cant remember better fish pollack here or more perfect onion rings Homemade potato chips were remarkable and the fry cook definitely knows the craft Diners have many options for sides w entrees which is a generous touch Only the cole slaw was a bit bland 

Service was friendly  generally good but not attentive enough later in the meal Thanks for separate checks too

I really look forward to returning for brews and to further explore the enticing menu"
1,Do not get your oil changed at this walmart or any walmart We got a oil change and they dented our oil pan and now it leaks and they are not taking responsibility for the damages they caused I have only had my oil changed for the last year here and they are trying to put it off on someone else when no one else has clearly done our oil The insurance for walmart wont even look at my vehicle and had already decided they are not at fault I had a 3rd party appraiser look at it and they can only determine it was from an oil change I have no other option but to take this to a lawyer
5,The democratic party of Arizona consists of a nice group of  people I visited their office several years ago with some questions and they were quite helpful
1,"It was my Birthday and my wife her mom a dear friend and I headed to Flemings Steakhouse in Chandler AZ We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their unforgettable steak dishes That we did unfortunately 

The restaurant was lovely dimlit adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away No one offered to bring more Our waiter told us about the daily specials after which we ordered food and wine After a short wait four large dinner plates arrived I was the lucky one my steak a large  rib eye steak ordered mediumrare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate Nothing else on my plate just the steak I looked around at my wifes plate and couldnt believe her fillet mignon was laying there in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it be that a glaze a leaf a slice of whatever At the prices asked by this restaurant it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak We asked our waiter for a side dish mashed potatoes with Parmesan and when they arrived we couldnt believe it There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person Mind you they tasted good but at over 900 per side dish In short we left hungry and wondering why we spent over 200 for the entire meal

Next time well go to a well tried place for steaks and more Durants downtown Phoenix and worth the drive"
1,Terrible experience here They cut up my foot when trying to remove a callus Also they told me they used shellac when it was really gelish Wish I could recommend but I wouldnt want anyone else to go through the same experience
5,Food was really good Waitstaff were all really friendly and helpful in selecting drinks and entree Would for sure go back
5,"Mostly I love the Rokerij just because I love saying the name  

But the food is also killer  I had the most amazing chicken and the sides which usually I just take for granted as filler food were sodelicious that they caught my attention in a big way  I also tried my dates steak and while it was fairly spendy it sure seemed worth it

The feel of the place is great too with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded  We ventured downstairs to look at the bar and had we been there early enough to snag a couch I wouldnt have wanted to leave

It definitely feels like a splurge or somewhere youd take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow  Its manages a high end feel while remaining unmistakably local  I cant say Id suggest it just for any old night but it will stay on top of my list for special occasions"
5,This is a great MMA gym  Instructors are profesional the facility is clean and they work well with all experience levels
5,We have a show quality teacup Yorkie and a 5 Pound Maltese who has issues and they handle them beautifully The owners attitude is all about making sure you are happy and your dogs are too We were using a place across the street where the owner was all about taking your money and then booking you with who ever was available even if you had an appointment with a particular groomer These guys are the best they CARE and its a pleasure to give them our business Just Go 
5,"I live within walking distance of the Japanese Friendship Garden so I enjoy it frequently  Once inside its hard to believe youre still in Phoenix  Thats why I was so happy when Groupon recently offered a halfprice membership  I would join in a minute except theyre closed from May to October or so  Halfprice membership seems about right

The atmosphere is gentle and meditative  I feel safe sitting on a bench and actually meditating here  The koi kind of freak me out  Theyve been fed so often  by visitors that I feel fairly certain theyd eat me if I fell into the pond  Last time I visited there were baby ducks in the house  So cute and fluffy and they had no fear of people"
5,"There is only one reason  why I shouldnt love this pizza

Waiting an OBSCENE amount of time for a pizza is a pretty big one If this pizza was not as good I would be angry I think

I would tell you about it  HERE 

but you know what its that good I have had pizza around the world its not the best but this is pretty close to the best you are going to get in this area code I would love to say dont believe  the hype but yo there is a reason you have to wait sometimes as long as 4 hours for a pizza on a Saturday night

 Lets really face the reality of that night though You are gonna want to hang  around at other bars drinking with your friends anywayIts certainly not going to be a cheaper night of entertainment either Armed with that information you know what to expect While there is another place close by that is just as good but not as centralThis is worth it just to know what people are talking about

This Pizza is wood fired and made with world class ingredients The thin cust is perfect 
The service at least for me was rushed and sorta unplesant We were literally the last people in there by the time they sat us so I am not sure if that behavior  treatment is normal 

Not a place to pop in and grab a bite to eat with a small group but if you are REALLY not in rush then this place is one of the best in AZ"
5,"Cheese Curds   They have been so hard to find in AZ    Like the Jalepeno ones too

Really good fresh milk   Worth the stop

Bring cash not credit or debit cards"
5,I have lived all over the US and I have experienced extreme lows and highs with dentists but this dental group is by far my favorite I have ever been a patient of I cant say enough good about them so I wont ramble Just love them
5,Im really not the type to want to go out for breakfast Id rather save my dining money for lunch or dinner because I figure I can usually make just as good of a breakfast at home  However there is no way I could match their french toast it is just outstanding  We have been twice and I ordered that both times  The first time I told the waitress to put the berry sauce on the side because I usually dont like fruit toppings they are too sweet and fake tasting   But this sauce is delicious It is homemade and very natural tasting I ate every bit of it  We also loved the jalepeno bacon  My kids loved the pigs in a blanket  We had very nice service both times we will definitely be back
5,Are you kidding me this place is great  Perfectly sized bread quality ingredients cool staff  When I think dream sub I think italian night club no mayo and extra peppers  Dont get no betta
1,"This place is worse than the IRS at least the IRS admits when they made a mistake But these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say sorry for the inconvenience or we made a mistake  They gave me different information on two consecutive visits that I made then Dorrie some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents then after she asked me to wait by the counter for 10 minutes while their system updated

 I waited 1 hour and 30 minutes later I finally went to the information counter and asked for Dorrie I was told that she had gone to lunch 15 minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady She just dismissed me and I went to go talk to the new lady who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before I could finish my sentences  Basically i spent total of 3 and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and Dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride  not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say we apologize for the inconvenice  I recommend this place if you wanna be late to work 2 or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum"
5,In terms of Mexican joints this place is the best  With the outdoor atmosphere tacky decor and authentic food it just doesnt get any better  The other locations are just as good  The staff is usually pretty cool too although one time we waited a VERY long time to get served at the Scottsdale location
5,"One of the things I love about my neighborhood is that Cornish Pasty is win walking distance

Every pasty Ive had here is awesome My personal faves include the shepherds pie the chicken pot pie and the thanksgiving pasty

Yes its tiny and loud but it adds to the charm Also the smell that you smell right when you walk in the door heaven

We eat in and get to go Tip for to go have a beer or a cider w your wait"
5,An organized  clean store a well educated  nice staff a great selection of babykid products I will never go to a babies r us again Thank you Chandler buybuybaby
5,Place is awsome  Got the beef cheesesteak and everything was great  The bread was possibly the best I have ever had  Price was pretty good  Just over 9 bucks for a whole sammich and soda  While waiting I walked around and I plan on going back for some shopping  Lots of pasta sauces and just about anything you could want for Italian food  5 stars all the way
5,"Grew up in San Antonio and Austin Have traveled extensively and sampled BBQ all over the country The term Texasstyle means beef first Period And good smoke and that aint mesquite Oak is king These guys have changed the face of Phoenician BBQ forever Its a shame that the Scottsdale location was touched by  well Scottsdale Friggin morons If you have not been here you need to go down to 24th and E Roeser and try it Hands down the best Q in the area including Cave Creek The guys are FROM Texas and they know the whats wheres and hows of BarBQue 

And for those the meal in a carton on butcher paper snobs who think that such is declasse please do me a favor Head on down to Austin or better yet Lockhart Stand at the front of the line at Stubbs or Blacks or Kruez Market and loudly proclaim your thoughts as a BBQ aficionado Just let me know when you are heading down so I can hang out and watch the ensuing festivities Freud said it best BBQ and being horrifically anallyretentive is ALL about your unfulfilled dreams of your Auntie Ma Or shut up and grow up ya infantile gomers"
5,"Mmm dirty hipster bars  Let me count the ways in which I love you

You are cheap we had 2 Stellas
You are interesting local art on the walls that Im told changes regularly
You are full of pretension people watching is always worth the price of admission
You are friendly like minded souls can smell each other out

If you are in the Roosevelt district I highly recommend stopping in for happy hour  Its cheap and hipstery  Both words have been used to describe me so I am naturally predisposed to this place"
5,I try and eat here regularly Hummus is great Very personable staff And the atmosphere is awesome Look forward to the next time
5,I really love this gym It is so nice and well maintained There is always plenty of towels to grab before a workout  The childcare is excellent and has the security part down When you sign up as a member you and your child are given assigned wristbands to use during visits The staff have always been good about ensuring the numbers on them match prior to releasing my child to me You can even tune into the cameras to watch your child on the tvs that are on the cardio equipment Childcare is also open 7 days a week and doesnt close for lunch like most gyms There is also plenty of group classes throughout the day if you are into Zumba or cyclingetc I recommend this gym to anyone especially parents needing quality childcare
5,"Been dying to come here ever since I saw this place on Unique Eats Very laid back gastropub with a friendly funnyentertaining staff  We grabbed drinks at the bar first  Moescow Mule ginger beer cucumber lime rocks  the Persian Absolut Wild Tea vodka St Germain elderflower liqueur sweet  sour Persian cucumber juice lemon peel rocks which were both good not too strong but a good refreshing drink

Appetizers
1 Pork Belly Pastrami rye spaetzle Brussels sprout sauerkraut
2 The Original Chopped Salad
Please order both They were both delicious I was in love with the salad especially

Entrees
1 Lamb Burger Serbian lepinja roll pickled cucumberonion tzatziki Kennebec French fries  house made ketchup I tend to be very picky about my lamb Actually Im not reallly a fan of itthe particular taste and smell lamb has Why I ordered this I dont know but I can tell you that I liked it The tasteodor of lamb wasnt overwhelming and it was juicy
2 Pan Seared Scallops Hampshire bacon roasted corn grits wilted snow pea greens  Red Rock cola gastrique
3 Amaro Meatloaf Montenegro Amaro Italian liqueur pork beef parsnip meatloaf smashed Yukon gold potatoes roasted zucchini veal demiglace the server described it as very meaty and meaty it was Usually meatloaf is fluffed up with a lot of bread crumbs but this one was mainly just meat The mashed potatoes were very good as well"
1,Maybe their dogs are better but breakfast sandwiches at Nathans are disgusting The English muffin was spongy the eggs greasy the bacon undercooked And all premade and wrapped ready to melt together into mush with the cheese Yuck
5,"Do Taco Jedis work at Senor Taco 

Yes Yes they do

Is the force of making killer fast Mexican food strong with these Jedis 

Oh hell yeah

Try the shredded beef tacos in the hard shells When they ask you if you want hot sauce say si and drizzle it mightily onto the tacos Piled cheese beef lettuce tomatoes all stuffed into an authenticstyle taco shell  it doesnt get any better than this Just make sure you put a helmet on because its crazy good

If you like spicy nononsense burritos go with the Carne Asada Burrito Red Chile

If you like the whole meal go with the Carne Asada or Pollo Asado burrito combo plates The plate comes with flour tortillas beans and rice guacamole and salsa fresca You make your own burritos This is just good eatin Take it home crack open a good Hefeweizen and you are golden

And lastly from the sage words of my wife The shrimp tacos and burritos are certified gourmet meals Do I stutter Nope

While Senor Taco is technically fast food it does take some time to prepare If you do drivethru dont get all road ragey if it takes longer than it does at Taco Bell There is a price to pay to make good food and that price is TIME This is not a worldwide chain that spends more on advertising and earning your business by putting cute little dogs on plastic mugs Senor Taco is not that type of place A little wait is very much worth it

I realize that appearance of the location irks some reviewers Yes it is in a strip mall Yes it is 100150 feet away from a gas station slash AMPM mini market I get that But this is not Sanctuary This is not Kai This is not Deseo When one reviewer and I use the word reviewer loosely here hilariously claims to have walked in used his Superman vision to supposedly spot a family of offending microbes and without trying the food proceeded to sprint out because he was frightened of all the imagined cooties  well I just have to laugh Thats not a review its a driveby and reviewers like this are probably happier with Hometown Buffet or Lubys Cafeteria And thats too bad because this is excellent fast food

Ive eaten here maybe 1520 times and my wife has ordered the fish taco plate a number of times and neither of us has ever gotten sick The people at Senor Taco are nice the food pleasantly surprises and your expectation of fast Mexican food will be forever changed for the better I cant recommend highly enough"
5,Stopped in looking for some break from the heat after a couple hours shopping  They have a happy hour menu that we tried several dishes from and all were very good  Menu also has a good selection of alcoholic drinks nut we stuck to H2O hydration instead  Staff and management were very attentive  Would definitely recommend
5,"Ive been Dr Castillas office for 7 years  Her office has relocated and her practice has grown over the years and for good reason  She is a Dr that treats you as a person and takes her time to honestly answer your questions  She makes eye contact with you and I couldnt ask for anything more  Just remember it is a large practice and the staff is sometimes questionable  But shes worth the wait  
Now that weve relocated I hate to give up Dr Castilla  Shes irreplaceable"
5,there is none better  This taco shop is off the beaten path hidden and mixed in next to a smoke shop and behind a circle k  Parking can be at a premium but the payoff is the food  great friendly service low key on the inside and flavors and textures that rock your socks off  I mean really  My favorite taco shop in the valley or more to the point prob one of the best in the west  the burros are as think as a mans arm the tacos are soooo good i especially like the chorizo the lingua is good the carne is excellent  have a cane sugar coke in a bottle and find a seat inside or out you will savor the flavors and be sure to use the sides of grilled peppers and onions they make the meal for me  now where to go for lunch 
5,Such strange combinations of flavors yet they taste so good  Weve been here three or four times and are never disappointed
5,"Good reviews are easy to write Stop reading this and just go eat there 

OK well I have visited this place for years now and dont go anywhere else if I am in this area 

I like the Chefs they are friendly and quick They speak pretty good Spanish to me and but I dont dare try to respond in Japanese ha ha 

The value is phenomenal where can two people get miso soup salad beans tea ice cream and sushi rolls all for under 20 

Ive tried the same at Say Sushi in my hometown of Maricopa and cant do it for under 40 or more for two 

All you can eat is available but I find that ordering individually is more economical 

Great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner 

The waitresses are Asian and I find that suitable for the restaurant Some reviews on here complain about them I dont have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well 

I will keep coming back"
5,Thank you Jen  Mike for making what I expected to be a hard decision so easy My boyfriend and I will do all of our future shopping at this location Whatever you need here ask for them Jen is the store manager and Mike was more than amazing They told us that not many people knew about this location and I promised I would change that Make sure to post your awesome experience next  I love my ring
5,Best calamari in town and awesome service Tokyo glow is a great drink super refreshing
5,Yes its pricey so I got a membership Yes the membership is pricey  but if you go frequently and youll want to with the hot summer months youll get your moneys worth and then some The place is big enough that you can do different exhibits for each trip Great place to take the grandparents to watch the kids in their element too
5,We were greeted with very friendly staff  We had the fried knocci for an appetizer with a fabulous marinara sauce  usually do not order knocci but these came recommended and were very good  The bread was crusty on the outside  chewy on the inside very yummy  We sat at the bar as we usually do and the bartender brought over a sample of their meet sauce to try with more bread  I dont eat meat sauce but my husband said it was very good  I had a heft cosmo  my husband had a beer  For dinner i had the pasta trio that was fabulous  probably the best italian food ive had since the cioppino at Allesias restaurant  My husband had the linguine with white clam sauce also very good  Im certain these pasta dishes were homemade because they just had amazing flavor  I wanted more We finished with tiramisu that was also really great  My husband had coffee and even that was great  A little pricey in my opinion for italian food but due to how great all of it tasted   we think it was worth it  This will be a definite dining destination in the future
1,Experience with Hostess was rude Service with a frown Our waiter had attitude too It was a birthday dinner and we were in great spiritsso this review is written with clarity The margaritas were strongcheck ok there The shrimp appetizer was different and very good and 18 for four shrimp We ordered two mahi mahi dinners each 24and they were RANCID Yup I said RANCID We asked if the shrimp fajitas dinner had the same jumbo and they said they would have to charge extra each entree was priced at 30 we had to pay extra for the beans and rice that they had left on the tablewhich was cold by the time the shrimp dinnerwhich came with 5 shrimp and onions  Poor service with an attitude Mediocre food to say the leastall overpriced Never going back
5,"Great food their pork is awesome   The slow cooking made this dish superb   Of course the margaritas are as good as they get
Overall everyones food was tasty and the service was great  The place was very busy with allot of energy"
5,"I cant remember the name of the special salad we had tonight with Shrimp but I will never forget the taste  FABULOUS is an understatement  The NY pizza was equally as great  Every time I come here I say to myself we need to come more often  Everything is always good

Diane was our server tonight  What a cutie  More important is that the service was excellent  Diane was back at our table many times checking to see if there was anything else she could do for us  Another comment I want to make is there was a young man taking care of the table  At some point I thanked him and was surprised to receive Your more than welcome instead of the typical No Problem statement coming from young people  I should have gone to the management to tell them I was impressed by him his smile and mannerisms

We will be back"
5,"Like they even need another review  they have a solid 5 stars as it is

Just got back from my first visit to Adobe and I am beyond impressed My German Shepherd pup was having some stomach issues over the holidays so I decided to have him checked out to be on the safe side I knew he didnt have an obstruction or other emergency issue but I was concerned about parasites

The receptionist Hilary was super sweet on the phone and in person She was upfront with what tests she thought would be ordered and how much it would run me and it wasnt an arm and a leg the office call was only 56 I was very happy theyd be able to see me the next morning but then she called back not 20 minutes later with a cancellation and said to come on in Even better 

The tech was very good with Natelys 40 pounds of squirming and loved on him the whole time I was also happy they let me help hold him  Ive been to vets that called in a 2nd tech like the owners arent capable of safely holding their own dog Okay maybe some arent but I am and I appreciate being able to and not being instructed like a child

Dr Newland was AWESOME

The difference between him and some other vets Ive been to
 Other vets Oh my God we need to run 500 worth of expensive tests and start him on multiple medications general sense of admonishment for not rushing him to their affiliated ER clinic eagerness to run the bill up very few questions about anything etc 
Dr Newland  Super calm and personable He spent 20 minutes going over everything Natelys last few days of activity and stomach issues diet contact with other dogs where I take him in public anything he could think of really felt his abdomen thoroughly and said Honestly hes a puppy they eat funny things and something probably just irritated his stomach Hes plainly feeling pretty good so just feed him a bland diet give him this medication to settle his stomach and bring a stool sample just in case so you know for sure hes parasitefree  He also dispensed advice for Natelys general care as long as we were there about heartworm prevention and  necessary vaccines etc I even got a good education on the different types of parasites and which were even likely in AZs climate turns out not many I really appreciated that he didnt try to frighten me into expensive diagnostics and possible serious diseases and that he is so on his game and scientificlogical about things

I am very impressed and will be making Adobe my regular vet for as long as possible If only they treated birds too"
5,TS Glass did a wonderful job replacing my car window They came right to the house within 2 hours of my call had the window replaced within 30 minutes and treated me like a queen Frank installed the glass and couldnt have been nicer Thank you T  S Glass
5,"When I think Royal Palms I think romantic getaway A quaint yet exquisite resort the Royal Palms was built in 1929 to emulate a colonial Spanish retreat Colonial as in when the Spaniards were conquering the New World  All of the historical details are presented on a frescoed wall in one of the courtyards  

We had heard some great things about J Cooks and decided to spend a leisurely Sunday morning dining on the patio If youre looking to be treated like royalty you want to dine here

I enjoyed exploring the hotel after a luxe breakfast at JCooks  The staff are incredibly accomodating  What an ideal location for an intimate staycation  Its a nice place to go to grab some drinks and appetizers I will definitely be back to see what more the resort has to offer"
5,"I was there just last night and today received a ROTD for my original review Too weird

Updates  They mix a great margarita No fluorescent green pre mixed Margarita mix  they make it themselves with fresh lime juice Yum

The wine list is small but good My current fave is the Argentinian Malbec  Its only 6 a glass and they pour generously Very tasty wine

The seating is not comfy if you like to slouch If you sit up straight its fine But seriously good posture is over rated

It gets a little cold in there once in a while during the winter Wear long sleeves  After 3 glasses of the Malbec last night I didnt care

This place has really been growing on me nice to have such a great neighborhood watering hole"
5,Amazing Mexican food and the drinks are knock you on your ass good  Have the guacamole and a madre then come and talk to me
5,"I love this store  The produce is always fresh they have an interesting selection of frozen items including some great appetizers the meat department is outstanding  Ive tried a few different kabobs from here spicy kabob rocks bakery is great nice selection of hard to find dairy items like fig yogurt fair cheese selection including a local fresh burrata and mozzarella that will knock your socks off excellent selection of wines and craft beer and a floral department that has exquisite arrangements

Aside from the above they make great sandwiches have a nice salad bar have different take out dinners available every night have a pasta night and will make you a fantastic iced tea or an iced latte that rivals any chain  They also have an awesome grill  they will make you a kobe blue cheese burger that is out of this world  The hot dogs are delicious but they are gigantic and a little unsettling to look at

One piece of advice before you go not everything turns over quickly so check the dates"
5,Im not sure why it has taken me so long to actually go inside GoKatGo but I finally did and loved it  This store is filled with all sorts of great retro Hawaiian treasures along with a plethora of other gems  Weve got locally designed clothing in one corner awesome furniture in another tons of handmade accessories in the middle and bunches of fun throughout  It was really hard not to pick up everything in this store and buy it  The owner was really nice and offered to hold our stuff while we shopped  I ended up walking out of there with an awesome Dia de los Muertos pillow that looks amazing on my new couch plus a matching potholderoven mitt set in a really cool pattern  I will definitely be back especially since my other moms bday is coming up and she loves this kind of stuff
5,"Went back to True Foods  i have been doing this a lot since my first trip with my mom for dinner last week It was amazing as always however this time was different I tried a new menu item the Bison burger  i highly reccomend this it was so tastey and very light for a burger OMG I want to say that this time was different because we had THE BEST SERVICE EVER Our server Marcus was amazing He was very informative helpful polite and everything you would expect from a server and then some LOVE THIS CAT Just thought I would give credit where it is due Too many times you read about the negatives on service and not so often the positives I work in a restaurant and know its important for employers to know who their stars are MARCUS is your star A bright and shiney star lol

Loves Shitaki mushroom lettuce cups Ahi sliders Spaghetti Squash Kale Salad Raviolli Green Tea Coffe black and I always have to have the Banana chocolate Tart Definitely "
5,"I was really looking forward to eating here this morning when I got to the restaurant and found that everything was super clean and nice looking I had been drinking all night and it was time for some breakfast 

They had a great selection of hot tea The people in my party got quite a few things and everything came in heaping portions The French toast is the super thick kind and very fluffy They also proved that they can really cook eggs well They also brought lots of coffee and hot water for all of us

I also go their chicken tortilla soup and it was AMAZING

The service was super fantastic I will definitely come here again "
5,"Treated some clients to Sweet Pea Bakery items and they loved them  I got the PB  J cookies  Mojito cookies and Rum macaroons  Love that they are not the run of the mill flavors

The shop is adorable its actually really big surprisingly big  The employees are really nice and personable and that is always helpful and welcoming especially when trying somethingsome place new 

They even gave me a precious thank you card to put with the cookies  


I will definitely be going back for more"
5,"Its the best  Downstairs hanging at the bar you cant beat it  

The food is EXCELLENT"
5,Well this place is as good as it gets Family owned and awesome You know how at some mexican places the beans and rice are an afterthought Not here They are the best I have ever had yes even in mexico The food is seasoned perfectly and the service is exceptional Too bad they are closed Sundays The queso is the best I have ever had I could keep going but you get the picture Go there order and eat you will not be disappointed
1,One star is far more than they deserve  The owner of the property spent an excessive amount of time barking out reminders of hotel policy was rude to guests and his staff  The stay here felt more like being in prison with the warden constantly in your face  People in the group that stayed were locked out of the room by management forced to pay made up fines  The owner ruined the entire experience  If this is how customers are treated this place wont be around long
5,This is the best buffet in Az HUGE variety from veggie dishes fish shrimp mussels and even sushi The quality of food is very good too One thing I have learned is when looking for good Asian food look inside This place is always full of beautiful asian folks so you know its good Just sayin For a buffett they have a really nice staff There is a shrimp dish with a sweet cream sauce that is amazing It is more pricey than most asian buffets but well worth the extra few bucks I eat here at least once every couple weeks
1,"NOOOO 
Dont think about it

Had my windshield replaced by these schmucks The morons tore up the interior of my car and damaged a speaker cover 

I had to call them about replacing the cover thrice they finally did and then I found out that there was a HUGE air leak in the corner They never fixed the interior trim

They sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car ruining the windshield wiper covers and DOUSING my tweeter in water I called immediately after they left and got harassed by a manager because he just had hip surgery why is this my fault and couldnt come until a week out

Whatever incentives they offer are not worth the TERRIBLE craftsmanship and poor service 
I am exploring my options with a lawyer and have reported them to BBB"
5,This place is great They grow alot of the food they use and if they do not grow they buy it local The food tastes greatdont forget to get a milkshake It is also a great place to sit and eat outside nice
5,"I now have a sixth Sens for delicious Asian tapas a genre I never knew existed I always assumed the best tapas disappeared when Aaron May sauteed Sol Y Sombras last batch of buttermarinated brussels sprouts Well I was proven wrong when I hit up the ultracool Sens Asian Tapas  Sake on a Thursday night 

Guests are greeted by electric blue lights neon pink lotus blossom light fixtures and fresh beats courtesy of a hipster DJ which transport the hungry to an intoxicating fluorescent experiens filled with sauces sakes and spicy flavors they probably dont even know about yet 

I tried three topnotch items

Wasabi Tofu Hot in every Sens of the word Wasabi and 300degree tempura crusties have the ability to burn you to your soul if you arent careful Dont skip it just poke it with a chopstick or blow on it first 

White Peach Juice and Vodka Just like Japanese candy exchange students brought home in high school its one of those miraculous flavors most Americans will never have the opportunity to try Light and sweet but not overly so its a perfect blend you can sip allnightlong I did

The best by far is the Hot  Sour Soup Its nothing like the kind you get for 99 at Chinese restaurants as an appetizer A Bilbo Bagginsey cauldron arrives with a wooden ladle among the various veggies and discshaped noodles is your choice of meat I chose clams Ive always heard you can truly tell how talented a chef is by how tasty his soup is and would have to agree Theres nothing to hide behind and youre confronted by pure flavor It was complex different and mouthwatering

The whole Sensation was so genius I even got past the embarrassment of Chef Johnny Chu snorting in my face for taking pics of my meal on my iPhone"
5,"I have a serious Banana Republic problem Rewind time to about three years ago when I bought my first dress from BR I had just gotten my first full time real job after finishing college and I needed a wardrobe to match my new position It is now three years later and I have probably close to twenty dresses from BR The only issue I have is they leave me pretty darn broke so when I heard BR had a factory store I was stoked So last weekend I dragged my husband sister and niece down to Anthem to check this place out

It was crowded but the prices of the items definitely make up for it That is when you find something worth buying The selection of items is a little weird and you have to fight with many other women to get into the racks with the good stuff But I managed to find two 100 cotton dresses that are both casual and work appropriate at the same time Priced originally at 80 with a markdown to 40 on the rack they also had a 25 off sale on these particular items that day So I scored two dresses originally totaled for 160 for 60 Sounds like a good deal to me I wish they had more colors except that would have been bad for my credit card cause I am sure I would have ended up buying them all My husband also scored two pairs of jeans two cotton shirts and three pairs of boxers for under 100 

I can see myself making the 50 minute drive down here at least four times a year to see what new stuff comes in My dress collection is going to get larger this year I can tell you that Also if you sign up online for the factory store you can get coupons for extra  off your total purchase So your super discounted items just got even more discounted"
5,"I just had my first Tammie Coe cake last week for my birthday and I will NEVER be the same again  I dont normally eat cake in fact if its not Brownies I dont eat it  But this cake drew me in with its appealing fondant  From there I got lost in the spongy richness of the cake  A cornicopia of flaverful goodness

So make a metal note to yourself I will only eat Brownies and Tamie Coe cakes

Oh and special thanks to Arts G previous review for telling me what the hell fondant is  I was just calling it sheet like frosting"
5,This place is our go to mexican place I love the hot sauce and you cant go wrong with the Fundido sauce on the burritos I personally enjoy the Chicken Fajito Chimi with Fundido sauce It could possibly be the worst thing there to eat and I love it For the healthier days I like the Pollo Salad The chicken is always great here
5,Awesome food Highly recommend Had gyros platter  Generous portions and excellent meat  Check out their spices and other food stuff Got couscous very cheap
5,One of our favorite restaurants in the Valley We go here about once a month Some of my favorite dishes are the whole fish salt and pepper shrimp Pho with everything in it Spring rolls ShrimpPork over rice noodles and the Seafood over soft egg noodles We also have the Vietnamese coffee as our dessert YUM
5,Love love love this place Its a very healthy place to eat and always has awesome food and awesome service
5,"Its a nice newer gym with a good amount of amenities and a relatively friendly staff  I see cleaners in the club every time I am there which I dont see a lot of at other gyms  They have a stretch room full wet area with steam and sauna free aerobics classes  a large number of equipetc

The evenings do get crowded even with all the equipment so I try to get in and out before 5 or so

All in all a nice spot to get a work out in the area"
5,"Finally a teriyaki bowl place that does it right  Nothing against Samuri Sams but Yogis is a bit better in my opinion  Yogis  menu is strait forward and clearly lists the options available  The place is clean and the staff is fast and friendly  The food is also very reasonably priced  I was very impressed with their different bowlplatesalad options  You are able to order some teriyaki veggies chicken andor beef pretty much however you want it  Extra meat over lettuce over veggies brown rice white rice etc  

Anyway when I visit a place like this my desires are simple  I want a decent portion of notoverlysauced white meat chicken over a bunch of veggies  Thats it  Yogis delivers this and then some"
5,Fantastic venue The bartenders are nice the drinks are excellent The lounge is an amazing place to hang out best downtown spot even if you arent going to the show Cool free shows in the lounge Now lets talk about the main reason you would go there THE MUSIC And the venue itself is awesome The sound is great The ROOM IS GREAT It was designed by someone who knew what concert goers want an intimate experience with fantastic sound And so if you have the curse of ALWAYS standing behind the TALLEST DUDES EVER at shows you can now take advantage of the bleacher seating in the back of the room or benches on the side THERE IS NOT A BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE What is left to say  GET THERE
5,"I have been to every ballpark in the Cactus League and know my way around them all  This is by far the best facility in all of Spring Training that includes the Florida parks  Granted I am a Dodger fan and we get it better than the Sox fans do but it is still amazing

Camelback Ranch is the brand new state of the art spring training facility for the Dodgers and White Sox  The Sox moved from Tucson because Tucson is the literally SO bad that even people from CHICAGO wont stay there  The park is located just south of the Glendale Airport and pretty much only has one way in or out  111th Ave  You can avoid Camelback Rd by taking Indian School to 111th and then just drive into the stadium

The grounds feature 13 practice fields and a giant lake and river that also help irrigate the fields  While the White Sox practice fields and clubhouse entry are blocked off from the public the Dodgers are wide open and inviting  Players must walk through the crowds during practices which invited lots of interaction with the fans  

The field is beautiful and the layout of the stadium is quite impressive  Not only do they have a full Jumbotron but they also feature fully enclosed suites and a full buffet for those willing to shell out 90 per game  That price gets you seats behind home access to unlimited food wine beer soda and sweets  It also gets you exclusive merchandise as well as cold towels to help you cool off  It sounds like a lot but it turns out to be worth the money

The grass seats have a great slope to them much like Scottsdale and the seat aisles are wide  The food selection is lacking without Dodger Dogs however  The stadium is also missing the independent food vendors that Maryvale and Peoria feature  

A great stadium and surely one to visit every March"
5,"I was introduced to SanTan Brewery two years ago on a very cold winter evening My cousin knew I would instantly fall in love with this place simply because I just love fine craft beer

He was surely right because I visit SanTan three times a week because I simply cannot get enough of their beer selection Its like an adventure every time I go The staff is fantastic not because theyre very nice and friendly but they have the same passion and enthusiasm for fine craft as I do so relating to them in that respect makes the experience fantastic

I normally do not engage in writing reviews on websites like this simply because I personally tell the management team my best regards but I will for this because people really do need to experience the joys this brewery has to offer 

SanTan is the new level of drinking and dining experience Its relaxed fun mature environment and you can start a conversation with anyone there Enough reading this review go try it out yourself"
5,"Scottsdale Fashion Square is the king of shopping centers in Arizona Its unrivaled and it maintains its crown through constant improvements expansions and new stores Empty stores are rare Try that on for size PV mall 


The food court is decent but a wide variety of restaurants surround the mall providing the shopper with an endless amount of stores and a great selection of places to eat Scottsdale Fashion Square aims to please the most critical and goes above and beyond all expectations"
1,"Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we dont eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up The price was 1899 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food 

I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked 

I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and thats it 

So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it 

So how can they justify that price It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave

I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke 

FYI just because theres people with money who live near your restaurant doesnt mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering valueif you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhoodsame crap different place

No value means lost customers "
1,Music was loud as shit  The food Jesus Christ the food  Lame ass chips and salsa  No joke like 8 chips were on the plate  Salsa was probably one of the worst Ive had no flavor at all and warm   Salads come out warm Im assuming this is why Ive been puking  Gross right warm lettuce  Waiter lets us know they can make daughter a little quesadilla cheese only which comes out so greasy  Our taco plates come out 10 minutes later  2 dinky tacos on each plate that are flavorless and luke warm at best  Yes they are spicey no that does not mean they are flavorful  Im literally using my cell phone to see what was on the plate its so dark  Mint water was warm  Gross and not refreshing whatsoever  My daughters quesadilla was 13 yes for 2 tortillas smaller than my hand and some cheese  I get it make a dollar but damn dont rip your customers off  So over the top lame  Neither my husband nor myself finished   Meal was 46  Horrible  Health department should go temp that place Im not sure the refrigeration is working properly  Such a disappointment Ive been a vegetarian for 18 years was looking forward to a new spot  Wont be returning  Ever
5,"I have memories that make my mouth water  My mother calls me everytime she passes through Phoenix to ask me where this place is  She tells her friends in Los Angeles to come here if they have business or family trips to Phoenix  They all rave after their experience  

The fry bread house is as authentic as it gets  Indian tacos fry bread with sugar and oh my godthe red chili stew  I think I just drooled a little on my keyboard  

The place does get a little cramped during meal times but we used to take ours to go and sit in the park after a bike ride down Central and picnic away and then do our best to ride it off afterwards so we werent wallowing in the guilt of our deep fried pleasures  

Make sure they are open before you make the trek they have funky hours"
5,Culinary Dropout is a fantastic place to eat The interior is very rocker complete with  stage for bands interesting and yummy food with an array of beers  and amazing food If you decide to go which I dont know why you wouldnt  try their monkey bread for dessert it is to die for
5,As a massage therapist I normally would rather have a massage than get adjusted that was before Dr Hunt came to town  I trust him implicitly and the techniques he uses are amazing I take my four year old to see him too who always greets Dr Hunt and Larissa with great big hugs Highly recommend this office truly feels like family
5,"OK guys and gals too I know size isnt everything but OMG this place has crazy size portions and I loooove it  We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms 12 orders and STILL the servings were huge  Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer  They were great and tasty but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that  The calamari was decent could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce but for those who dont like a lot of fan fare with their food this would be perfect classic calamari with classic sauce  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim just how I like them  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni D  Both of them were absolutely fantasticyumm  And both were HUGE  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in very smart  For those with little ones the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well  Their chicken fingers are home made the pickiest of adults would eat these things no french fries home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets  This is the KIDS menu  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding  Great leather booths linen napkins white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth elegant but not stuffy  Guys could go in with tshirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up you can as well with out feeling overly so

I am definitely going here again what a find"
5,DELICIOUS sandwich prepared fast and just the way I wanted it  Ill be back for sure  Welcome to the neighborhood
5,I always buy my tires at Walmart but they didnt have a tire to fit my car They directed me to Discount Tire and told me that they actually have better pricing I went to this location and had the best experience They were very helpful saved me money and I was in and out in under 25 mins I will be back again and again
5,"This is the best library in the Valley and one of my favorite places to study  The interior design water fall glass elevators and many other features make this the perfect metropolitan library for our downtown 

The top level is pretty quiet and has beautiful views of the city  Quick Tip It seems that the southern part of the building is hotter because of the sun so I always sit on the north part of the building"
1,Ive never had a hard time at a sonic before except for this location They barely speak English they dont know their own menu and they messed up my order 2 times Come on your job can not be that confusing
1,Made me and my bro sick Tasted good at first but something wasnt right
1,"My wife and I were looking for a particular type of rose for our garden We called this location and asked if they had it in stock and what the price was They said they did and quoted us a price of 2499 for a gallon sized plant Good to go We drive there and find the rose bush but it is listed as 4499 So we go to the front and say that  we had called and driven 30 minutes to get this rose and we were told Oopssometimes the  prices on my list up front right No sht Sherlock Sowill you honor the price quoted NO 

So we drove down the street to A And P Nursery on Baseline west of Lindsay and got the same size plant that they were selling for 4499 for 1699 

Dont waste your time with these ripoff artists"
5,"Im in love Bacon you have my heart and my stomach After all where else does everything come with one of my favorite foods attached to it Even my Bloody Mary had a slice of crisp bacon in it along with a celery spear olives and onions Probably one of the best Bloody Marys I have had in awhile 

The location is a little off the beaten path which is why I think people are lined up to get in the Breakfast Club a couple of blocks away for mediocre food and here at Bacon the food and service is better and there was no line on the Sunday I was there 

I was seated in what they call the nook located on the side where I had full view of the restaurant The menu was well organized and entrees come with toast and breakfast potatoes and your choice of a side of bacon or ham You can also substitute fresh tomatoes if that is your wish 

The food came up quickly and was delicious My ham and cheese omelet was perfectly done all melted cheese and ham inside and firm eggs on the outside and the side of bacon was crisp and tasty Given the size this easily was a 4 egg omelet Breakfast with drinks ran about 20 which was cheap for all the food I got 

But I would be remiss if I didnt talk about what really blew me away about this place Its the fantastic service Everyone seems to be part of a larger team I was greeted by one person seated by another and had at least three servers taking care of me And countless people stopped by to ask how things were if I needed more water for my tea or if I wanted more preserves for my toast It was unbelievable While they have been open for 9 months they had the staff of a place that has been open much longer 

The ambiance is contemporary but is warmed up by the blue booths checkered table cloths and some mismatched dining tables in the center that can be expanded for larger groups There are also antique food cases lining the walls filled with tins of chocolate and other food cues I also liked that they have those roll up doors on the one side that bring the outdoors in and seats outside on those perfect days 

If I lived in Scottsdale this would be my go to brunch place What I dont get is why people are waiting in line at a place around the corner that left me a little cold Cmon people If you havent checked Bacon out you should After all whats not to like about Bacon"
5,"What can I say   This is awesome  I am a donut fan and would give Dunkin 4 stars just like this place  Great variety great coffee fresh donuts  The extra 1 star comes for the fluffiness of their dough  Its very fluffy and its done just right  

Dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and old when they have been sitting for a while  For some reason the Bosa donuts dun get too hard even after U buy and drive for like 12 hour home  I know its not located in the best part of town but they are open 24 hrs and there is a drive thru  They accept credit cards and discover "
5,OK OK as a Proud Italian I hope my momma dont see this Im actually going to give Dmoes a 5 star rating for a few reasons Last Friday me and my 2 brothers left the suns game and proceed to put a few adult beverages back At around 2am when Haneys shut down we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing Low and behold the ONLY spot that was still taking orders up to 2am was Dmoes Now 1st off  I live at Summitt by BOB These guys gladly delivered to me all the way down there Major props for that 2  They understood me considering I dont remember ordering the pizza I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad and me saying who ordered pizza then I burped wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo 3  apparently after checking my voice mail the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band in case you dont know were pretty awesome Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gents Kansas City Bullriders Well the driver and my door man both called 3 times Im assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out Maybe he had a slice with us Who really knows these things However I do know that I was insanely impressed with Dmoes from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember It was pretty darn good Between the awesomeness that is called their customer service and the legit taste it left in my mouth Im a believer unless if I say Im not will I get a commercial hmmmm Potential there
1,"I decided to try qwest as I was tired of Cox continually raising their rates

BAD CALL Cox may cost a little more but is completely worth it If I wasnt locked in to a BS contract I would switch back right now

Internet I signed up for their Heavy Duty internet  20 Mbps I regularly test less than 2Mbps on dslreportscom The best I have ever seen is a little over 5 When I call to try and get it fixed they tell me there is no guarantee on speeds That is why they advertise up to 20 Mbps

Phone Extremely poor sound quality very loud static and crackling shocking as this is what they should be good at I called to complain they explained we would have to pay to have technician look at it This was the day after install Helpful hint call back and tell them you want to cancel your account The customer loyalty group is actually decent they sent out a tech free of charge He fixed it after a couple of hours but acted completely put out that we wanted a clear line

The bundle Ah my favorite part and what has finally pushed me over the edge to submit a review  I went with a bundled package phone cable internet The plan I signed up for was 147 a month The first bill was 147 the second bill in Im at 27243 I cant make any sense out of the bill so Im not sure why they think i owe this much I love the fact that I will get the pleasure of wasting another hour plus of my day tomorrow talking to these fools 

The day this contract is up Im going back to Cox and Ill be happy to pay more"
1,Ive been boycotting this store since 2009  One afternoon after browsing for a while with my kids I allowed my 10yo and 8yo to stay in the childrens section to pick out a book to spend their allowance money on while I ran next door to TJ Maxx to buy the toddler a pair of shoes  Id been gone 30 minutes when I returned to find the horrid lady in the childrens section had called the police on us  She never asked the kids  their ages and didnt ask if they had a way to reach me they did  The police talked to them realized they were perfectly well behaved consumers and assured me Id done nothing illegal  Avoid like the plague
1,"Went here one night with a group of friends This place is pink crowded and really not that impressive I ordered some sorbet and it was bland  that in itself is an accomplishment  bland sorbet  The 50s style booth seats were very uncomfortable maybe to discourage staying long and the tables were the wrong height for eating I had to strain to get above face level of my food and im a normal sized woman It was also very very very loud in here

Ill avoid going here again The quality of the product was just too poor  Id rather hit up a Whole Foods and get some good sorbet without the discomfort and echoing nosie"
5,This is my favorite fine dining in town  I only go here 2 or 3 times a year because its a little pricey for dinner but wow what great food  Dessert is awesome here too love the Sundae  I just went here for my birthday last week and it still lives up to expectations although they dont carry my favorite anymore double cut grilled pork chop  They might start carrying it after they move to their new location though heres hoping  If youre looking for a classy place with great dinner dishes then this place is highly recommended just please dress accordingly and dont try wearing a hat not allowed
5,"This is a real find and I mean find  because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown Glendale This small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine not many polish restaurants around  The food is flavorful and fresh the soups are unique and tasty  The stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stewThe owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing  

My only disappointment is the limited hours I work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week  Definitely worth the trip"
1,I dont get it This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour No name tags on the employees I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled I guess I violated the health code Thanks for not locking me up I told my family we will not spend one more dime here
5,"Lee Lees finally expanded from their Chandler location for us who have loyally driven an hour to shop Low prices huge selection and it only took like a week for the place to smell like a true Asian market ie wherever you are you will never escape the smell of fish

I love it I bought ingredients for Vietnamese spring rolls two different kinds of curries a new motorpestle a Vietnamese coffee press and some various other vegetables and liquors hardly anything Also the seafood while I didnt purchase any looks very fresh

Wonderful to see such a great addition to west Phoenix"
5,I have been coming to Lux for years ever since I started graduate school here in AZ  What is there to say that hasnt already been said other than hands down it is my goto coffee spot in Arizona  Such a warm and diverse group of people rotating artwork the perfect study music playing in the background although it is played a bit loud espresso roasted onsite and baked goods made onsite  Always find an excuse to end up there for a café au lait or a velvet if I have a sweet tooth
5,I am in love with Yogurtland fro yo  It is super delicious and inexpensive  I got the coconut and added shredded coconut and mochi piecesyummm   Cant wait to go back
5,I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paws Salon I used to take my dog to Canine Preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey so I thought Id try a new place and I am SO glad I did The owner Tracy clearly has a passion for animals Walking in you are greeted by a cat dog and Macaw that call the front of the shop home You are able to see them grooming the dogs a big plus for me you never know what some places do behind closed doors She is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady in a good way Shes to the point tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help They keep track of the previous cut that was given its annoying some places you to have to tell them every time I would highly recommend this pet salon They also offer daycare and overnight boarding I cant want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more Cant go wrong at this salon
5,"A roadtrip would not be complete without local BBQ and Bobbys does not disappoint

Fancy smancy table service
Dark and cool with bar seating
Rotisserie chick and bragging about the ribs Alex was friendly and rattled off drink specials Other servers were chatting with friends at the bar and one blond one dipped into her cleavage for something I hope she washes her hands before serving up a meal Now I look around this is a breaking ground for hooters Low cut and falling out Not a fan of that 
Bobby Q Amber Ale Sonoran Brewing is too light with a bitter bite Not my type of amber but they tried 
2 meats brisket  sausage w maccheese andthe pecan coleslaw What the heck for 18  
Pulled pork sandwich 10
2 meat with pork and brisket 
Ranch House Salad
Corn bread pucks of sweet warm goodness

Sides were great The beans with zest the MC takes me back to old school cafeteria the potato salad was fantastic and the slaw was great with the pecan 
Brisket was the clear winner from the table and we all loved the smoky sausage The pulled pork was a disappointing third as it was dry Good thing I went with brisket 
Two thumbs up here kids Well worth your time and money Yelp check in brought a 10 off the total tab too"
5,"Say hello to the Ghost Lounge folks This is a brand new bar located right next to Seamus within the San Carlos through an agreement with the hotels ownership 

For years Ive thought the Hotel San Carlos was an underappreciated through its own fault downtown venue With the Ghost the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown Phoenix scene This is apparent from the first step inside the lobby which appears as it did in 1928 when the hotel first opened If celebrities in the 1930s had to spend the night in Phoenix back then a small unairconditioned cowboy town with around 50000 they would have stayed here Or else the nearby Westward Ho You get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blowups the Ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early 20th century downtown Phoenix So large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets and marvel at their bowties cowboy hats handkerchiefs and facial expressions Back then the San Carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was aircooled That may have meant it had swamp coolers I havent googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review

Id describe the bars style as grandiose and classic old school Phoenix with an obligatory hint of Chicago obligatory given the decadesold economic relationship betweeen the two cities that endures to this day It has been beautifully done I will be back often"
5,"Saigon Pho doesnt have a fancy sign great decor or even windows you can look inout of But who cares when you have the most amazing Pho in the valley and at the best prices The servings are very big and everything averages about 6 a plate Staff is very attentive and quick to deliver the goods

As you can read through the various other reviews  everyone has a favorite dish I have a problem with gluttony so I cant suggest a single dish  I can only suggest them all However this place also has some of the best Salt and Pepper calamari Ive ever had"
5,Great staff without an attitude which is rare in Scottsdale  As I was waiting for my party to arrive I was sitting outside drinking my beer and eating my food  Without ANY questions andor hassle my bill was transferred inside when my party arrived  Not only that but our waiter remember exactly what I had and was able to split it without me even asking him to do so  OK how great is that  I am totally sold on the service there an  I will definitely come back  Very nice unpretentious place
5,"Ill never forget my first Urban Cookie I was checking out after a successful day of shopping at Frances my favorite boutique when the girl behind the counter offered me some cookies they had out on a tray I hesitated at first because I was worried about fitting the new skinny jeans I had just bought but gave in after little persuasion

It was love at first bite After buying my jeans I rushed immediately to Urban Cookie and bought one of every kind Although it was close Urban Trail was my favorite 

I really cant help myself I keep going back for more plus the owner is super cute 

I love urban cookie"
5,This is thee place to indulge your sweet tooth Great ice cream and ice cream creations from an establishment with deep roots and long pedigree in the ice cream biz  Just cant be beat
5,"Another visit 

Greeeeeeat carne asada tacos torta and that orange cake Quesadillas pork and chicken were a great balance of cheese meat and sauce

That orange cake though Like I am one of those people that would do things for good carrot cake and the basic format of carrot cake done with oranges cream cheese icing and all was a wonderful flavor surprise 

Gallo Blanco looks like a top contender for Places to Take Visitors Just a very well rounded place to give visitors a taste of good eats in Phoenix and examples of well done and delish Mexican cuisine"
5,Yummy
5,My girlfriend i love love love this place Excellent food beers and wine to enjoy on premises   Friendly helpful and funny staff  A wonderful grocery to shop from and an amazing selection of cheese and wine  Its a total foodie destination  This place is fantastic  Ahwahtukee and Phoenix in general needs more quality driven food and wine centric places like this
5,I love Honey Bears  Ive been visiting their restaurants for years  Ive been to the one on Van Buran the one on Central and this one in Tempe  They have the runniest sauce on earth but dang it tastes great  I love the pulled pork sandwiches but not the long lines at lunch  When I went after 1pm in the afternoon I stood in a line of one  me
5,My favorite place in the world to eat Great service and awesome food
5,"Love this place I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside First I like the layout of this place very open and airy There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs I actually have been here twice so far First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend 
The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share ahi tacos artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced The ahi was fresh and chilled perfect for a warm day The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves Buttery and melt in your mouth good not chewy at all with no grit to most common problem I find The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl soaking up the juice My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table 
Now on to the staff all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer We also met one of the sous chefs Lennie A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes my grandmother remarked on them a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket I do believe he is right cooked to perfection slightly crisp on the outside warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking 
RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu If all the items are as wonderful as the first 3 I tried I am in for a treat"
5,"This is one of my favorite places to eat when I get back to town  Their beans are the best Ive had  Their tacos are made of shredded beef and fried with the fillings inside  This makes the best product  All of you lucky enough to live in the state dont realize how lucky you are to have this treat  Im usually not an enchilada fan but you have to try one here

Some of the reviews comment on decor  While it is true the place is a little shabby and the salsa comes in squeeze bottles I would much rather have their cheap prices than fine china  And that salsa I really would be tempted to steal one of those bottles but then Id have to check it in my bag to go back home"
5,"The line was ridiculous  The price is kind of steep for what it is  The dog is kind of messy because of the way its made  But you know what  I enjoyed it in a way I havent enjoyed a hot dog in years  Wow that sounds kind of dirty  This really is a unique take on one of the most common American foods

I passed through the sea of trucks and people that is Food Truck Fridays on a mission to finally try the much yelped about Short Leash Dogs  I cant say much too much that hasnt already been said  While the 20 minute wait wasnt too thrilling it all paid off in the end  I just went with a traditional wiener with tomatoes onion relish and spicy mustard  While I was intrigued to try some of Short Leash Dogs specialties most of the dogs on todays menu contained an item or two that I dont really like and I wanted to compare Short Leash Dogs to what I am accustomed to the first time around  Good sausage good toppings and the flat bread is fantastic 

I would happily join Lindsey F by tying my leash to the cart and following them around town  And I didnt even know that I still enjoyed hot dogs that much without a beer and a game"
5,"The staff is friendly and knowledgable and the sales on stationary are always welcome  Lots of specialty papers to purchase by the sheet or in packs of 25 or 50 with matching envelopes  Oh so easy to give just the right touch to my correspondance

Even when they are swamped with business the staff is always ready to lend a hand or help with a jammed machine

When my puter is down I rent one of theirs for just 10 and hour with printing priveleges"
5,"I went to Z Tejas with a bunch of people about 25 last night  We had a great experience from start to finish  

At the beginning my lady and I were early so the waiter got us our drinks and continued to make sure we were good to go  We wanted to wait for our friends so food wasnt necessary at this time but the drinks were flowing and the waiter Jeff was very cool friendly and down to earth  

All of our friends showed up and we let the good times roll  Chips and salsa drinks water and the delicious cornbread they all came very fast and it didnt take any begging on our part  

I got a chicken dish which was really good I stuffed myself silly  My lady got a side salad which was huge she couldnt even finish it and she said it was really good  Oh and the food came fast by the way surprising when you have 25 people

The overall vibe of the place is really cool very trendy and fancy but reasonable prices  Big screens everywhere gotta love that since there were some great College FB games on last night  

Great experience thanks Jeff  Z Tejas"
5,Amazing food I wasnt so sure about Indian food as visiting this place was my first time at both the restaurant and the food itself I had the Chicken Tikki Marsala and it was fantastic I cant wait to go back
5,This is a great little authentic Mexican restaurant  dont let the looks fool you it is delicious  I had the Tampiquena it is one of the best I have had  Highly recommended
5,Great food  Great atmosphere Great service  Definitely recommend
5,This is a dangerous place for me I could seriously do my bank account some damage as I love love love this store The candles are the best anywhere They burn very clean and the fragrance lasts until they burn out I just bought the kumquat scented candles and they smell delish Theres so many cool home furnishings here as well unique nonmainstream stuff thats fairly reasonable in  Ive actually got my eye on this really cool apothecary cabinet purchasing it may be in my very near future
5,The consummate beer bar  Great selection knowledgeable bartenders and eclectic patrons  What more can you want from a drinking establishment  The food is good too
5,Service at this location is superb and worth the wait when they are busy Price and selection are awesome too
5,"I have played this course two times now  From the moment you pull up you feel like you are at a private course  The staff is very friendly and professional  The views are breathtaking and both times I have played the course has been in impecable shape  

The course is challenging but still enjoyable  Lots of holes that are down hill great for long tee shots  This is one of my favorite courses in the area"
5,I liked this place The reviews show low stars but I liked it I was there for happy hour so go at that time The pricing is good I dont know about dinner but happy hour is cool  Servers were chill  Host was a bit stuck up Not sure why she though she was that great But the place is cool I recommend people check it out if they want to try a sushi place on the Mill ave when you are in town visiting Tempe
1,"My gf love sushi She made me a connosiuer of it and I have to be critical So many college kids love RA but its mediocre at best

Ill just list a few things that irk me
I went during a happy hour with coworkers It was PACKED Good thing right WRONG
Extremely poor service when I went in to meet coworkers who already had a table the hostess told me I have to wait When I said I have a table she got in my face I was tired longday and I wanted to chill I walked past her found my friends and she left me alone
The waitress took quite a bit of time to get around to my table and the sushi servings were OBVIOUSLY LOW
I went to Zen 32 and now my choice is SakeBomber their happy hour servings are much more than RA and their prices are BETTER

Be ready for loud noises as every one is trying to talk louder than the music and the person next to them

Just an overall poor experience and I tip on service 

Food quality was soso Just dont go during a happy hour which is the only time its worth it because its priced so high"
5,I love this gym Everyone is so helpful and friendly The gym has a TON of equipment and is always very well kept and clean I wouldnt want to go anywhere else I feel very well connected to all of the staff  they even know me by name The trainers are extremely helpful also I would recommend this gym to anyone and everyone
5,Kick  The Best of the bertos  they will make anything you want Carne Asada with Sausage  HamWow
5,"I love this place It first caught my eye driving to work  Their logo includes a shazzam lighting bolt which is rad if your into comics I went in the place and they had comic art on the walls The staff made some suggestions of what I should try I got the slider pizza  kinda like a cheese burger pizza they actually used a little brown mustard on top Anyway it was delicious I cant get over the helpful staff though It is very rare that I get that kind of service at a pizza joint

Any way every time I have visited the place there has been no patrons and it breaks my heart because that is a good sign that it isnt going to be around long 

If you get the change PLEASE check this place out"
5,"Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far  
Great tender meat in my pho chin nam 8
I see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so Ill have to try that sometime soon    
Nom nom

Friendly staff

See ya there"
5,"Alright this is the deal of deals 275 for students and Im not sure if its a quarter more or not but less 4 dollars half an ice cream cookie sandwiches trust me its enough  

Its a great pick me up for something sweet on mill

Cookies are made their along with the good ice cream and if your not into that they have italian ice

Place is small but is packed with flavor and smells like fresh cookies

Recommendation If you love cookies made into sandwiches"
1,Bad food but lots of it  If you have a hangover and need grease this is your place  Other than that drive a block and eat at Mucho Gusto down the streetnow that is real mexican food
5,"Stopped in for Margs and appetizers

Had 2 house MargaritasAM I DRUNK

Holy MOLY what do they put in those things

Food was great drinks were better Ill be back"
5,You cant give anything less than 5 stars to a place that sells bras and panties to hot chicks
5,Ive been to the locations in Chandler and Mesa and one word describes both locations Fresh  Their donuts are consistently soft and fresh
1,"We came there on November 5 2011 and the service was very bad The worst I have ever seen and we were treated like shit We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs Whites cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great The chicken was great but the customer service was so bad we will never return again  We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place Just because the chicken is good does not mean you treat people like shit 

We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal We dont mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone elses order it look like it came out of a box You can tell it was far from homemade it cleary was not bake no crust The gravy was watered missing favor Corn bread was over cooked under salted The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones elses cornbread I felt like we received the leftovers 

Truly the worst service we ever received The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice"
5,"Best donuts in the valley

I like a variety of donuts my favorites though are raised sugar and raised glaze and all the donuts here are great  Never too heavy always tasting fresh"
5,Pulled pork over rice with compelling seasoned tater tots rosemary  garlic  Gutsy sauce was utterly unique  Darryl King prepared it hot and packaged it with style for takeaway service

5,Fast friendly and clean  You dont get to say that too often when describing a post office  Serously though these guys are great
5,Papago Park is a great place to ride bicycles that is  The terrain can be as easy or as hard as youd like just choose your trail
5,"Ordered the famous Butter Burger medium rare Forget lettuce tomato and pickle eat this with cheese and maybe some ketchup to let that beef shine through Delicious Great diner atmosphere got to sit at the counter

Happy to see it was Niman Ranch beef a sustainableorganic livestock provider"
5,My wife and I as well as several of our friends drive from Ahwatukee on a regular basis to dine at Flos on Thompson Peak and Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd 25 miles isnt too far for this food Weve been eating here since the 90s and have always been pleased I discovered it when I worked in the area and used to stand in line for lunch it was so busy Our favorites Lemon Pepper Chicken with extra lemon wedges and the Kung Pow although I cant think of anything I wouldnt order
5,"Yogurtland as I say it with a highpitched tone in the end

This is my ultimate favorite dessert I would give 10 stars if Yelp allows it All my friends know that I am attached to this place We started this craziness together with my better half when we tried it a few years back after a basketball gameand all I said after first walking in was This is fun and we got hooked eversince That I collect their spoons only used by me and the hubbie and I now have 5 YGL  cups full of spoons I am the ultimate Yogurtland addict heehee We go as often as 5 times a week that we already know the staff in this location And we go that often that we even tried to abstain from it for Lent just to see if we can resist it haha Most of our friends also keep on asking to try other fro yo places to see if something will beat my YGL addictionand so far nothing has won over it yetD
So my favorite flavors are Taro Pistachio and Toasted Coconut and the of course the seasonal flavors Pumpkin Pie GingerbreadOh I wanna go now just thinking about it My favorite toppings are the yogurt chips sugar cone sunflower seeds shredded coconut and graham   Perfect blend of flavors 

So if you havent tried it yet grab your favorite partner and enjoy some Yogurtland"
5,Sara bartender is the hottest chick in the world
5,I love love this store Their reduced fat chicken salad and pasedena salads are to die for The prepackaged frozen meals are also yummy My daughter loves their yogurt and premade pasta meals Their clif bars are 12 the price as supermarkets The employees are extremely nice and helpful I would SO recommend this store to any and every one
5,"I rarely go to Indian restaurants But this is a place I love to visit often The food seems as if it was done with great interest When u go there order anything with rice They cook it to perfection I like their handi dishes a lot

If there is one thing I can suggest it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes No need to guild this Lilly"
5,I am a vegetarian and there is a ton of great stuff at Pita Jungle I just had the hummus trio babaganoush dolmas mozzarella and feta for appetizers tonight Fantastic happy hour on the apps and delicious Took BLACK BEAN BURGER to go SOOOO good Also servers are super nice and prompt YAY
1,All I have to say is what you see on the menu is not what youre gonna get and if youre ok with cockroaches on the walls and floors the this is the place to eat
5,Ive always wanted a family friendly jeweler  Esp if my at the time boyfriend was going to buy me an engagement ring  It means so much to me to have the true customer service when buying fine Jewelry someone I can trust  And when I found this place one day while I was at CVS I knew I had found a Gem pun intended Peggy really made me and my now finance feel like we were family  She helped him pick out my fabulous ring and answer every single one of his questions  Im so proud to tell everyone where we got the ring from because I think everyone should know about this place  If your looking for great jewelry with a warm smile head on over  They are so excited to help you
5,"If youve never had or even heard of bingsoo you NEED to check this place out I have two friends who were constantly bantering about bingsoo and this Fresco place I was excited when I found out it was so close to my house If youve never heard of it this is how it goes down Its a layer of shaved ice then you have your choice of ice cream or FF frozen yogurt your choice of fresh fruit off the menu apples strawberry mango banana kiwi and many others and then your choice of sauce which is a fruit puree of either strawberry kiwi or mango and honey You mix it all together and there you have it A somewhat healthy dessert They even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card  

This place isnt just all about the bingsoo though They have a menu of fresh sandwiches and fruit juices too"
5,Went here last night when on our last night staying at the Hotel Valley Ho  We were able to walk there from the hotel and it was so cute  The wait staff were helpful and gracious  Once we saw how large the pizzas were they accomodated us and split the toppings on each side of the pizza so we got what we wanted  I did think the olives were really salty but thats that type of olive  We had delicious wine and the bruschetta sampler  Enjoy people
5,"I have to tell you

I had their Jerk Chicken Plate the other night and it was yuuuuummmmmyyy You gotta try it"
5,I love this place the more I go to it The service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called Mexican Gumbo Holy schneikies its good Cant beat the prices either If I had a choice of this place over Chipotle I would choose Qdoba ANY day
5,Quick friendly awesome
5,"we only came across this place because an acquaintance recommended it to us Ive lived up the street from this place for years and never knew it existed its quite the hole in the wall and easy to pass by

The place was super clean and the owners did a wonderful job serving everyone in a timely manner and being super attentive We felt so taken care of  

I thought the prices were a little on the high side but when they brought out our meal all I could say was WHOAH The portion sizes were CRAZY awesome and my hubby and I could have really split one entree and still had some leftover 

The food was fresh the meat tender the atmosphere pleasantly divine 2 trips now and Im such a fan D"
5,We love The Olive Tree We call it the grill We eat there at least once a week  my littlest one has swim lessons right next door Both my picky eaters love eating there We love the chicken kabobs and the chicken shwarmasp Family ran great food we love it
1,"Mucho Gusto es mucho mierda 

Let me say first that the place is cute the staff is friendly and the salsa is good There Im not being a total jerk 

The food however left much to be desired I couldnt find much to like about my chicken tacos they were ok but the meat didnt have much flavor there was no cheese and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico What really got me was that they didnt come with rice and beans Instead I got a lovely pile of cheap bagged romaine coated in some sort of caesarish dressing Sure there were a few cubes of cheese and a tomato slice A slice on top but come on 14 for a couple of naked tacos and a pile of romaine For that much they could have at least picked the white core parts of the lettuce out of my salad Or I dunno sprinkled a little cheese on the tacos

The story was much the same with the fish tacos only the salad was different The enchiladas seemed to be a hit and those are served with rice and beans the vegan at the table ordered a side of rice and beans for her meal and they arent kidding about it being a side I think my cats food bowl is bigger 

They charge 1 per bowl if you want more chips I know 1 isnt a big deal but its just the principle I already felt ripped off from the entree so the extra charge for the chips just made it worse 

Needless to say I wont be going back There are far better choices closer to home"
1,"1030pm on a Saturday night  My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night see my review of Pearl for the first  Place is hopping  We take a seat at the sushi bar

The Waitress  Are you girls going to be ordering sushi
Me I have a sushi menu in my hand yes
Waitress  Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too
Me What the fuck bitch Uh ok

Dear Ra Waitress

Im sorry if I kept you or any other employess especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed  It was completely ok to rush me even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine  I was hardly the last customer in there  There were people all around me ordering sushi so Im still unclear as to why you needed to rush me  If you were in such a hurry why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food  Maybe it was because you dont know how to count since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldnt count it on the spot  I like Ra for the atmosphere something you completely ruined  Thanks for that   

Sincerely
Morgan"
5,"Of course they are no La Madeliene but if you are looking for some good croissants this is the place to be I love love love their croissants But which bakerys croissants do I not love hmm But I do love theirs I have had the almond croissant the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there I had the chocolate croissant It was just freaking amazing Thats all I can say They run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some

I have also had lunch here before some Mediterranean sandwich stuff The portion is very small compared to the price Their macaroons look crazy and funky Have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time I almost gave them 4 stars because their hours they are open are very weird But its okay I will compromise Essence Bakery 

They only use butter imported from Normandy in their Croissants Wow"
5,"Went early  to North for the New Years eve special menu 3rd time dining here They did not have to have great service or food on a yearly event but as with the previous meals it was outstanding Hubby had the misto fritto they always do the crisp calamari perfect Enough just to make a special trip for it I had the beef carpaccio buttery and flavorful The apple cider pork tenderloin was tender moist and it was a huge portion My hubby was stuffed but did not stop eating until it was all gone Oink I had the scallops Always a favorite of mine They usually have it on the menu and often in a variation as a special We both had the hazelnut chocolate cake Sinfully rich We were both too full to eat but a bite and finished at home for the New Years countdown 
We really enjoy our dining at North and have been very fortunate at several other Fox restaurants"
5,I was in Vietnam last May and spent every summer in Westminster CA growing up so to qualify my 5 stars Woohoo As good as it gets  I say to whats available of what Ive seen in PHX area  With that said Ive had the Bun Bo Hue Pho Tai Com Tam Dac Biet Bun bi cha gio and agree with what everyone said about cleanliness freshness of condiments integrity of broth  lack of oiliness  and general flavor  The only thing that didnt rock my world was the bahn mi sandwiches cant vouch for the assorted outsourced items in the chilled section either  Besides that If you want Viet food this is your place for the PHX metro area
5,Staff was quick and efficient Food was delicious
5,I tired they chicken smash burger WOOHOO  LOVE IT  Crispy chicken not too think not too thick but perfectly crispy  I ordered the build your own  Egg bun crispy chicken mayo and swiss cheese  HELLO MAMA  The smash fries were good  The staff is always friendly
1,"My significant other had a 25 off coupon from Restaurantcom LOL That could sum up the whole trip I havent been to many restaurants that participate with restaurantcom that are decent at all I mean I wasnt expecting much coming into this place I shouldnt have expected anything here

I was in the mood for some red meat and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes So I didnt mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side The boolgogee plain simply plain There was a salad with the boolgogee but it too was plain There wasnt nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of 8 because the salad and rice probably didnt cost more than 050 to make

Oh the sushi All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy By spicy I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming I tried a few bites of the 34 different rolls we got After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite We paid 18 for the food even after the coupon and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper higher quality sushi at Teharu

This place is a ripoff for sushi in my opinion Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag The sad part is that the interior is very well done if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting"
5,I stop here every Monday night and negate two hours of spinning and yoga by indulging in Mexican comfort food My wife swears by the carne asado tacos the cheese enchiladas ring my bell Although I phone in my order the parking lot is always an adventure However the one night a young Hispanic girl celebrating her birthday in the restaurants limited outdoor sitting area insisted I come over for a glass of milk and slice of her cake negated all the encounters with strange transients
5,"Pei Weis has nothing on the fabulous food at TOTTS  The menu is awesome  try anything  The owner Young is such a nice man and will always help you understand the menu or make recommendations  In fact one time we told him we wished a certain dish was spicier we really like hotttt food and he told us to just ask next time we were in and they would make it spicier  Everything on the menu is fabulous but some of my favorites are

Sweet and Pungent Chicken  all time favorite
Bourban Chicken
Twins Pork"
5,"As far as I know Im the only person in this town that has a dish named after them I could be wrong but Im pretty sure Im right I mean Im always right

By now if you read my reviews you know that I am vegan and I dont eat gluten This makes dining out quite an issue at times especially for breakfastbrunch 

I really wanted to hit up The Vig Uptown for brunch because I like it as a Happy Hour spot the space is incredible it is within a bike ride from my house and I love the Original Vig but alas there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me I gently mentioned in person and a few times on FaceBook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu

They listened
They created
They named after me

We stopped by for brunch this past Sunday for the dishes debut and got a personal hello from Tucker He was excited because they had already sold TEN AMber Scramblers that morning and it isnt even officially on the menu yet Im already a star

So whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler Amazing Seriously The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes They bring such a delicious flavor It certainly doesnt hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico

Ill be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the 5 fresh squeezed mimosas If you know whats good for you you will too"
1,I have been here a few times over the last 4 years and really liked it  It was horrible on Saturday night 528  I ordered the enchiladas with chicken  When it arrived there were 3 tiny enchiladas with an ounce of cheese inside the soggy tortillas and the with chicken part apparently meant a few chunks of chicken would be tossed on top  I was so disappointed but starving so I ate it  The guacamole was really disappointing too  I dont think we will go back again
1,"NO  Dont go Dont do it  This was my first visit and it was on a whim because we drive by it often  

One other reviewer here made a wise statement  go the grocery store and buy frozen fish  I promise it will be better than this"
1,"If you like sushi go somewhere else I was extremely disappointed in the quality of both the service and the food 

I decided to take my family here because the other reviews seemed good however either my experience was an anomaly or the other Phoenix yelpers and I have stark differences in taste

The staff had great smiles yet lacked follow through We had to ask for water and extra ginger twice The sushi rolls were the flimsiest I have ever seen Although poor in quality they were high in price for what they serve Im not sure about the names of some of their rollsone was named Climax Gross and just distasteful  

The decor and ambiance leave you wanting They have three different wallpapers hanging and the music is overwhelming 

Even though this is the only sushi bar in Surprise I will gladly drive to Peoria or Scottsdale the next time I have a craving for sushi"
5,Ive been to this location a few times but this was by far the best experience Ive had It was two Sundays ago myself and seven friends wanted to watch the early games and get some food and drinks My friend called ahead and made a reservation When we got there we had a big table reserved right in front of all the TVs Our waitress was very attentive friendly and quick They had a bunch of beer bucket deals that we all took advantage of and had a great time watching all the games enjoying some beverages and eating some food Their breakfast burrito with chorizo was fantastic and itll keep me coming back See ya next Sunday Majerles
5,"Aside from the Macys on 34th street in NY this one is my favorite store  They carry all my favorite designers especially for work clothes  Not to mention the shoe department always the hottest selection of pumps  Theres a tiny Ukrainian woman that works in the shoe department I love her she is SO patient with me and gives me her two cents as she keeps bringing out the shoes  

I wanna meet the buyer for this store and become herhis bestie  They also have a personal shopper near the womens dressing rooms  Not that Id ever have the need for one but you might  The sales people are always really nice and helpful

On a side note I once met this old guy who said he brought Janis Joplin to this store to buy panties when she did a show here  Ive always doubted that story but it never fails that when I go to the lingerie department I tell myself Im standing where the late great Janis stood  Shes one of my all times"
5,Toasted subs at their best   The worst part of eating here is trying to choose one sandwich out of my four or five favorite picks  And in the fall when they bring out the soups I can hardly resist ordering the cream corn soup with my meal
5,"First timers to this park on an early Sunday morning Me my bf and our 2 old English bulldogs had a great experience 

You can choose between the active or passive dog park We choose active but also decided to keep our dogs on leash being our first time and all 

We were immediately greeted by a woman and her 2 boxers very friendly We walked the perimeter of the park to get our dogs use to being around other dogs and talked to several people along the way 

We did have a small incident when a dog snapped at our dog but no harm no foul 

Looking forward to bringing the dogs here again"
1,"My husband and I went to Ernies a few weeks ago on a Saturday night because it is within walking distance to our house and there is always a crowd so we wanted to check it out We met our friends in the bar and waited and waited and waited and waited Still noone offered to take our drink order 

The bartenders and barbacks made eye contact but noone came near us We dont look like hooligans or ruffians or anything so it was irritating The weird thing was there were people eating in the booths around us and one or two other people at the bar who had drinks We finally got up and left Why waste money on places that wont take it I wont return and will recommend my friends dont either"
5,"Id have to say that among the restuarants in the Tom Jetland suite Fez Ticoz Switch Ticoz is my favorite because of its dimlylit loungelike quality which provides it a cozier feel than the other two  Add to that the hypnotic Mojito creations and Ticoz is one of those places I could spend an entire weekend late afternoon at as long as someone else drives of course

The tamales are fantastic and are more similar to corn pudding than to traditional hand rolled tamales  If you get them with veggies youll find that the veggies are a little oddly cut for the dish so I recommend some other topping  The beef is fantastic especially in the tacos

All in all this is one of my current favorites"
5,I lovelovelove Green  The atmosphere is wonderful and the food even better   The people who work here are lovely sweet and very helpful   There are far too few vegetarian restaurants in Phoenix metro area and this one gets my full support
5,"I have been here at least 10 times and have never had a complaint  The staff is friendly the food is great the atmosphere is lovely  

My favorites  the LB lavosh and spicy cottage cheese

I will continue to come back to Local Breeze again and again"
5,"Heard about this interesting steak house from Lindsay my Yelping go to and I am grateful What a fun night feeling Mad Men ish as we walked through the kitchen when entering the restuarant 

Atmosphere was amazing and the food WOW My fav had to be the amazing steak and bean chilisoup fantastic

Steaks were our of this world and the mushrooms devine

When entering the restaurant we greeted by helpful eager staff  with each one adding input into our experience especially Patti our server She was helpful informative fun and sealed the deal of a fantastic night Thanks"
5,"Fable III used AND looks brand new for 11  OH YEAH  Ill take it

I stumbled upon this place because our little cousin wanted to get a game and he had been here before with his aunt  

The place was filled with classic games all over the walls and even to play  Im guessing classic original games are back and in style again  Plus they are just fun to try or have a flashback from the 80s  

The store is clean open aisles to walk through great prices on the games and the customer service from Gary and Rich is phenomenal  These guys were very nice educated about the games and went out of there way to make everyone happy  Great job guys  

All the high star reviews are true  This place is SO much better than any other gaming place Ive been too  My husband loved it too  He was a kid in a candy store  

What a great find  I think you should take a trip to this store even if you dont play  Get a game as a gift  Just to experience this place it is something special and unique"
5,I love this place I have been here 2wice and it puts of the others in the country to shame I hope that I can volunteer here
5,Loved it Food was great service was great Not easy to find but worth the search
5,Im giving Bobby Q an extra star in this update to my previous review because although it has its share of hits and misses it is in fact as good as it gets in Phoenix for great barbecue I love barbecue It is a hobby of mine When I get stuck on something and want to know what it should look and taste like I go to Bobby Q and am almost never disappointed Most recently this happened with beef brisket Im going to upload a picture I took of Bobby Qs brisket because seriously if you look at it and dont want to immediately die from desire then you just dont like barbecue If I had anything bad at all to say about Bobby Q it would be that sometimes their meats can be slightly overdone but this is not the norm Their quality control considering how much food they must serve to keep up with the demand is astounding  Their prices are too high but of course youre paying for the almost Disneyesque atmosphere Their sauce is absolutely delicious although it should be noted they dont understand what spicy means All in all I really cant say enough good things about this place Go look at my brisket photo Seriously
5,"Headed back to Lobbys How I missed this tasty burger I wasnt disappointed with round 2 The burger was still fantastic Im also happy that the fries were a little bit less salty than my previous trip 

With any burger purchase getting the combo pack friessoda is the smart choice

I do wish that they would lose the styrofoam soda cups and offer more than one size of drinks

Make sure to grab plenty of napkins before you sit down The burger can make a mess with the homemade sauce dripping off the meat and bun Thats a good thing in my opinion"
5,Rivas helped me get through numerous late night study sessions and early morning hangovers  Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu but my two faves are the Carne Asada and Chile Rellano burritoswith fresh horchata of course
1,"Do Not Eat Here if you think a bathroom in any way has anything to do with the cleanliness of the food preperation  There was literally dried smeared feces on the toilet seat and the floor looked like it had never been washed  Of course the restroom cleaning checklist was not initialed the entire day OhI almost forgot there were no paper towels to dry my hands  I told one of the employess and he says I know dude  Its rediculous that the bathroom looks like this when you have 10 employess standing around with their thumbs up their asses gossiping 

Burger was overpriced  Milkshake was ok  Also no napkins anywhere in sight on the tables or at the bar area  Apparently napkins are something you have to ask for  Whoever owns this place needs to get a better manager at this facility because he is loosing money with all of the onetime customers who will choose to go somehwere else next time"

5,"As a bonafide recovering Art Bitch I give this university gallery the blue ribbon award for kickassery

Truly a hidden gem i hate that phrase in Tucson the collection and the revolving pieces never cease to impress me I have brought almost every single tourist from the east coast to this gallery including some photography professors and they leave with snoooty mouths agape that in this pleasant little desert town resides a highcaliber well manicured collection of the arts 

I am always upset when I visit and I cant stop by this galleryand dont miss out out on their catalogs magazines books postcards and prints they have in the atrium as unique giftsdecoration

Splleeeendid"
5,"This is one excellent Ethiopian restaurant rivals anything Ive sampled in Washington DC or Seattle  If I lived in Phoenix this would be a Top5 restaurant for me along with LoLos Chicken  Waffles  yum

Lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu  Many of the entrees are offered as small portions 450600 each  They suggest each diner order 23 of these to make a meal Kitfo and Lamb Tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many Ethiopian restaurants you can order combo plates meat combo veggie combo house combo plate etc  This made deciding on our meal a little more complicated but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes

Our favorite dish ordered was the Lamb Tibs the spicy version with Awaze spice paste  Lamb was soooo tender and the spices were a delight  rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes  Good thing it comes as a full order  four of us were competing for bites  We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott beef in a spicy brown sauce that was some of the best Ive ever had  Again rich in flavor but not too spicy  My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo  choice beef sort of like steak tartar servered raw or lightly cooked but with Ethiopian spices  Lalibelas was pretty good just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott  The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent  especially the yellow lentils gomen collard greens and spicy Wott lentils

Staff was great  attentive helpful service  Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants this one is very userfriendly  Although in some cases  the menu accommodates American tastes it doesnt compromise on quality or authenticity  One note on the injera spongelike bread used to scoop up the entrees  its a mix of wheat flour and teff a grain indigenous to Ethiopia and I dont think its fermented like injera that is made with 100 teff  Im used to the latter but you can argue Lalibelas injera doesnt compete with the flavor of the entrees as much

All in all one of the best Ethiopian restaurants Ive been to and I have been to many in the States  Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good  Highly highly recommended"
5,"When I moved away these were the tacos that I missed 

I stopped back today and must say  it was exactly how I remembered  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced at 599 and come with two items and rice and beans I always get the hard taco  seasoned shredded beef lettuce and cheese in a deep fried corn tortilla  and the cheese enchilada I could eat the rice and beans alone both are so well seasoned and they definitely dont skimp on the cheese The only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit  some days its super hot others  not so much

The wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always try to help me because my Spanish is so limited The interior is large but very modest there arent a lot of fancy decorations  this is a place to come for the food and service and  not th ambiance 

Still one of my faves"
5,Great place for Sushi ordered the Musscles  Caution very large order even with only four Great wine Ordered Eel Crunch Roll Tuna Roll Soft Shell Crab Roll All of it was to die for A little Gem  Pricing is competitive not high or low Environment is pleasant service was wonderful and waitress was very helpful with suggestions and information
5,"Been here twice now and tried two different dogs and two sides Nothing was disappointing I have tried both the sweet and spicy dog and the hana dog Both dogs were great and had very distinct high points The sweet and spicy does something very rare for me and actually gets me to enjoy pineapple mixed with other foods I this dog had great flavors all over including the dog itself which was perfectly cooked and the right amount of heat The hana was just a stack of messy amazingness that had a real mexican flair The bacon is the real standout adding the great bacon flavor and a crunch that gives the textures some depth

The sides were good to The chili is not some canned stuff and is good The tater tots are just awesome though and nice crispy outside and that soft pillowy inside you crave

If you want a gourmet hot dog this place is not going to let you down"
1,AWFUL  Not sure it classifies as food  Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat  No salsa beans cheese sour cream guacamole  Nada  Plus they wont let you add anything to it  Everything is as is  The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted  The food was barely luke warm   Service is also mediocre  The salsa was gross  It was super water down  The best part of the meal was my Pepsi
5,"Best Cakes around

This may sound crazy but Ive never actually been in this place  But Ive tried so many different things they have  

My job goes through Karshs for all the anniversary cakes catering and special events  We get cookies cakes and other assorted pieces of heaven from Karshs  Recently my coworkers wanted to try something different  They got an eclaire cake balls and mini rainbow cakes  The rainbow cakes are the best thing to ever go in my mouth  I could eat those for days  They just melt in your mouth plus theyre covered with chocolate  What  Yes

My friends also got me a Karshs cake for my birthday a few years ago  I wish I had a picture of it  It was so pretty with a butterfly on it  And it tasted amazing

Though Ive never been a paying customer and Ive never walked through their door I love this place and highly recommend it for any event you may be throwing"
5,"This place does not disappoint  Ive been here quite a few times with coworkers and its always a good choice

Cute place  I especially like sitting on their cozy covered patio  

I hate mushrooms but somehow LOVE their fungi pizza  I think its the truffle oil that makes it amazing  Ive had a few of their other pizzas too which are quite good as well All of their salads are delish  you cant go wrong with any of them

If theres just one other person with you you cant go wrong sharing a pizza and a salad

This place is WAY better than Pizzeria Bianco

Will continue to come back here"
5,"Im not generally a big fan of burgers but I love this place  Their blu burger is amazing  Bleu cheese crumbles carmelized onions and thick crispy bacon on an awesome onion bun oh my  I highly recommend adding avocado to it as well  I cant speak for the other sandwiches because I love the blu burger too much to order anything new Heh

The zucchini fries are a thing of beauty AND they allow wellbehaved dogs to hang out with you on the patio while you enjoy your meal  They even brought my little guy a disposable water bowl

Ive also had great luck with their waitstaff everyone is friendly and on task  Its pretty busy on a Friday or Saturday night but just perfect for a Saturday afternoon lunch"
1,"THIS PLACE SUCKS  It really deserves NO STARS

You can only like this place if you dont know anything about Vietnamese food 

What I tried

Bun Bo Hue  Broth didnt even taste like Bun Bo Hue  Spicy but has no flavor  Wheres the beef shank or hogs feet  You cant have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hogs feet  They use the cheapest cuts of meat  This item was on their Daily Special  

Pho Chin Nam  The broth was super sweet  You know what that meansMSG galore  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth  How can you specialize in Pho if you cant even make the broth taste right

Service stinks  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it  The dude never refill the water ask how things were etc

Vegetable platter was not fresh  Bean sprouts were starting to brown 

If you cant cook something why even bother serving it to customers  I dont know about other entrees they offer but I wont be coming back to find out  

This has to be one of the worse Vietnamese restaurant in the valley 

Check out my extensive list of Vietnamese Restaurants for suggestions to better ones"
5,My favorite sushi restaurant ever I love their ama ebi nigiri sweet shrimp and always craving for more For this visit I tried their dynamite scallop roll and salmon roll with asparagus inside and it was so delicious makes me craving for more The pork ribs were very delicate and it was melting in your mouth What makes this restaurant to be my number one spot of Japanese restaurant in the valley was the sushi chef service is superb They ran out ama ebi and I told the waitress that one of the reason I came there is for that ama ebi The chef suddenly came back to me one hour later and said he saved one ama ebi for me What a service Im so thankful of this wonderful dining experience and will definitely become one of their regular customer Love this place so much
1,Horrible service
1,"I love Saddle Ranch for its casual night time festivities including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe but I cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting

When I think of my meal this past Friday night I think of two words dry and cold The spinach artichoke dip was just okay  a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonalds maybe even worse The BBQ burger turkey patty was dry and tasteless as was the bacon Really It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless There are a few things that the menu has going for itself  a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and though Im not much of a beer drinker the beer tower looks pretty badass

For me I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere but I will definitely be staying away from the grub Adios cowboy"
5,"Love it love it love it I have been eating at various Pita Jungles around the Valley since I moved to AZ over 6 years ago and I have yet to have anything that I didnt love My favorites include the Black Bean Burger Lentil Fetoosh Salad all three hummus types dolmas and gazpacho but everything is delicious so you really cant go wrong The Tempe location also has breakfast which is amazing 

Each location is fairly small so luch and dinner may require a short wait but its worth it The prices are fair and the portions are huge Dont be afraid to split a dish with a loved one"
5,"I know Kerrie through my networking and we benefit from her presence

I have not needed her services and most of us dont plan on needing an attorney But I am always reminded by a tagline that Kerrie often mentions 

People in crisis need company Droban  Company 

How very true When that time comes and in these troubled days it WILL You will need good company I would look for Kerrie to help and so should you"
5,We had brunch at El Chorro today and it was wonderful The patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters The service was outstanding The food was delicious I had the creme brulee french toast  it was carbsugar heaven Everyone else enjoyed their food The eggs benedict came out perfect The BLT looked awesome The fries were delicious We will definitely be back
5,"I have a fond place in my heart for this establishment

Ive been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for 10 years

Ive lived all over the world

I always crave three things when Im not living in Phoenix or the USA
1  Skim Milk
2  Mexican food
3  Tokyo Express

Now pay attention

If you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce heres what you should order

An all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowl
5 extra sides of spicy sauce
A small salad
2 extra sides of salad dressing

Ok so I REALLY like sauce  Really

This place makes me want to cry I love it so much"
5,"Cork is an enigma

What makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is Too good for Chandler and maybe too good for the valley

The portions are just right and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton Im 63 200lbs and I was satisfied  If you want large portions though go to their lunchbrunches  Ive been there twice and had The Lamb Chop which was amazing on all levels and Ive had some serious lamb in rural Bosnia which has been labeled the best in their country sure enough corks stood up blow for blow  The other entrée I experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken  I was so amazed by the lamb the first time that I had to try something more simple in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places  Lets just say the chicken was not regular it was outstanding  The appetizers are crazy good can anyone say king crab legs

The wine selection is top notch  the booze selection is killin and they even make this amazing Italian lemon stuff thats like 90 alcohol  make sure you have a designated driver because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest

Go to Cork because its that damn good"
5,Went to Yogurt Kingdom for the first time tonight  It was perfect  Lots of flavors to choose from  My favorite is the Tart Vanilla  But I got a large cup and tasted at least 8 different flavors and I enjoyed each and everyone  I wanted to go back and get some more of the Tart Vanilla but my husband gave me one of those looks when I suggested it  You can either eat inside or outside  The place is decorated so cute   There was a very cute and well mannered girl to greet us and told us how it all worked just in case we had not been there before   They offered to give us any samples that we might like to try  There was a gentleman there who turned out to be the owner  He was very kind friendly person  and glad that we stopped in   The bathroom was very clean and the entire place was tidy and well maintained   We will be back very soon  I would recommend this place to others that like yogurt  You wont be disappointed
5,"I find it hilarious that someone would reference this place as being terrible  compare it to overpriced and bland Humble Pie and in the same breath say it was the best chili relleno you ever tasted

 I cant vouch for the chicken tacos but most street tacos are nowhere near packed with meat By definition they are usually very tiny with onionssome guacamole a little cabbage and some small cuts of meat  I can say the tilapia tacos are topslarge filet on each on the list of my girlfriends quest for good fish tacos I can say the pork nachos are the best I have had as the pork reminds me of Los Dos Molinos in a small way The empanadas are excellent as well

If you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for 6 bucks You can also get 2 large fish tacos for 6 bucks Would you like some awesome tortilla soup 4 bucks
If you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans I think it sets you back about 11 bucks I have also had the chili relleno and it is the best I have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything why the venom

I learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first When I asked they said the chili relleno pork empanadas and red sangrias Guess how my dining experience went Try ordering tacos from Los Dos Molinos and you will leave pissed Order the green chili pork and you will drive 100 miles for it

I do hope you give it another chance I have honestly never had anything sub par here in my 7 or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do  I agree that Main Ingredient is great also thats why I took the time to write about it 

But to reiterate

1113 dollar for most dinner items besides new york stripon the list to try is not pricey

happy hour has most items for 46

street tacos are not bursting with meat

ask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want

Humble Pie  was more pricey and not worth it All it does is take up parking from a much better place next door For a place with the reference to pizza in its name you would think it would be better it tasted like peter piper

I would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuys but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotleranch like sauce which is similar"
5,LOVE Five Guys
5,This is a great Mexican food restaurant I eat here for lunch once a week and have never had a bad meal The Asada y Enchilada is my favorite dish If you are an avocado lover like me  this is the place to go I always order extra avocado because they have the best and ripest avocados I have had anywhere
1,HipsterTrendy I think NOT  Very disappointingweird crowd  older men on the prowl   and unfriendly bartenders w lots of attitude Ive given this a few tries thinking I just hit it on a bad night  but wont be going back So many other great places in Scottsdale to visit 
5,"So Jimmy tell the class what you saw at Sweeties

OK well I saw lots of candy Oldtimey candy and cool candy and neat candy Lots of it Real lots

And I saw people walking around with baskets and talking about candy And talking about candy when they were little  And talking about what candy they should get for their kids

Oh and I saw Turkish Taffy Maple Bun Bars Fruit Stripe Gum Moon Pies Cherry Mash Mary Janes Valomilk Candy BarsSen Sen Packs Goo Goo Clusters Squirrel Nut Zippers Flipstick Lipstick Licorice Pipes Zero Bars Twin Bings Look Bars AbbaZabba Bars and UNo Bars  And that was only a little of it  And lots of other stuff

Teach

Yes Jimmy

The coolest teacher ever would take her class to Sweeties

Would they

Yes"
5,Standard Mexican fare  but quite delicious  Pitcher of frozen margaritas was yummy too  Fast and friendly service
5,"My profile says

My Last Meal On Earth Chicken and Waffles

Lo Los is the reason why  Everytime I visit Arizona I make sure I hit this spot up  I usually order the Lo Los meal which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken with 3 waffles and a scoop of butter with syrup  YUM  This meal would not be complete without ordering their super delicious Sweet Tea which is served in a glass jar  

There are two locations one in lower Phoenix and the other in Scottsdale  The one in lower Phoenix is the original location  However its much smaller so wait times could vary  The Scottsdale location is much bigger  so dealing with long wait times should not be as big of a  problem

Winner Winner Chicken Dinner Lunch and Breakfast please"
5,"Treats We tried the cookies chocolate chip and chocolate truffle and would have to give them 5stars Delicious  
Breakfast Seems like they changed the recipe for the turkey maple sausage so it now has an odd herb flavor and less maple flavor but tried the flattened meatball and liked it so might switch to that option 
If you go be sure to check out the bathrooms Each one was decorated uniquely by a staff member and  the sinks are shared by both genders You also get to see how very clean kitchen the kitchen is as you walk to the bathrooms so that is a great bonus  Overall a great nonchain place for unique and delicious food"
5,"I first joined 24 hr fitness about a year ago and I have had nothing but good experiences with the staff since the first day that I came in  The people behind the front desk have always been very kind and attentive to my needs  If I ever have a question or concern it is always promptly answered or dealt with  Some of them have even taken the time to learn my name and greet me as soon as I walk in the door It is very impressive and makes for a very pleasant experience 


On another note I have been training with Trace for about 6 months now  My goal was to lose a little bit of weight and tone up my body and I could not be happier with the results In 6 months I have lost 12 lbs and I look and feel amazing He is incredibly knowledgeable about training and nutrition giving his clients hard workouts as well as meal plans  Trace is the total package

TIP Try Traces boot camp on Wednesday evenings at 730  They will kick your butt"
5,Leah the trainer at Dog House Training Academy is great Shes friendly knowledgable and makes herself available via email or phone should you have any questions Her knowledge on dogs is extensive and even though youre just paying for the class shell gladly offer up advice on any issues you may be having with your dog The classes seemed simple enough to me but there was a client in my class that just wasnt picking it up at all and blatantly disregarding her techniques I was impressed with how Leah handled the situation and the customer Shes very thorough and always explains why she does things the way she does and why it works So there are no questions and its always made perfect sense to me With the quality of service and the knowledge that you get to tap into while youre training with Leah you just cant find a better deal out there Her rates are competitive and she offers referral discounts too
5,"This place is super cute lunch joint  I had the sloppy joe special and it reminded me of a home cooked meal back in the day  I ended my meal with a classic vanilla milkshake which was superb  Oh yeah  if youre in a hurry for a quick good sit down lunch this place is it  our food came out SO fast  I will be returning shortly

You also MUST check out the vintage clothing furniture in the room next door before you leave "
5,"The staff is great the food is great even the cappuccino is great had my first one today

i work close by and I have a choice where to eat and its very often Acacia for breakfast and lunch

A few of my favs are

 Chicken Salad Sandwich
 Southwest Ranch Salad
 Omelets

Enjoy maybe Ill run into you there"
5,Wow  Went on a Sunday around 11am  busy but not packed  Roomy and comfortable  GREAT food  Bacon meaty and tasy  I had the french toast on recommendation and it was fantastic  Great atmospherejust an all around great place  We were in from LA for a baseball game and wanted a nonchain local place and found this place on Yelp  Glad we went
5,When I lived in Phoenix I was a regular at Fez My friends and I probably averaged twice a week and there were likely weeks when we were there more The atmosphere is really wonderful a rarity in Phoenix The food is very consistent and almost everything on the menu is unique and flavorful I must agree with some of the other reviews that the waitstaff is very hitormiss Ive had wonderful service and terrible service and there are times when Ive had to go and ask the bartender to send someone over to our table to take our order as regulars in particular I wouldnt think that this would be something we would have to deal with That being said there was one time when they were understaffed and the manager was very apologetic and even sent us a bunch of appetizers free of charge as an apology so I havent personally experienced the attitude that others report I miss Fez now I live in San Diego When I go to visit its always on the itinerary every time usually as soon as I land
5,"Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer that is until last evenings change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe  Cantina  I am not an expert on authentic Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like however I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it  

We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinals loss  Sad I know since they were off to a great start  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter aka the bartender  Phil no need to blush if you read this did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar no salt heavy on the tequila preferencesand that was just to start  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand check  Now what to eat for dinner  

My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano 1895 while I couldnt decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema yumm and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce or tinga Poblana sauce1895  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and once again my dinner friend had order envy  Thats not to say his Mole was par or dare I say subpar because it wasnt  it actually has received many culinary awards being named Best Mole both locally and nationally but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach perfectly sautéed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla isAMAZZZZZZING  Its also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides as we ordered they also offer up tacos 3 at 1095 various quesadillas  595 and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole salads and more  

Deciding Id save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert  Undecided again and so we trusted our gastronomy guide Phil to choose  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do   

Thank you Phil and Los Sombreros for the memorable dining experience  The food was outstanding margaritas made by Phil are the best and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood Azucena Tovar and congrats on almost turning 20 years old"
5,This is the place for a fabulos breakfast I have friends who visit from Texas and they wait all year to eat the Eggs Benedict here They are the best I  personally love the pancakes smothered in bannanas pecans and hot syrupyummmmy They also serve some very healthy and delicious salds for lunch like the strawberry spinach salad and the sandwhiches ar e very good Their is often a wait for breakfast but it moves fast and their is a community table which sometimes shortens the wait
5,"Highly recommend This is my second time here and I see 3 on the way
Ive had the bistec encebollado  arroz imperial with shrimp no melted cheese I do recommend both plates Next time I will try ropa vieja
Great service Ask for Kelly"
5,"5 stars for the great 5 happy hour specials the short rib tacos and the fish tacos are delicious and a bargain at 5 for 5 bucks My favorite drink is the green tea lemonadeit was heavy on the liqour and so refreshing

Service was flawless We were greeted hello and goodbye by two cheerful hostesses our waiter and waitress offered great suggestions and the bar tender was sweet as well"
5,"We brought the entire family to Giuseppes last night for a preThanksgiving meal yes thats right  my family likes to carb up for all of the eating we do today  We brought a ton of wine and had a great time  Franco was our waiter  and Im guessing since all the ladies at the table had a crush on him that he is the waiter Sheila B wrote about in her review too  Nice eye candy

I absolutely love the eggplant rollatini and pretty much order it every visit  We usually start with a Giuseppes Salad and finish with a dessert to share  My favorite is the white chocolate tartufa

Pasquale pictured above is the sweetest man and makes the experience extra special every single time  

Since Im writing this review on Thanksgiving I want to give thanks to Pasquale and Ristorant Giuseppe for all the good times Ive had there and all of the good times to come  Salud"
1,"Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast Low and behold the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didnt put something in the bag

And this time it was the yeast

I love the food there but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who cant be bothered to do their goddamn jobs I am so sick of this crap with this corporation Maybe its a Phoenix thing or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods In a place like Phoenix where you have alternatives such as Sprouts youd think Whore Foods would smarten up

Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is and they just walk by with their nose high in the air I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that youre a super star but I dont work with you I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk so do your goddamn job Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist 

But alas Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for

Oh yea one other thing take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores It didnt stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower

Useless motherfs"
1,The food is delicious  The service  discriminatory  The bartender blonde gentlemen went around to everyone else then finally acknowledge us  This is embarrassing I dont know what else to say
5,Great food and service Country food at its best
5,Yes I do rock the hipster joints  I dig this place  A little bit of a scene but the food is solid and the service is great Hard not like it  All in all a great spot  I tend to switch up my favorites but I typically hit this up for breakfast when in the 602
5,"Only 4 stars 

A few notes The folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and I feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product Dining at a restaurant rate the service a lil harder but a coffee shop hold your tongue

Anyway this place rocks We arent super close but we pass up several coffee shops en route to Lola because the quality is top drawer

The beans fair trade and the roast is perfect The price of a bag of beans is amazing Doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast This is what is all about

I have yet to find a better americano A splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines Ive been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area and if I do find myself elsewhere I can only compare them to Lola and Lola wins out each time"
5,Im not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant especially when there are 3 subways all within a couple blocks of each other  I felt it was necessary in this case  My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park  The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome  They were really nice and friendly and quite chatty  One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding  The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back washed his hands threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted  WOW  This type of service has never happened at the other locations all of which I have been too  He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted  He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh  Its refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves  They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days  We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly  He was much more lively than most twentysomethings you meet  Amazing  Only in downtown do you meet people like that  This is a great Subway  Go here and skip the others
5,"Lets seewhat is there NOT to like about Surprise Stadium Well 950 tall cans of PBR is about all I could come up with and thats not a surprise pun intended considering youre attending a sporting eventeven spring training 

But as someone who does not living in Arizona and as someone who doesnt go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here Look youre lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost MLB baseball right in your back yard If I could Id live down here during March just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the Phoenix metro area each year 

I attended my first spring training game on March 12th 2012 at Surprise Stadium as the Royals took on the San Francisco Giants my favorite team Our seats Sec 112 Row J Seats 131415 were 25 bucks each around 30 bucks including service fees I mean we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the Giants dugout check out some of my pictures The stadium funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10000 people is big enough so you feel youre at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean 

Arriving to the park I was surprised pun unintended to see that parking was free an oddity when going to an event like this The stadium staff as mentioned by other reviews are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful I didnt have to wait long at the concession stands even if lines were a bit long The outfield is lined with a lawn area perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game Tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees 

I love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family Oh Giants won 21 Go Giants"
5,45 locations all 45 star average I think Arizona really has some fantastic Pizza options and Spinatos is at the top of my pizza fix list the semi sweet sauce is addictive great service fresh ingredients The Spicy Italian is my favorite The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs that make your body partsromantic when you think of their cookies BTW 530pm on a Tuesday when we left a 30 minute wait Its on the List
